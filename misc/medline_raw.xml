        <ab>Background: Anti-Black racism is prevalent in medicine, and anti-racism training is needed in medical education. One such training is the Presence 5 for Racial Justice (P5RJ) Curriculum which covers evidence-based anti-racism communication strategies that promote health equity for Black patients. The P5RJ Curriculum was developed using feedback from clinicians and trainees with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) experience. In this study, we identify themes in recommended anti-racism language and phrases that surveyed clinicians and trainees use to promote racial justice and health equity in clinical care for Black patients. Methods: Secondary analysis of survey responses to identify themes in qualitative data. Dataset: Survey responses of specific phrases for anti-racism communication based on P5RJ Curriculum feedback. Population studied: N = 50 respondents (27 clinicians, 17 medical trainees, 6 unreported) recruited through convenience sampling and listservs of clinicians with DEI experience. An inductive qualitative analysis was performed on survey responses to identify emerging themes. Results: Emerging themes from survey responses reflected four communication practices: "Inquiry" was the predominant practice (59%), followed by "Empathy" (25%), "Statements of Allyship" (9%), and "Self-Accountability" (8%). Conclusion: Inquiry and empathy may be predominant communication practices when addressing anti-Black racism in medicine. There is an opportunity to expand anti-racism communication tools with statements of self-accountability and allyship. Future research is necessary to analyze the patient voice on clinician communication practices that promote anti-racism in clinical care.</ab>

        <ab>This paper outlines practical tips for inclusive healthcare practice and service delivery, covering diversity aspects and intersectionality. A team with wide-ranging lived experiences from a national public health association's diversity, equity, and inclusion group compiled the tips, which were reiteratively discussed and refined. The final twelve tips were selected for practical and broad applicability. The twelve chosen tips are: (a) beware of assumptions and stereotypes, (b) replace labels with appropriate terminology, (c) use inclusive language, (d) ensure inclusivity in physical space, (e) use inclusive signage, (f) ensure appropriate communication methods, (g) adopt a strength-based approach, (h) ensure inclusivity in research, (i) expand the scope of inclusive healthcare delivery, (j) advocate for inclusivity, (k) self-educate on diversity in all its forms, and (l) build individual and institutional commitments. The twelve tips are applicable across many aspects of diversity, providing a practical guide for all healthcare workers (HCWs) and students to improve practices. These tips guide healthcare facilities and HCWs in improving patient-centered care, especially for those who are often overlooked in mainstream service provision.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: Immigrant seniors are among the most vulnerable demographic within Canadian society. Accounting for one-third of the senior population, these immigrants face unique challenges, including a lack of programming, language, socioeconomic and transportation barriers hindering societal integration, health, and well-being. Objective: This study uses a phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of immigrant seniors transitioning to Canadian society by considering their diversity of food knowledge and experiences. Method: Five immigrant seniors who could communicate in English in some capacities were recruited through social media, community organizations, and snowball sampling to participate in an interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were independently coded by the primary investigator and discussed with and verified by a second researcher to establish final themes and subthemes. Results: Participants represented different ethnic and demographic backgrounds. Participants identified several influences that shaped their experiences and identity as an immigrant senior. Three key themes emerged: Embracing change while preserving self; Food knowledge and experiences as an avenue for storytelling and; Identity and significant life changes as an immigrant senior. Conclusion: The experiences of immigrant seniors are a complex and multifaceted phenomenon manifesting in various ways. Habits, norms, and adaptations to novel circumstances are instrumental to these seniors' overall well-being and integration into a new environment. Significance: Food experiences may serve as a medium for understanding, coping with, and sharing differences within new cultural contexts. This medium may provide opportunities for dietitians and others to advance equity and inclusion of immigrant seniors in Canadian society. Funded by: None</ab>

          <atl>Validation of the Revised Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI-r) in the UK.</atl>

        <ab>As worldwide migration continues to grow, valid and reliable instruments are needed to assess the psychological processes that influence the successful management of intercultural relations in different sociopolitical contexts. In this study, we test whether the original Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI) required a revision to remain ‘fit for purpose’ in the current culturally plural context of the UK (MCI-r). Specifically, six subscales are proposed to underlie the construct of a multicultural ideology: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. With data from 300 UK nationals, we tested the psychometric properties of the MCI-r using various confirmatory factor analysis techniques to estimate the scale’s factor structure followed by convergent and discriminant validity tests. The results indicated that a 4-factor solution (Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity) fitted the data best. All four subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity. All four subscales were also negatively correlated with a right-wing political orientation, whilst especially Social Interaction and Consequences of Diversity were positively associated with intergroup contact frequency across domains (work, family and friends and/or acquaintances). Finally, UK participants with personal migratory experiences reported a stronger belief in positive consequences of multiculturalism and more support for Social Interactions between members of different ethnic groups. Overall, findings provide first insights into the applicability of the MCI-r as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of multiculturalism within the present UK context.</ab>

        <ab>The subspecialty of Hospital Medicine (HM) has grown rapidly since the mid-1990s. Diversity and inclusion are often studied in the context of healthcare equity and leadership. However, little is known about the factors potentially associated with choosing this career path among US medical students.</ab>
        <ab>We analyzed the results of the Annual Association of American Medical Colleges Survey administered to Graduating medical students from US medical schools from 2018 to 2020.</ab>
        <ab>We analyzed 46,614 questionnaires. 19.3% of respondents (N = 8,977) intended to work as a Hospital Medicine [HM] (unchanged from 2018 to 2020), mostly combined with specialties in Internal medicine (31.5%), Pediatrics (14.6%), and Surgery (9.1%). Students interested in HM were significantly more likely to identify as female, sexual orientation minorities (Lesbian/Gay or Bisexual), Asian or Black/African-American, or Hispanic. Role models and the ability to do a fellowship were strong factors in choosing HM, as was higher median total debt ($170,000 vs. $155,000). Interest in higher salary and work/life balance negatively impacted the likelihood of choosing HM. There were significant differences between students who chose IM/HM and Pediatrics/HM.</ab>
        <ab>About one in five US medical students is interested in HM. The probability of choosing future HM careers is higher for students who identify as sexual or racial minorities, with a higher amount of debt, planning to enter a loan forgiveness program, or are interested in doing a fellowship.</ab>

        <ab>Solutions to complex and unprecedented global challenges are urgently needed. Overcoming these challenges requires input and innovative solutions from all experts, including Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). To achieve diverse inclusion from ECOPs, fundamental changes must occur at all levels-from individuals to organizations. Drawing on insights from across the globe, we propose 5 actionable pillars that support the engagement of ECOPs in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability: sharing knowledge through networks and mentorship, providing cross-boundary training and opportunities, incentivizing and celebrating knowledge co-design, creating inclusive and participatory governance structures, and catalyzing culture change for inclusivity. Foundational to all actions are the cross-cutting principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, the pillars are cross-boundary in nature, including collaboration and innovation across sectors, disciplines, regions, generations, and backgrounds. Together, these recommendations provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future.</ab>

        <ab>Differential rewarding of work and experience has been a longtime feature of academic medicine, resulting in a series of academic disparities. These disparities have been collectively called a cultural or minority "tax," and, when considered beyond academic medicine, exist across all departments, colleges, and schools of institutions of higher learning-from health sciences to disciplines located on university campuses outside of medicine and health. A shared language can provide opportunities for those who champion this work to pool resources for larger impacts across the institution. This article aims to catalog the terms used across academic medicine disciplines to establish a common language describing the inequities experienced by Black, Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Women, and other underrepresented people as well as queer, disabled, and other historically marginalized or excluded groups. These ideas are specific to academic medicine in the United States, although many can be used in academic medicine in other countries. The terms were selected by a team of experts in equity, diversity, and inclusion, (EDI) who are considered national thought leaders in EDI and collectively have over 100 years of scholarship and experience in this area.</ab>

        <ab>A mixed methods survey was conducted at a health sciences library to assess patrons' perceptions of the library's digital and physical environments in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</ab>
        <ab>Developed by the library's DEI Team and preceded by a pilot assessment, the survey posed 17 Likert Scale questions and 2 free-text response questions on the topics of belonging, inclusivity, equitability, emotional and physical safety, and commitment to DEI. The survey was created in Qualtrics, pilot tested, and launched in February 2020 for approximately 12 weeks.</ab>
        <ab>Objective question responses were received from 101 individuals, with 24 open-ended responses. The quantitative findings showed largely positive perceptions of the DEI climate. Questions about feeling welcome and feeling physically safe were among those with the highest responses. The three lower-scoring questions indicate areas for improvement, including services for people whose native language is not English, for individuals with disabilities, and for families. The qualitative findings indicate the library's strengths include its exhibitions, welcoming atmosphere, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity initiatives. In contrast, opportunities for enhancement encompass non-English language resources, website updates, and accessibility to some physical spaces.</ab>
        <ab>The DEI Team is using the online survey data to enhance library services, staffing, programming, policies, and spaces. These improvements include looking into providing a space for patrons with families, expanding services for individuals whose first language is not English, assessing library accessibility for people with physical disabilities, and enhancing the physical space with quiet areas, improved lighting, and meditation spaces. Employee DEI training is ongoing, using results from a training needs survey to identify knowledge gaps. The library has a history of successful partnerships with campus entities, which will help the DEI Team to move forward with their work.</ab>

        <ab>Equity and inclusivity in STEM research has become a larger topic of discussion in recent years, however researchers and scientists with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses are often missing from these conversations. Further, while field research is a major research component for some STEM disciplines, it is unclear what accessibility barriers or accommodations exist across the field sciences. Field research can sometimes involve harsh environments, topography, and weather, that present challenges to those with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses. A large and coinciding obstacle standing in the way of field research accessibility is the ableism present across science and academia, resulting in and from a lack of prioritization of attention and funding from universities and institutions. Biological field stations have been shown to be valuable not only as infrastructure for field-based research, but also as providing resources towards the scientific education of students and scientific outreach initiatives for the general public. As such, biological field stations are perfectly positioned to reduce barriers in research inclusion and accessibility for students and scientists with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses. The current work presents the results of a survey meant to inventory the presence or absence of accessible infrastructure across field stations, with responses spanning 6 countries and 24 USA states. Our results highlight a number of accessibility deficits, in areas such as accessible entrances, kitchens, and bathrooms. Our results suggest that (1) biological field stations have significant variability in accessibility with significant deficits especially in non-public-facing buildings used primarily by staff and researchers, and (2) field stations would benefit from an increase in federal funding opportunities to expedite their progress towards compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. We propose potential solutions to field work infrastructure spanning a range of financial costs, with emphasis on the point that efforts towards accessibility do not require an "all or nothing" approach, and that any step towards accessibility will make field stations more inclusive. Additionally, we further suggest that federal funding sources, such as the NSF and NIH, as well as university leadership, should consider broadening diversity initiatives to promote the continuation of, and increased accessibility of, university-affiliated field stations.</ab>

        <ab>No published data exists regarding per diem pay differences between the 50 United States (U.S.) Boards of Pharmacy.</ab>
        <ab>The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the per diem pay rate of Board of Pharmacy members for each state in the U.S. Compensation for mileage and meals, as well as demographic information regarding U.S. Board of Pharmacy members was also evaluated.</ab>
        <ab>In June 2022, each state Board of Pharmacy was contacted to gather data including per diem pay, mileage and meal compensation, number of meetings per year, number and gender of Board members, length of appointment, and regulatory statutes.</ab>
        <ab>The average per diem pay for Board members was $75.86 (median = $50.00, range = $0.00 to $250.00, n = 48 states). Most states report paying Board members for mileage (95.1%, n = 39 of 41) and meals (80.0%, n = 28 of 35). On average, Boards are composed of 8.3 members (median = 7.5, range = 5-17, n = 50), meet 8.3 times annually (median = 8, range 3-16, n = 47), and have a 4.5 year length of appointment (median = 4, range = 3-6, n = 47). Men represented 61.2% of occupied Board positions and pharmacists accounted for 74.2% of all positions. The average year for per diem pay statute update was 2002.</ab>
        <ab>The per diem pay for U.S. Board of Pharmacy members varies from state to state, ranging from unpaid (n = 8 states) up to $250.00 per diem. Fair compensation, increased pharmacy technician and women representation, and more timely pharmacy statute updates are necessary in order to achieve inclusion, diversity, and equity across state Boards of Pharmacy.</ab>

        <ab>Sponsorship, distinct from mentorship or coaching, involves advancing the careers of individuals by nominating them for roles, increasing the visibility of their work, or facilitating opportunities. Sponsorship can open doors and enhance diversity; however, achieving desirable outcomes requires equitable approaches to cultivating potential in sponsees and promoting their success. The evidence on equitable sponsorship practices has not been critically examined, and this special communication reviews the literature, highlighting best practices.</ab>
        <ab>Sponsorship addresses an unmet need for supporting individuals who have historically been afforded fewer, less visible, or less effective opportunities for upward career mobility. Barriers to equitable sponsorship include the paucity of sponsors of underrepresented identity; smaller and underdeveloped networks among these sponsors; lack of transparent, intentional sponsorship processes; and structural inequities that are associated with recruitment, retention, and advancement of diverse individuals. Strategies to enhance equitable sponsorship are cross-functional, building on foundational principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion; patient safety and quality improvement; and insights from education and business. Equity, diversity, and inclusion principles inform training on implicit bias, cross-cultural communication, and intersectional mentoring. Practices inspired by patient safety and quality improvement emphasize continuously improving outreach to diverse candidates. Education and business insights emphasize minimizing cognitive errors, appreciating the bidirectional character of interactions, and ensuring that individuals are prepared for and supported in new roles. Collectively, these principles provide a framework for sponsorship. Persistent knowledge gaps are associated with timing, resources, and systems for sponsorship.</ab>
        <ab>The nascent literature on sponsorship is limited but draws on best practices from various disciplines and has potential to promote diversity within the profession. Strategies include developing systematic approaches, providing effective training, and supporting a culture of sponsorship. Future research is needed to define best practices for identifying sponsees, cultivating sponsors, tracking outcomes, and fostering longitudinal practices that are sustainable at local, regional, and national levels.</ab>

        <ab>Racism has implicit and explicit manifestations that perpetuate disparities and negatively influence patient-centered health outcomes. Subsequently, a list of action items was provided to assist medical schools in becoming anti-racist institutions. A deep subject matter knowledge, beliefs, and reflections were a driving force for the management of medical schools or faculty members involved in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education to move forward toward inclusion of anti-racism in traditional medical curriculum or adapting existing training modules on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This paper proposes twelve practical and specific tips for implementing and teaching anti-racism in medical education. These twelve tips elaborate on the proposed actions for leaders in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, valuable for designing future curricula and educational activities.</ab>

        <ab>Transforming the University of Southern California health care system requires that institutions and organizations position equity, diversity, inclusion (EDI), and anti-racism central to their missions. The purpose of this administrative case report was to describe a systematic approach taken by an academic physical therapy department to develop a comprehensive antiracism plan that engages all interested and affected parties and includes processes for sustainable, long-term engagement.</ab>
        <ab>Four strategies contributed to organizational change towards anti-racism: Holding Ourselves Accountable; Developing a Plan; Building Consensus; and Providing Education, Support, and Resources. The attitudes of faculty and staff about racism and anti-racist actions were assessed through surveys at the start of the process and after and 1 year. Engagement in activities, meetings, and trainings related to EDI and anti-racism were logged for faculty and staff.</ab>
        <ab>From November 2020 through November 2021, several outcomes were achieved including: making structural organizational changes; including EDI in the faculty merit review; developing a bias reporting mechanism; establishing faculty development activities, resources, and groups; and implementing structured efforts to recruit a diverse cohort. Within that year, faculty and staff engaged in 99.32 hours of EDI and anti-racism trainings, workshops, and resource groups. Survey data showed persistent high support and commitment to EDI and anti-racism. Faculty and staff reported that they felt more equipped to identify and address individual and institutional racism and they reported risking their reputations to talk about race more often. Confidence in their ability to identify and resolve conflicts related to microaggressions, cultural insensitivity, and bias improved. However, their self-reported ability to identify and address structural racism remained unchanged.</ab>
        <ab>By approaching anti-racism as transformative rather than performative, an academic physical therapy department was able to develop and implement a comprehensive anti-racism plan with high support and engagement.</ab>
        <ab>The physical therapy profession has not been immune to racism and health injustice. Organizational change to become anti-racist is imperative for excellence and a necessary challenge to undertake if the physical therapy profession is to transform society and improve the human experience.</ab>

        <ab>A core component of NCCN's mission is to improve and facilitate equitable cancer care. Inclusion and representation of diverse populations are essential toward this goal of equity. Within NCCN's professional content, inclusivity increases the likelihood that clinicians are prepared to provide optimal oncology care to all patients; within NCCN's patient-facing content, it helps ensure that cancer information is relevant and accessible for all individuals. This article describes changes that have been made in the language and images used in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) and the NCCN Guidelines for Patients to promote justice, respect, and inclusion for all patients with cancer. The goals are to use language that is person-first, nonstigmatizing, inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities, and anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-fat-biased. NCCN also seeks to incorporate multifaceted diversity in images and illustrations. NCCN is committed to continued and expanding efforts to ensure its publications are inclusive, respectful, and trustworthy, and that they advance just, equitable, high-quality, and effective cancer care for all.</ab>

        <ab>This 2023 updated protocol summarizes the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology's (AACE's) new framework for the development of clinical practice guidelines and other guidance documents that includes changes to methodology, processes, and policies.</ab>
        <ab>AACE has critically reviewed its development processes for guidance documents over the last several years against the National Academy of Medicine Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies Principles for Development of Specialty Society Clinical Guidelines to determine areas for improvement.</ab>
        <ab>The new AACE framework for development of guidance documents incorporates many changes, including a revised conflicts of interest (COI) policy; strengthened commitment to collection of disclosures and management of relevant COI during development; open calls to membership for authors; new requirements for authors; new diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policy; new empanelment process that incorporates consideration of DEI; and adoption of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to increase the quality of evidence assessment and standardize recommendation grades and statements, among other improvements.</ab>
        <ab>AACE has revised its policies and adopted a completely new methodology for guideline development in support of the mission to elevate the practice of clinical endocrinology to improve patient care. With the use of an evidence-based medicine framework and by continually assessing and improving its processes for development of guidance, AACE strives to deliver trustworthy, unbiased, and up-to-date information that ensures clinician and patient confidence in AACE content. Further, AACE hopes that these enhancements foster a more collaborative approach to development and increase engagement with the worldwide medical community to improve global health.</ab>
        <ab>Disclosures R.C. is the current chair of the AACE CPG Oversight Committee, a member of the AACE Board of Directors, and in leadership positions at the American Medical Association, Western Endocrine Alliance, American Federation of Medical Research, Association of Program Directors in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, and Endocrine Society.

        <ab>Bias-free content in nursing education prepares students to provide equitable care. The process of assessing content promotes the dismantling of systemic bias in health care, advancing social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Unfortunately, there are no published studies to guide the evaluation of nursing curricula for the presence of bias. This innovative project aimed to identify bias in a course and develop a structure to guide the wider evaluation of the curriculum to identify and remove biased content. A modified version of the Upstate Bias Checklist was applied to a 15-week, three-semester hour, prelicensure, graduate-level nursing course.</ab>

        <ab>This perspective piece has two goals: first, to describe issues related to artificial intelligence-based applications for cancer control as they may impact health inequities or disparities; and second, to report on a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of artificial intelligence-based tools for cancer control to ascertain the extent to which discussions of justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, or health disparities manifest in syntheses of the field's best evidence.</ab>
        <ab>We found that, while a significant proportion of existing syntheses of research on AI-based tools in cancer control use formal bias assessment tools, the fairness or equitability of models is not yet systematically analyzable across studies. Issues related to real-world use of AI-based tools for cancer control, such as workflow considerations, measures of usability and acceptance, or tool architecture, are more visible in the literature, but still addressed only in a minority of reviews. Artificial intelligence is poised to bring significant benefits to a wide range of applications in cancer control, but more thorough and standardized evaluations and reporting of model fairness are required to build the evidence base for AI-based tool design for cancer and to ensure that these emerging technologies promote equitable healthcare.</ab>

        <ab>Radiology remains one of the least diverse fields in medicine. With increasing understanding of the benefits of workforce diversity on health care outcomes, radiology society leadership and radiologists are engaging in necessary efforts to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. To date, much of the initiatives have focused on pipeline development and recruitment strategies. Literature from organizational psychologists, human resources and business strategists suggest that incorporation of inclusion could overcome some of the persistent barriers to workforce diversity. Using case studies from real-life residency programs, we describe challenges associated with being a member of an underrepresented minority group in radiology. We illustrate concepts in inclusion, proposing concrete ideas for personal and institutional growth in this area, as a strategy for improving workforce diversity and team effectiveness.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: Management of personal leaves represents an important component of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. This study aims to understand the ways in which both training directors and fellows in neuropsychology training programs understand, perceive, communicate about, and plan for personal leaves during fellowship training. We also aim to provide empirically based recommendations for training directors communicating with fellows about personal leaves. Method: Training directors ( N  = 40) and postdoctoral fellows ( N  = 51) were recruited to complete surveys examining their knowledge and perspectives on personal leaves through a professional listserv. Results: While most training directors reported that their programs offer paid personal leave options, a substantial minority did not. There were discrepancies between training directors' and fellows' knowledge about leave policies and perceptions of the professional implications of taking a personal leave, such that fellows reported less knowledge and a greater perception that taking a leave during training may have a negative professional impact. Conclusions: Findings suggest that training directors in neuropsychology should clearly communicate institutional leave policies early in, or even before the start of, the fellowship period and work to cultivate a culture of openness around both broad issues of work-life balance and specific issues related to personal leaves with trainees.</ab>

        <ab>There is no consensus regarding values important for medical resident success, and current methods for selecting residents correlate poorly with success in residency.</ab>
        <ab>We developed and validated a set of values demonstrated by exemplary residents in the Internal Medicine-Pediatrics program at the University of Utah and used them to inform our resident selection process.</ab>
        <ab>We utilized a modified Delphi method to identify and internally validate values of successful residents. We implemented these values into the interview evaluation rubric.</ab>
        <ab>Four members of the Internal Medicine-Pediatrics residency program leadership and eleven current residents aided in value generation. Nine faculty from leadership positions in the residency programs of Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics formed a local expert panel for validation.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a literature review and engaged local stakeholders in a semi-structured group interview to generate 107 values. After consolidation based on redundancy, two iterative cycles of expert review using a modified Delphi approach, and alignment with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, eleven values achieved expert agreement and were integrated into an interview rubric to aid in resident selection.</ab>
        <ab>We identified eleven values important for resident success: academic strength, intellectual curiosity, compassion, communication, work ethic, teamwork, leadership, self-awareness, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), professionalism, and adaptability. The rank list from 2021 was found to correlate with a score based on values, but not Step 2 score, as it did in 2017.</ab>
        <ab>We applied a modified Delphi method to generate eleven observable values present in the ideal Internal Medicine-Pediatric resident at one academic health center in the Intermountain West. Higher Step 2 scores no longer correlated with higher ranking when we used these values to inform our rank list.</ab>

        <ab>Integrating diversity into healthcare systems has its challenges and advantages. Academic medicine strives to expand the diversity of the healthcare workforce. The Association of University Radiologists (AUR) put together a task force to review the concept of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) as it pertains to Radiology and to propose strategies for better integrating DEI in Radiology. We present several measures aimed at the trainee, leadership, management and professional society levels to empower DEI in Radiology.</ab>

        <ab>Meaningful use of data generated from electronic health records (EHRs) exerts influential impacts on every aspect of healthcare to facilitate clinically intelligent decision-making and improve healthcare outcomes. As nurses are called to chart a path of equity in healthcare, there presents a growing need of incorporating diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) perspectives into data courses generated from academic EHRs in academic informatics education. This paper describes the development of a DEI data standard model and the evaluation of data courses residing within an academic EHR platform using a cognitive walkthrough method. Data points selected for learning activities in the evaluated data courses appeared to be predominantly clinically driven and lack DEI-informed data features. To facilitate DEI-informed graduate health informatics education and the seamless transfer of health professional students to workforces, data courses built within academic EHRs should integrate DEI-informed data measures and thinking in course curriculum design and development.</ab>

        <ab>A retrospective cohort analysis of the Association of American Medical Colleges student records system and Electronic Residency Application Service for graduates entering a surgical specialty residency during graduate medical education training cycles 2015-2020.</ab>
        <ab>African American, Asian, and Hispanic applicants each accounted for less than 1% of graduates who reported entering a surgical training program. Asians (OR = 0.58, P = 0.01) and those identifying as other races (OR = 0.74, P = 0.01) were significantly less likely to enter a surgical subspecialty when compared to Caucasians. Orthopedic surgery contained the lowest proportion of minorities; African Americans 0.5% (n = 18), Asians 0.3% (n = 11), Hispanics 0.1% (n = 4), and others with 2% (n = 68). Females who reported entering Orthopedic surgery training represented the smallest female population in surgical specialties (17%, n = 527). The number of peer-reviewed publications was significantly associated with male sex (β = 0.28, P &lt; 0.01), age between 30 and 32 at graduation (β = 1.76, P &lt; 0.01), and identification as other races (β = 1.53, P &lt; 0.01).</ab>
        <ab>Racial minorities represented only 5.1% of graduates who reported entering a surgical specialty graduate medical education training program. Minority races and females were significantly less likely to enter a surgical subspecialty training program compared to Caucasian graduates and males, especially in orthopedic surgery. Implementation of specialty-specific programs and diversity, equity, and inclusion departments that promote mentorship and guidance toward residency programs is needed to combat continued race and sex disparities.</ab>

        <ab>The training competency of individual and cultural diversity is an advanced, fundamental competency to health service psychology since 2015. However, there is minimal instruction on how to integrate it into training curricula in neuropsychology, especially at the postdoctoral fellowship level. Our objective was to operationalize the individual and cultural diversity standard to provide a tangible application for educational programs on how to develop a competency-based training model for Latinx/a/o-Hispanic (L/H) cultural neuropsychology across the lifespan.</ab>
        <ab>The knowledge-based and applied-based competencies necessary to train to be a cultural neuropsychologist delivering services to L/H patients and families are defined. For learners to complete these competencies, training programs need to implement clinical, didactic, research, and professional development core guidelines grounded in cultural neuropsychology. We provide a framework on how to transform each core guideline, including a Didactics Core with foundational readings across a range of L/H topics, and a Report Template to guide the documentation of sociocultural information, language usage, normative data, and other relevant factors in a neuropsychological report.</ab>
        <ab>These cultural neuropsychology competencies and core guidelines need to become a basic core requirement for all neuropsychologists in training. With focused education in culturally based competencies, training programs can cultivate a sense of responsibility, inclusion, justice, and equity to train a generation of neuropsychologists, who intentionally and consistently practice socially responsible neuropsychology.</ab>

        <ab>Physician burnout has been described as more common among women than men. Even if there are no gender-based differences in prevalence, risk factors, such as work/home integration/conflict and gendered biases, likely differ. Prior administrations of an annual resident wellness survey at a single urban academic institution confirmed that rates of burnout were higher among women, especially during the PGY-2 year.</ab>
        <ab>A series of focus groups of PGY-3 women residents across specialties were organized in 2019 at a single urban academic medical center. Given the number of participants, demographics were not collected to maintain participant anonymity. The moderator for all groups used a discussion guide consisting of eight open-ended questions based on a review of the literature.</ab>
        <ab>Ten residents agreed to participate in one of four hour-long focus group discussions. While the residents identified some factors that were not gender-specific, they also discussed issues that they faced as women in medicine, including needing to work harder to prove themselves and unconscious gendered biases from faculty and patients. The residents thought that their well-being would be improved if their training programs better understood the experiences and needs of women residents and recommended a series of interventions, including improved mentoring and networking opportunities.</ab>
        <ab>Interventions to improve well-being need to consider gender-based differences. While mentoring and networking can help all residents, these may be especially useful for women and should be considered as a component of an overarching plan to improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.</ab>

        <ab>The inaugural Diversity and Inclusion in Science Session was held during the 2021 Society for Melanoma Research (SMR) congress. The goal of the session was to discuss diversity, equity, and inclusion in the melanoma research community and strategies to promote the advancement of underrepresented melanoma researchers. An international survey was conducted to assess the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate among researchers and clinicians within the Society for Melanoma Research (SMR). The findings suggest there are feelings and experiences of inequity, bias, and harassment within the melanoma community that correlate with one's gender, ethnic/racial group, and/or geographic location. Notably, significant reports of inequity in opportunity, discrimination, and sexual harassment demonstrate there is much work remaining to ensure all scientists in our community experience an academic workplace culture built on mutual respect, fair access, inclusion, and equitable opportunity.</ab>

        <ab>Quantitative survey.</ab>
        <ab>Academic otolaryngology departments.</ab>
        <ab>The DEI Inventory was developed by a multi-institutional health equity consortium and disseminated within 16 academic otolaryngology programs. The inventory consisted of 25 items graded on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree), 2 yes/no questions, and 5 items reflecting overall DEI, stress, and burnout among academic otolaryngologists. Validated imposter phenomenon and personality trait measures were also included.</ab>
        <ab>The inventory received 158 (31.0%) partial and 111 (21.8%) full responses. No significant differences were identified in DEI scores by race. Compared to males, females reported lower scores on the overall DEI Inventory (3.6 vs 4.3, p &lt; .001). Female respondents also reported greater levels of imposter phenomenon than their male counterparts (53.2 vs 47.5, p = .049).</ab>
        <ab>Preliminary responses to our DEI Inventory suggest that faculty perception of DEI is not impacted by race. Female faculty report considerably lower perceptions of DEI than their male counterparts and experience greater levels of imposter phenomenon. The results of the DEI Inventory can help departments design meaningful interventions to improve levels of DEI among faculty.</ab>

        <ab>Racial and ethnic disparities exist for many nervous system disorders that are intervention targets for neuromodulation investigators. Yet, to date, there has been both a lack of racial and ethnic diversity and a lack of emphasis on diversity in neuromodulation research. In this paper, we suggest three potential reasons for the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in neuromodulation research: 1) the lack of diversity in the neuromodulation workforce, 2) incompatibility between the technologies employed and phenotypic traits (e.g., hair texture) commonly present in minoritized populations, and 3) minoritized populations' reluctance to participate in clinical trials. We argue that increasing diversity in the neuromodulation workforce, in conjunction with mutual collaboration between current neuromodulation researchers and underrepresented communities in neuromodulation, can aid in removing barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuromodulation research. This is important, because greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuromodulation research brings with it the development of novel, yet safe and effective, treatment approaches for brain disorders and enhances the rigor and generalizability of discoveries in the field.</ab>

        <ab>Racism in emergency medicine healthcare research is pervasive but often underrecognized. In order to understand the current state of research on racism in emergency medicine healthcare research, we developed a consensus working group on this topic, which concluded a year of work with a consensus-building session as part of the overall Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Consensus Conference on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: "Developing a Research Agenda for Addressing Racism in Emergency Medicine," held on May 10, 2022. In this manuscript, we report the development, details of pre-conference methods and preliminary results, and the final consensus of the Healthcare Research Working Group. Preconference work based on literature review and expert opinion identified 13 potential priority research questions that were refined through an iterative process to a list of 10. During the conference, the subgroup used consensus methodology and a "consensus dollar" (contingent valuation) approach to prioritize research questions. The subgroup identified three research gaps: remedies for racial bias and systematic racism, biases and heuristics in clinical care, and racism in study design, and we derived a list of six high-priority research questions for our specialty.</ab>

        <ab>Informatics researchers and practitioners have started exploring racism related to the implementation and use of electronic health records (EHRs). While this work has begun to expose structural racism which is a fundamental driver of racial and ethnic disparities, there is a lack of inclusion of concepts of racism in this work. This perspective provides a classification of racism at 3 levels-individual, organizational, and structural-and offers recommendations for future research, practice, and policy. Our recommendations include the need to capture and use structural measures of social determinants of health to address structural racism, intersectionality as a theoretical framework for research, structural competency training, research on the role of prejudice and stereotyping in stigmatizing documentation in EHRs, and actions to increase the diversity of private sector informatics workforce and participation of minority scholars in specialty groups. Informaticians have an ethical and moral obligation to address racism, and private and public sector organizations have a transformative role in addressing equity and racism associated with EHR implementation and use.</ab>

        <ab>Research associated with digital health technologies similar to the technologies themselves has proliferated in the last 2 decades. There are calls for these technologies to provide cost-effective health care for underserved populations. However, the research community has also underserved many of these populations. Older Indigenous women are one such segment of the population.</ab>
        <ab>Our objective is to systematically review the literature to consolidate and document what we know about how older Indigenous women living in high-income countries use digital health technology to enhance their health.</ab>
        <ab>We analyzed the peer-reviewed literature by systematically searching 8 databases in March 2022. We included studies published between January 2006 and March 2022 with original data specific to older Indigenous women from high-income countries that reported on the effectiveness, acceptability, and usability of some user-focused digital health technology. We incorporated 2 measures of quality for each study. We also conducted a thematic analysis and a lived experience analysis, which examined each paper from the perspectives of older Indigenous women. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines in this study.</ab>
        <ab>Three papers met the inclusion criteria. The key findings were that older Indigenous women do not see themselves reflected in mainstream health messaging or other digital health offerings. They prefer an approach that considers their uniqueness and diversity. We also identified 2 significant gaps in the literature. First, research reporting on older Indigenous women from high-income countries' experiences with digital health technology is minimal. Second, the limited research related to older Indigenous women has not consistently engaged Indigenous people in the research process or governance.</ab>
        <ab>Older Indigenous women want digital health technologies to respond to their needs and preferences. Research is needed to understand their requirements and preferences to ensure equity as we move toward greater adoption of digital health technology. Engaging older Indigenous women throughout the research is essential to ensuring that digital health products and services are safe, usable, effective, and acceptable for older Indigenous women.</ab>

        <ab>Research consistently shows that non-scientific bias, equity, and diversity trainings do not work, and often make bias and diversity problems worse. Despite these widespread failures, there is considerable reason for hope that effective, meaningful DEI efforts can be developed. One approach in particular, the bias habit-breaking training, has 15 years of experimental evidence demonstrating its widespread effectiveness and efficacy.</ab>
        <ab>This article discusses bias, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts from the author's perspective as a scientist-practitioner - the author draws primarily on the scientific literature, but also integrates insights from practical experiences working in DEI. The author provides a roadmap for adapting effective, evidence-based approaches from other disciplines (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy) into the DEI context and reviews evidence related to the bias habit-breaking training as one prominent demonstration of a scientifically-validated approach that effects lasting, meaningful improvements on DEI issues within both individuals and institutions.</ab>
        <ab>DEI trainings fail due to widespread adoption of the information deficit model, which is well-known as a highly ineffective approach. Empowerment-based approaches, in contrast, are highly promising for making meaningful, lasting changes in the DEI realm. Evidence indicates that the bias habit-breaking training is effective at empowering individuals as agents of change to reduce bias, create inclusion, and promote equity, both within themselves and the social contexts they inhabit.</ab>
        <ab>In contrast to the considerable despair and pessimism around DEI efforts, the present analysis provides hope and optimism, and an empirically-validated path forward, to develop and test DEI approaches that empower individuals as agents of change.</ab>

        <ab>To determine the distribution of race and ethnicity among genitourinary oncology trial participants leading to FDA approval of novel molecular entities/biologics. Secondarily, we evaluated whether the proportion of Black participants in clinical trials increased over time. We quired the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Drug Trials Snapshot (DTS) between 2015 and 2020 for urologic oncology clinical trials leading to FDA approval of novel drugs. Enrollment data was stratified by race and ethnicity. Cochran-Armitage Trend tests were used to examine changes in Black patient participation over years. Nine clinical trials were identified that led to FDA approval of 5 novel molecular entities for prostate and 4 molecular entities for urothelial carcinoma treatment. Trials for prostate cancer included 5202 participants of which 69.8% were White, 4.0% Black, 11.0% Asian, 3.6% Hispanic, &lt;1% American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 3% other. Trials in urothelial carcinoma had 704 participants of which 75.1% were male, 80.8% White, 2.3% Black, 2.4% Hispanic, &lt;1% American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 5% other. Black participation rates over time did not change for urothelial (P = 0.59) or the combined cancer cohort (P = 0.29). Prostate cancer enrollment trends among Black participant declined over time (P = 0.03). Participants in genitourinary clinical trials leading to FDA approval of novel drugs are overwhelmingly white. Involving stakeholders who represent the needs and interests of underrepresented populations in the design and implementation of clinical trials of novel agents may be a strategy to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion among genitourinary clinical trials.</ab>

        <ab>Male researchers dominate scientific production in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, potential mechanisms to avoid this gender imbalance remain poorly explored in STEM, including ecology and evolution areas. In the last decades, changes in the peer-review process towards double-anonymized (DA) have increased among ecology and evolution (EcoEvo) journals. Using comprehensive data on articles from 18 selected EcoEvo journals with an impact factor &gt;1, we tested the effect of the DA peer-review process in female-leading ( i.e ., first and senior authors) articles. We tested whether the representation of female-leading authors differs between double and single-anonymized (SA) peer-reviewed journals. Also, we tested if the adoption of the DA by previous SA journals has increased the representativeness of female-leading authors over time. We found that publications led by female authors did not differ between DA and SA journals. Moreover, female-leading articles did not increase after changes from SA to DA peer-review. Tackling female underrepresentation in science is a complex task requiring many interventions. Still, our results highlight that adopting the DA peer-review system alone could be insufficient in fostering gender equality in EcoEvo scientific publications. Ecologists and evolutionists understand how diversity is important to ecosystems' resilience in facing environmental changes. The question remaining is: why is it so difficult to promote and keep this "diversity" in addition to equity and inclusion in the academic environment? We thus argue that all scientists, mentors, and research centers must be engaged in promoting solutions to gender bias by fostering diversity, inclusion, and affirmative measures.</ab>

        <ab>Grit refers to the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit has emerged as a recent topic of interest within the medical community. With ever-increasing rates of burnout and psychological distress, increasing attention has been directed towards modulatory or protective factors for these deleterious outcomes. Grit has been studied in regard to a variety of outcomes and variables in medicine. This article reviews the current literature on grit in medicine and summarises the current research on grit and performance metrics, personality characteristics, longitudinal progression, psychological well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, burnout and residency attrition. While there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of grit on performance metrics in medicine, research consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between grit and psychological well-being and a negative correlation between grit and burnout. After discussing some of the inherent limitations of this type of research, this article suggests some possible implications and future areas for research and their potential role in cultivating psychologically healthy physicians and promoting successful careers in medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Gender gaps persist in the 21st century, in many aspects of society and in many types of organisation. There are earnings gaps in almost all domains, reports of glass ceilings and the "missing middle" in business, finance, law and politics, and dramatic under-representation of women in many branches of science, even in the most "gender equal" countries. This is despite decades of effort to address them, including targeted legislation and many Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. Early essentialist, competence-based explanations for the existence of gender gaps have been largely discredited at the research level, although their persistence in the public consciousness and at the level of education and training can still negatively bias both individual self-belief and organisational processes. Contemporary essentialist explanations are now emerging, with claims that such gaps are the manifestations of the presence or absence of endogenous, brain-based characteristics underpinning career progression or career preferences. The focus remains on the individual as the source of gender imbalances. Less attention has been paid to the contextual aspects of organisations where gender gaps are evident, to inclusion (or the lack of it), or the availability of unbiased reward and progression pathways. Advances in 21st century social cognitive neuroscience are revealing the importance of external organisational processes as powerful brain-changing forces, with their potentially negative impact on self-belief and a sense of belonging. Key research is demonstrating the cortical and behavioural consequences of negative social experiences, with the activation of core inhibitory pathways associated with low self-esteem, lack of engagement, and eventual withdrawal. This paper will argue that reference to such research will provide better explanations for the persistence of gender gaps, and offer evidence-based insights into addressing gender gap issues. Importantly, this is not a rejection of an endogenous, brain-based explanation for gender gaps but the elaboration of a better-informed 21st century model, flagging up the need to take factors such as cultural stereotyping and organisational bias into account in any drive toward true gender equity, or genuinely levelled playing fields.</ab>

        <ab>ConspectusWe introduce the term discipline-based diversity research (DBDR) to capture the emerging field of research advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging with specificity to a given discipline. Contextualizing a human dynamic through a disciplinary lens has already given rise to discipline-based education research (DBER). The modalities through which students and practitioners think and process information are a reflection of a given discipline, and it tends to give rise to its professional practices. Through DBER, such specification is necessary in addressing evidence-based practices that are effective for teaching a particular subject. Likewise, the inequities and opportunities within a given field (and its professional culture) must be addressed within a disciplinary lens. Thus, the findings from social science in diversity in arbitrary contexts must be analyzed, interpreted, applied, and researched within a given discipline.One specific challenge to academic chemistry is the lack of inclusion in the sense that the faculties in research-active chemistry departments are far from diverse. We recapitulate the percentage of women and under-represented person of color (URPOC) professors over the past 20 years reported by us and other sources. The data admits to linear fits with high confidence. Assuming this linearity holds, the gender gap in representation would be bridged only in 2062, and the threshold of 20% of the faculty as URPOC would be reached only in 2113. While the community has actively engaged in modifying practices and procedures to redress this grim projection, it should be clear that more needs to be done.Toward this objective, we have been driven by the top-down hypothesis that solutions must be led intentionally through the top─that is, by department heads and chairs─because they are the stewards of the infrastructure. Department chairs and the chemistry community have engaged in DBDR through biennial workshops─that is, through the Open Chemistry Collaborative in Diversity Equity (OXIDE)'s National Diversity Equity Workshops (NDEWs)─to survey and evaluate existing policies and practices aimed at advancing inclusive excellence. This has led to research-based recommendations for the implementation of solutions in chemistry departments. This includes (i) engaging in community, (ii) conducting authentic and open searches, and (iii) recognizing and rewarding inclusive excellence. What makes them DBDR in chemistry is that we have to articulate and contextualize these solutions in terms of practices and procedures that we conduct in chemistry, assess their efficacy, and promote them across our discipline. Furthermore, we must offer theories of change for reforming them while offering frameworks that fit within how chemists think and practice.In this Account, we demonstrate how DBDR has taken root in chemistry, forecast where this emerging field may go, and provide a blueprint for how it might be replicated in other disciplines.</ab>

        <ab>According to recent census data, Hispanic and Latino populations comprise the largest minority group in the United States. Despite ongoing efforts for improved diversity, equity, and inclusion, Hispanics remain underrepresented in medicine (UIM). In addition to well-established benefits to patient care and health systems, physician diversity and increased representation in academic faculty positively impact the recruitment of trainees from UIM backgrounds. Disproportionate representation (as compared to increases of certain underrepresented groups in the US population) has direct implications for recruitment of UIM trainees to residency programs.</ab>
        <ab>To examine the number of full-time US medical school faculty physicians who self-identify as Hispanic in light of the increasing Hispanic population in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>We analyzed data from the Association of American Medical Colleges from 1990 to 2021, looking at those academic faculty who were classified as Hispanic, Latino, of Spanish Origin, or of Multiple Race-Hispanic. We used descriptive statistics and visualizations to illustrate the level of representation of Hispanic faculty by sex, rank, and clinical specialty over time.</ab>
        <ab>Overall, the proportion of faculty studied who identified as Hispanic increased from 3.1% (1990) to 6.01% (2021). Moreover, while the proportion of female Hispanic academic faculty increased, there remains a lag between females versus males.</ab>
        <ab>Our analysis shows that the number of full-time US medical school faculty who self-identify as Hispanic has not increased, though the population of Hispanics in the United States has increased.</ab>

        <ab>Education is an important step toward achieving equity in health care. However, there is little published literature examining the educational outcomes of curricula for resident physicians focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</ab>
        <ab>Our objective was to review the literature to assess the outcomes of curricula for resident physicians of all specialties focused on DEI in medical education and health care.</ab>
        <ab>We applied a structured approach to conducting a scoping review of the medical education literature. Studies were included for final analysis if they described a specific curricular intervention and educational outcomes. Outcomes were characterized using the Kirkpatrick Model.</ab>
        <ab>Nineteen studies were included for final analysis. Publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2021. Internal medicine residents were the most studied. The number of learners ranged from 10 to 181. The majority of studies were from a single program. Educational methods ranged from online modules to single workshops to multiyear longitudinal curricula. Eight studies reported Level 1 outcomes, 7 studies reported Level 2 outcomes, 3 studies reported Level 3 outcomes, and only 1 study measured changes in patient perceptions due to the curricular intervention.</ab>
        <ab>We found a small number of studies of curricular interventions for resident physicians that directly address DEI in medical education and health care. These interventions employed a wide array of educational methods, demonstrated feasibility, and were positively received by learners.</ab>

        <ab>The scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) should promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice for the next generation of psychologists.</ab>
        <ab>I worry that the SoTL propagates an exclusionary field that becomes increasingly irrelevant in our diverse society given that graduate curricula largely exclude scholarship on structural inequality.</ab>
        <ab>I detail the process of graduate curricular changes in my current department, with a focus on my new required graduate course, Diversity, Systems, and Inequality. I utilize scholarship from law, sociology, philosophy, women and gender studies, education, and psychology.</ab>
        <ab>I provide the structure and content of the course-including syllabi and lecture slides-as well as modes of assessment that promote inclusivity and critical thinking. I detail how current faculty can learn to incorporate the content of this work into their own teaching and scholarship through weekly journal clubs.</ab>
        <ab>SoTL outlets can publish transdisciplinary, inclusive course materials regarding structural inequality, thus mainstreaming and amplifying such work for the benefit of the field and our world.</ab>

        <ab>Pediatric departments and children's hospitals (hereafter pediatric academic settings) increasingly promote the tenets of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as guiding principles to shape the mission areas of clinical care, education, research, and advocacy. Integrating DEI across these domains has the potential to advance health equity and workforce diversity. Historically, initiatives toward DEI have been fragmented with efforts predominantly led by individual faculty or subgroups of faculty with little institutional investment or strategic guidance. In many instances, there is a lack of understanding or consensus regarding what constitutes DEI activities, who engages in DEI activities, how faculty feel about their engagement, and what is an appropriate level of support. Concerns also exist that DEI work falls disproportionately to racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in medicine, exacerbating what is termed the minority tax. Despite these concerns, current literature lacks quantitative data characterizing such efforts and their potential impact on the minority tax. As pediatric academic settings invest in DEI programs and leadership roles, there is imperative to develop and use tools that can survey faculty perspectives, assess efforts, and align DEI efforts between academic faculty and health systems. Our exploratory assessment among academic pediatric faculty demonstrates that much of the DEI work in pediatric academic settings is done by a small number of individuals, predominantly Black faculty, with limited institutional support or recognition. Future efforts should focus on expanding participation among all groups and increasing institutional engagement.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of skin of color and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) started to be recognized in the late 1990s. Since then, because of the advocacy and effort of several highly visible leaders in dermatology, noticeable progress has been achieved. Leadership lessons learned for successful implementation of DEI include the following: (1) commitment by and continued engagement of highly visible leaders; (2) engagement of other societies in dermatology; (3) engagement of dermatology department leaders and educators; (4) education of the next generation of dermatologists; (5) inclusivity in DEI to include gender and sexual orientation; and (6) cultivation of allies and allyship.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) increases performance through input of differing ideas and perspectives, leading to outcomes such as increased diagnostic accuracy, patient satisfaction, quality of care, and retention of talent. DEI can be difficult to establish due to the presence of unaddressed biases and ineffective policies against discrimination and noninclusive behaviors. Nevertheless, these complexities can be overcome through the integration of principles of DEI into the standard operations of health care, incentivizing DEI efforts through leadership curriculums, and highlighting the value proposition of diversifying our workforce as a critical asset to success.</ab>

        <ab>Research shows that a diverse faculty improves academic, clinical, and research outcomes in higher education. Despite that, persons in minority groups, usually categorized by race or ethnicity, are underrepresented in academia (URiA). The Nutrition Obesity Research Centers (NORCs), supported by the NIDDK, hosted workshops on five separate days in September and October 2020. NORCs convened these workshops to identify barriers and facilitators for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and provide specific recommendations to improve DEI within obesity and nutrition for individuals from URiA groups. Recognized experts on DEI presented each day, after which the NORCs conducted breakout sessions with key stakeholders who engage in nutrition and obesity research. The breakout session groups included early-career investigators, professional societies, and academic leadership. The consensus from the breakout sessions was that glaring inequities affect URiA in nutrition and obesity, particularly related to recruitment, retention, and advancement. Recommendations from the breakout sessions to improve DEI across the academe focused on six themes: (1) recruitment, (2) retention, (3) advancement, (4) intersectionality of multiple challenges (e.g., being Black and a woman), (5) funding agencies, and (6) implementation of strategies to address problems related to DEI.</ab>

        <ab>From the perspective of a Black woman in the biomechanics field, it is my observation that many Black biomechanists are exposed to the field of biomechanics late into their academic careers. STEM (science, technology, and mathematics) is such a broad/encompassing field, yet students are only typically given a narrow introduction to biology and chemistry prior to college. These basic science courses are not enough to continue recruiting and building a pathway for future scientists to pursue STEM careers in the interdisciplinary field of biomechanics. Outreach programs, like National Biomechanics Day (NBD), can expose students to biomechanics earlier than the usual undergraduate exposure for those majoring in health/exercise science, kinesiology, or biomedical/mechanical engineering. NBD has increased accessibility to biomechanics, which has led to increases in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomechanics community, particularly for young Black students. Outreach programs like NBD are crucial to reaching, engaging, and recruiting future young Black biomechanists, and others from underrepresented communities, within the US and beyond.</ab>

        <ab>Status epilepticus is one of the most frequent pediatric neurological emergencies. While etiology is often influencing the outcome, more easily modifiable risk factors of outcome include detection of prolonged convulsive seizures and status epilepticus and appropriately dosed and timely applied medication treatment. Unpredictability and delayed or incomplete treatment may at times lead to longer seizures, thereby affecting outcomes. Barriers in the care of acute seizures and status epilepticus include the identification of patients at greatest risk of convulsive status epilepticus, potential stigma, distrust, and uncertainties in acute seizure care, including caregivers, physicians, and patients. Furthermore, unpredictability, detection capability, and identification of acute seizures and status epilepticus, limitations in access to obtaining and maintaining appropriate treatment, and rescue treatment options pose challenges. Additionally, timing and dosing of treatment and related acute management algorithms, potential variations in care due to healthcare and physician culture and preference, and factors related to access, equity, diversity, and inclusion of care. We outline strategies for the identification of patients at risk of acute seizures and status epilepticus, improved status epilepticus detection and prediction, and acute closed-loop treatment and status epilepticus prevention. This paper was presented at the 8th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures held in September 2022.</ab>

        <ab>Political momentum for antiracist policies grew out of the collective trauma highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This prompted discussions of root cause analyses for differences in health outcomes among historically underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minorities. Dismantling structural racism in medicine is an ambitious goal that requires widespread buy-in and transdisciplinary collaborations across institutions to establish systematic, rigorous approaches that enable sustainable change. Radiology is at the center of medical care and renewed focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) provides an opportune window for radiologists to facilitate an open forum to address racialized medicine to catalyze real and lasting change. The framework of change management can help radiology practices create and maintain this change while minimizing disruption. This article discusses how change management principles can be leveraged by radiology to lead EDI interventions that will encourage honest dialogue, serve as a platform to support institutional EDI efforts, and lead to systemic change.</ab>

        <ab>Currently, the increasing diversity of our society is poorly reflected in the urology workforce. In this review, we sought to address this disparity by highlighting key components involved in forming an academic urology department and training program that is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as well as recruitment and retention of underrepresented in medicine (URiM) trainees and faculty.</ab>
        <ab>We identified obstacles and provided approaches to enhance the ability of a department in creating a DEI-based curriculum and recruitment strategy with a key focus on understanding and addressing unconscious biases and microaggressions in the workplace. Substantive changes in the level of diversity within the urologic community can be made through the organization of a structured approach to increasing DEI. It starts with a commitment from each department to form achievable goals surrounding early mentorship of URiM students and trainees, an inclusive curriculum that is rooted in DEI, and targeted benchmarks for recruitment and retention of diverse staff.</ab>

        <ab>Precision medicine emerged as a promising approach to identify suitable interventions for individual patients with a particular health concern and at various time points. Technology can enable the acquisition of increasing volumes of clinical and "omics" data at the individual and population levels and support advanced clinical decision making. However, to keep pace with evolving societal realities and developments, it is important to systematically include sex- and gender-specific considerations in the research process, from the acquisition of knowledge to implementation. Building on the foundations of evidence-based medicine and existing precision medicine frameworks, we propose a novel evidence-based precision medicine framework in the form of the P3 2 model, which considers individual sex-related (predictive [P1], preventive [P2], and personalized [P3] medicine) and gender-related (participatory [P4], psychosocial [P5], and percipient [P6] medicine) domains and their intersection with ethnicity, geography, and other demographic and social variables, in addition to population, community, and public dimensions (population-informed [P7], partnered with community [P8], and public-engaging [P9] medicine, respectively). Through its ability to contextualize and reflect on societal realities and developments, our model is expected to promote consideration of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles and, thus, enrich science, increase reproducibility of research, and ensure its social impact.</ab>

        <ab>Recruiting a diverse group of medical students, house officers, and faculty in medicine is challenging-particularly for predominantly white, midwest institutions that may not be racially or ethnically diverse.</ab>
        <ab>To evaluate a novel clinical simulation program, SiMfest, for recruiting house officers from historically marginalized populations to our institution to demonstrate our leadership's commitment to high-quality education and recruitment of these students to enhance diversity in academic medicine.</ab>
        <ab>The Office for Health Equity and Inclusion, institutional leadership, and clinical department chairs developed a novel and engaging series of clinical simulations, SiMfest, to engage the pipeline of historically marginalized trainees and demonstrate our leadership's commitment to high-quality education. SiMfest is a two-hour simulation session presented annually (2017-2019) by our institution at the Student National Medical Association Annual Medical Education Conference.</ab>
        <ab>Over 800 students participated in SiMfest sessions over three years. Of the 461 participants who completed a survey after participation, 301 identified as female, and 382 indicated a racial category considered as historically marginalized in medicine-91% of whom identified as African American or Black. Thirty percent (n = 125) of respondents identified as pre-medical (e.g., undergraduate, post-baccalaureate) students and 69% (n = 289) identified as current medical students. Over 80% of students would recommend SiMfest to others. Additionally, 73% (n = 87) of pre-medical and 54% (n = 143) of medical students reported exposure to a previously unknown specialty. Thirty-three department representatives reported their SiMfest experience revealed new information about historically marginalized applicants that they may not have engaged with through the traditional application process but would be more likely to engage with in future diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</ab>
        <ab>SiMfest harnessed our institution's high-quality training, personnel resources, and diversity, equity, and inclusion values to bring historically marginalized students in medicine and department leadership together to learn about one another and offer experiential learning. SiMfest may serve as a model for other institutions to draw on their strengths to develop innovative recruitment programs that promote the education and engagement of undergraduate and medical students from historically marginalized populations while simultaneously promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion culture change.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. To explore the experience of members of Arab American Pharmacy Educators (AAPE) regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workplace. Methods. A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed electronically to 51 AAPE members. Eligible participants were those who identify with Arab heritage and have worked at US schools or colleges of pharmacy. Following the initial invitation, three reminders were sent to complete the questionnaire. Results. A total of 31 (61% response rate) AAPE members completed the questionnaire. The majority of participants reported an overall positive academic experience. However, some participants reported being subject to negative stereotypes and discrimination, which may have hindered their ability to teach, practice, conduct research, and fully engage in service to their schools or colleges, profession, and community. Conclusion. Some AAPE members reported negative stereotypes and discrimination at US schools or colleges of pharmacy. Findings from this study can have implications for faculty representing different minority groups, especially for those pharmacy educators who are not of Western European descent and anyone who is perceived as the "other."</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to examine the diversity, equity, and inclusion landscape in academic trauma surgery and the EAST organization.</ab>
        <ab>In 2019, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) surveyed its members on equity and inclusion in the #EAST4ALL survey and assessed leadership representation. We hypothesized that women and surgeons of color (SOC) are underrepresented as EAST members and leaders.</ab>
        <ab>Survey responses were analyzed post-hoc for representation of females and SOC in academic appointments and leadership, EAST committees, and the EAST board, and compared to the overall respondent cohort. EAST membership and board demographics were compared to demographic data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.</ab>
        <ab>Of 306 respondents, 37.4% identified as female and 23.5% as SOC. There were no significant differences in female and SOC representation in academic appointments and EAST committees compared to their male and white counterparts. In academic leadership, females were underrepresented ( P &lt; 0.0001), whereas SOC were not ( P = 0.08). Both females and SOC were underrepresented in EAST board membership ( P = 0.002 and P = 0.043, respectively). Of EAST's 33 presidents, 3 have been white women (9%), 2 have been Black, non-African American men (6%), and 28 (85%) have been white men. When compared to 2017 AAMC data, women are well-represented in EAST's 2020 membership ( P &lt; 0.0001) and proportionally represented on EAST's 2019-2020 board ( P &gt; 0.05).</ab>
        <ab>The #EAST4ALL survey suggests that women and SOC may be underrepresented as leaders in academic trauma surgery. However, lack of high-quality demographic data makes evaluating representation of structurally marginalized groups challenging. National trauma organizations should elicit data from their members to re-assess and promote the diversity landscape in trauma surgery.</ab>
        <ab>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</ab>

        <ab>Genetic counselors strive to provide high-quality genetic services. To do so, it is essential to define quality in genetic counseling and identify opportunities for improvement. This Professional Issues article provides an overview of the evaluation of healthcare quality in genetic counseling. The National Society of Genetic Counselors' Research, Quality, and Outcomes Committee partnered with Discern Health, a value-based healthcare policy consulting firm, to develop a care continuum model of genetic counseling. Using the proposed model, currently available quality measures relevant to genetic counseling in the US healthcare system were assessed, allowing for the identification of gaps and priority areas for further development. A total of 560 quality measures were identified that can be applied to various aspects of the care continuum model across a range of clinical specialty areas in genetic counseling, although few measures were specific to genetic counseling or genetic conditions. Areas where quality measures were lacking included: attitudes toward genetic testing, family communication, stigma, and issues of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We discuss these findings and other strategies for an evidence-based approach to quality in genetic counseling. Strategic directions for the genetic counseling profession should include a consolidated approach to research on quality and value of genetic counseling, development of quality metrics and patient-experience measures, and engagement with other improvement activities. These strategies will allow for benchmarking, performance improvement, and future implementation in accountability programs which will strengthen genetic counseling as a profession that provides evidence-based high-quality care to all patients.</ab>

        <ab>To describe the perception of professional climate in health services and policy research (HSPR) and efforts to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the HSPR workforce and workplaces.</ab>
        <ab>We administered the HSPR Workplace Culture Survey online to health services and policy researchers.</ab>
        <ab>Our survey examined participants' sociodemographic, educational, and professional backgrounds, their perception on DEI in HSPR, experience with DEI initiatives, feeling of inclusion, and direct and witnessed experiences of discrimination at their institutions/organizations. We calculated sample proportions of responses by gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability status and compared them with Fisher's exact test.</ab>
        <ab>We administered the survey online from July 28 to September 4, 2020. HSPR professionals and trainees aged 18 and older were eligible to participate. Analyses used complete cases only (n = 906; 70.6% completion rate).</ab>
        <ab>53.4% of the participants did not believe that the current workforce reflects the diversity of communities impacted by HSPR. Although most participants have witnessed various DEI initiatives at their institutions/organizations, nearly 40% characterized these initiatives as "tokenistic." Larger proportions of participants who identified as female, LGBQI+, underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and those with a disability held this perception than their male, heterosexual, White, and non-disabled counterparts. Current DEI initiatives focused on "planning" activities (e.g., convening task forces) rather than "implementation" activities (e.g., establishing mentoring or network programs). 43.7% of the participants felt supported on their career development, while female, Black, Hispanic/Latino, LGBQI+ participants and those with a disability experienced discrimination at their workplace.</ab>
        <ab>Despite an increasing commitment to increasing the diversity of the HSPR workforce and improving equity and inclusion in the HSPR workplace, our results suggest that there is more work to be done to achieve such goals.</ab>

        <ab>Discrimination negatively impacts physician career trajectories and well-being.</ab>
        <ab>Quantify perceived religious discrimination among US Muslim physicians and compare trends over time.</ab>
        <ab>Two national surveys tabulated discrimination. The 2013 survey involved a mailed questionnaire to a random sample of 746 Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA) members, while the 2021 survey was administered online to subscribers of IMANA, American Muslim Health Professionals, and the US Muslim Physician network. Eligible participants had to be practicing US Muslim physicians, and English-proficient (the 2021 sample was further restricted to physicians in academic medicine). Questionnaires assessed experiences of religious discrimination and accommodation.</ab>
        <ab>In 2013, the 255 participants had a mean age of 52 years, were mostly male (70%), Sunni (91%), South Asian (70%), and adult immigrants (65%). In 2021, the 264 participants had a mean age of 39.5 years, were mostly male (65%) and Sunni (75%). In contrast to 2013, the majority were born in the USA (59%; p&lt;0.01), and respondents were more diverse with 33% South Asians, 22% Arabs, and 16% African Americans. Greater proportions of the 2021 sample reported facing religious discrimination frequently in their career (24 to 53%; p&lt;0.01), experiencing job turnover (7 to 32%; p&lt;0.01), and having patients refuse their care (9 to 33%; p&lt;0.01). A higher proportion of South Asians, Arabs, and participants under the age of 40 reported discrimination and job turnover in 2021 when compared to 2013. Higher proportions of South Asians and Whites reported being passed over for professional advancement and having patients refuse their care in 2021 relative to 2013.</ab>
        <ab>Many American Muslim clinicians encounter religious discrimination at the workplace, and these experiences appear to be on the rise. Healthcare workforce diversity, inclusion, and equity programming should include a focus on accommodating the religious identities of physicians.</ab>

        <ab>Orthopaedic surgery is the least-diverse surgical specialty based on race and ethnicity. To our knowledge, the impact of this lack of diversity on discriminatory or noninclusive experiences perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during their residency training has never been evaluated. Racial microaggressions were first defined in the 1970s as "subtle verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group." Although the term "microaggression" has long been established, more recently, as more workplaces aim to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion, it has entered the medical profession's lexicon as a means of describing the spectrum of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in the healthcare environment.</ab>
        <ab>(1) What is the extent of discrimination that is perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during residency? (2) What subtypes of racial microaggressions (which encompasses racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion) do Black orthopaedic surgeons experience during residency training, and who are the most common initiators of these microaggressions? (3) What feedback statements could be perceived as racially biased to Black orthopaedic surgeons in residency training? (4) Are there gender differences in the reported types of racial microaggressions recalled by Black respondents during residency training?</ab>
        <ab>An anonymous survey was administered between July 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020, to practicing orthopaedic surgeons, residents, and fellows in the J. Robert Gladden Orthopaedic Society database who self-identify as Black. There were 455 Black orthopaedic surgeons in practice and 140 Black orthopaedic residents or fellows in the database who met these criteria. Fifty-two percent (310 of 595) of participants responded. Fifty-three percent (243 of 455) were practicing surgeons and 48% (67 of 140) were current residents or fellows. Respondents reported their perception of discrimination in the residency workplace using a modified version of the single-item Perceived Occupational Discrimination Scale and were asked to recall any specific examples of experiences with racial discrimination, bias, or exclusion during their training. Examples were later categorized as different subtypes of racial microaggressions and were quantified through a descriptive analysis and compared by gender.</ab>
        <ab>Among survey respondents, 34% (106 of 310) perceived a lot of residency workplace discrimination, 44% (137 of 310) perceived some residency workplace discrimination, 18% (55 of 310) perceived a little residency workplace discrimination, and 4% (12 of 310) perceived no residency workplace discrimination. Categorized examples of racial microaggressions experienced in residency were commonly reported, including being confused for a nonphysician medical staff (nurse or physician's assistant) by 87% (271 of 310) of respondents or nonmedical staff (janitorial or dietary services) by 81% (250 of 310) of respondents. Racially explicit statements received during residency training were reported by 61% (190 of 310) of respondents. Thirty-eight percent (117 of 310) of such statements were reportedly made by patients and 18% (55 of 310) were reportedly made by attending faculty. Fifty percent (155 of 310) of respondents reported receiving at least one of nine potentially exclusionary or devaluing feedback statements during their residency training. Among those respondents, 87% (135 of 155) perceived at least one of the statements to be racially biased in its context. The three feedback statements that, when received, were most frequently perceived as racially biased in their context was that the respondent "matched at their program to fulfill a diversity quota" (94% [34 of 36]), the respondent was unfriendly compared with their peers (92% [24 of 26]), or that the respondent was "intimidating or makes those around him/her uncomfortable" (88% [51 of 58]). When compared by gender, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken for janitors and dietary services at 97% (63 of 65), compared with Black men at 77% (187 of 244; p &lt; 0.01). In addition, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken as nurses or physician assistants (100% [65 of 65]) than Black men did (84% [205 of 244]) during orthopaedic residency training (p &lt; 0.01). Black women also more frequently reported receiving potentially devaluing or exclusionary feedback statements during residency training.</ab>
        <ab>Perception of workplace discrimination during orthopaedic residency training is high (96%) among Black orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. Most respondents reported experiencing discrimination, bias, and exclusion that could be categorized as specific subtypes of racial microaggressions. Several different examples of racial microaggressions were more commonly reported by Black women. Certain feedback statements were frequently perceived as racially biased by recipients.</ab>
        <ab>To better understand barriers to the successful recruitment and retention of Black physicians in orthopaedics, the extent of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in residency training must be quantified. This study demonstrates that racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion during residency, wholly categorized as racial microaggressions, are frequently recalled by Black orthopaedic surgeons. A better understanding of the context of these experiences of Black trainees is a necessary starting point for the development of a more inclusive workplace training environment in orthopaedic surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical trial participants do not reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of people with cancer. ASCO and the Association of Community Cancer Centers collaborated on a quality improvement study to enhance racial and ethnic equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in cancer clinical trials. The groups conducted a pilot study to examine the feasibility, utility, and face validity of a two-part clinical trial site self-assessment to enable diverse types of research sites in the United States to (1) review internal data to assess racial and ethnic disparities in screening and enrollment and (2) review their policies, programs, procedures to identify opportunities and strategies to improve EDI. Overall, 81% of 62 participating sites were satisfied with the assessment; 82% identified opportunities for improvement; and 63% identified specific strategies and 74% thought the assessment had potential to help their site increase EDI. The assessment increased awareness about performance (82%) and helped identify specific strategies (63%) to increase EDI in trials. Although most sites (65%) were able to provide some data on the number of patients that consented, only two sites were able to provide all requested trial screening, offering, and enrollment data by race and ethnicity. Documenting and evaluating such data are critical steps toward improving EDI and are key to identifying and addressing disparities more broadly. ASCO and Association of Community Cancer Centers will partner with sites to better understand their processes and the feasibility of collecting screening, offering, and enrollment data in systematic and automated ways.</ab>

        <ab>Gender inequity is a critical diversity, equity, and inclusion issue that has continued to lead to workplace disparities. While gender-based differences in pay are well documented, there are multiple other facets of academic worklife (eg, teaching, research, service, resources, etc) wherein gender inequities exist but have never been systematically identified or reported. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these inequities. One reason for continued existence of gender disparities in the workplace is lack of focused attention and emphasis on this issue. A recently formed Gender Equity Task Force has taken the first steps to systematically explore gender inequity in all areas of academic pharmacy worklife. The purpose of this Commentary is to highlight the scope of the problem of gender inequity in pharmacy academia and offer solutions that the Academy can implement to mitigate the impact of gender inequity in the future.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this study was to determine the demographics and perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the field of dermatopathology to provide a measurable baseline for future efforts to enhance equity measures within our subspecialty.</ab>
        <ab>A questionnaire based on a previously validated instrument by Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) was sent to American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) members to collect the demographic information (gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, experience and practice setting, etc.) and evaluate eight diversity, engagement, and inclusivity statements on a 1-5 Likert scale.</ab>
        <ab>The demographics of 207 of 1331 (15%) respondents showed slight male predominance. Eleven percent of respondents identified as LGBTQI. The major racial distribution was comprised of 62% White, 18% Asian (including Middle Eastern/Indian), 10% Hispanic, and 4% Black respondents. New-in-practice respondents (those in practice-5 years or less) were more likely to have a pathology background (71% vs. 56%, p = 0.047) than their more-established peers with more than 5 years of service. This trend also contributed to increased diversity in terms of gender (66% females) and race (48% non-White) among the newer generation. Dermatology-trained dermatopathologists were mostly White (70%) and male (53%). Analysis of respondent demographics with perception statements showed that White and US graduate respondents (compared to other groups) were more likely to have a positive perception about DEI within the field of dermatopathology.</ab>
        <ab>The results provide a snapshot of the current state of diversity within the field of dermatopathology. Moreover, these results highlight opportunities for further increasing diversity in general and leadership in particular within dermatopathology.</ab>

        <ab>This paper is a critical essay to discuss an original methodological design for an equity school evaluation in diverse-by-design schools. The evaluation was to gather a broad swathe of data necessary to provide detailed insights on diverse-by-design schools in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. We chronicle and critically explore the methodological pivots generated by the research team as we conducted this research against the backdrop of both the COVID-19 pandemic and US nationwide protests in response to the murder of George Floyd and countless other Black people at the hands of the police. We challenge our own use of equity in our research design by centering school communities through agency of partnership.</ab>

        <ab>Objective. To provide a review of best practices for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committees at United States colleges of pharmacy. Findings. In colleges of pharmacy, DEI committees can play a crucial role in promoting a culture change to ensure pharmacy graduates are equipped to provide equitable and representative care for the patients they serve. There is limited literature available on DEI committee composition, roles, and responsibilities, and their place within a college of pharmacy's organizational structure. A commitment to DEI should be part of the college's strategic plan and embedded and supported at all levels of the college and university to ensure success of DEI-related strategic initiatives. For a DEI committee to be effective, its composition should be intentional to include change agents, campus leaders, and members who are passionate and knowledgeable to execute the DEI goals. For sustainable change, involvement of the entire learning community and an organizational culture change is also important. Thus, DEI committees need to establish active bidirectional collaborations and communication with all key committees, offices, community leaders, and alumni to implement diversity goals. Summary. The DEI committee's established place in the organizational structure of the college is essential to ensure fair and appropriate representation of the community it serves. A clearly defined DEI committee with committee composition, roles, responsibilities, and its association with all constituents of the college and community can help achieve its intended strategic goals.</ab>

        <ab>There have been increasing calls for awareness and action related to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in simulation but a lack of practical guidance for how simulation delivery teams (SDTs) might move towards meaningful transformation. The gap between academic conversations about EDI and how to practically impact SDT attitudes, behaviors, and performance remains considerable. We designed a conversational tool, the SIM-EDI, to bridge the gap between theory and practice for SDTs by enhancing reflexivity and studied its impact locally.</ab>
        <ab>We engaged in a collaborative autoethnography to explore EDI within our emergency department SDT shortly after implementing the SIM-EDI. The 12-month ethnography is informed by our team's collection and analysis of data about ourselves and our own experiences using the tool. Data included serial interviews, field notes from simulations and SDT meetings, SDT documents, and self-reflections.</ab>
        <ab>We found the SIM-EDI tool could be implemented with a team with a high level of readiness. Use of the tool had several meaningful impacts including enhanced team reflexivity, normalization of conversations related to EDI and increased confidence to engage in EDI conversations with participants. Key themes throughout the process included (1) individual and team growth, (2) fear of "getting it wrong", and (3) tension between bias towards action and need for slow reflection.</ab>
        <ab>The SIM-EDI tool can effectively promote reflexivity among faculty in an emergency department simulation program. The tool is easy to use and implement, impacts attitudes and behaviors, and facilitates individual and team growth.</ab>

        <ab>We argue that gerontologists are products of our ageist culture and that we both perpetuate ageism and suffer from internalized ageism ourselves. We make ageist comments, deny our own age, fail to teach students to recognize and confront ageism, and use language that otherizes and categorizes older people. Gerontologists are in ideal positions to confront ageism through our scholarly work, teaching, and community engagement. However, we suggest that, despite our deep gerontological knowledge, we do not have enough awareness, knowledge, and skills for taking anti-ageism actions in these arenas of our professional lives. We offer some suggestions for confronting ageism, including self-study, increasing content on ageism in the classroom and beyond, pointing out ageist language and behaviors to colleagues and students, working with diversity, equity and inclusion offices on campus, and giving careful consideration to our research approaches and academic writing. To go forward, we must increase awareness about ageism and gain skills in promoting anti-ageism.</ab>

        <ab>Women and underrepresented in medicine applicants value climate for diversity when selecting graduate medical education training programs. Climate may not be accurately represented during virtual recruitment. Optimizing program websites may help overcome this barrier. We reviewed websites for adult infectious disease (ID) fellowships that participated in the 2022 National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) Match for emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Fewer than half expressed DEI language in their mission statement or had a dedicated DEI statement or webpage. Programs should consider emphasizing their commitment to DEI prominently on their websites, which may help recruit candidates from diverse backgrounds.</ab>

        <ab>Racism has not only contributed to disparities in healthcare outcomes, but has also negatively impacted the recruitment, retention, and promotion of historically excluded groups in academic medicine. The 2022 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) consensus conference, "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Developing a Research Agenda for Addressing Racism in Emergency Medicine," convened a diverse group of researchers, healthcare providers , educators, administrative leaders, and healthcare providers to help address the impact of racism in three domains in academic emergency medicine: clinical research, education and training, and academic leadership. The main goals of the consensus process were to identify current knowledge gaps and create a research agenda within each domain using an iterative consensus-building methodology. 90 SAEM members representing faculty and trainees participated in breakout groups in each domain to generate consensus recommendations for priority research. For clinical research, 3 research gaps with 6 questions (N) were identified: remedies for bias and systematic racism (3), biases and heuristics in clinical care (2), and racism in study design (1). For education and training, 3 research gaps with 7 questions were identified: curriculum and assessment (2), recruitment (1), and learning environment (4). For academic leadership, 3 research gaps with 5 questions were identified: understanding the current DEI landscape and culture (1), analyzing programs that improve DEI and identifying factors that lead to improved diversity (3), and quantifying the value of professional stewardship activities (1). This article reports the results of the consensus conference with the goal of influencing emergency care research, education, and policy, and facilitating collaborations, grant funding, and publications in these domains.</ab>

        <ab>Latin America is one of the regions with the most significant inequalities in women's health as a result of factors such as social disparity, lack of work opportunities, unemployment, violence, and corruption. Adding a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic to these elements created a perfect storm that perpetuated extreme inequalities. The crisis negatively impacted Latin-American women, and economic recession in our region was one of the main consequences, resulting in women compared with men having higher rates of poverty, poorer access to and experience of healthcare, a wider gender gap, and adverse effects on well-being. This consequently made women more vulnerable. Several initiatives to allow better access and to provide safe anesthesia to pregnant patients have been taken in the region to improve obstetric patient care during the pandemic and beyond. Education has been pivotal and one of the most essential tools in bridging the gap in inequalities between men and women.</ab>

        <ab>The CanMEDS physician competency framework will be updated in 2025. The revision occurs during a time of disruption and transformation to society, healthcare, and medical education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and growing acknowledgement of the impacts of colonialism, systemic discrimination, climate change, and emerging technologies on healthcare and training. To inform this revision, we sought to identify emerging concepts in the literature related to physician competencies.</ab>
        <ab>Emerging concepts were defined as ideas discussed in the literature related to the roles and competencies of physicians that are absent or underrepresented in the 2015 CanMEDS framework. We conducted a literature scan, title and abstract review, and thematic analysis to identify emerging concepts. Metadata for all articles published in five medical education journals between October 1, 2018 and October 1, 2021 were extracted. Fifteen authors performed a title and abstract review to identify and label underrepresented concepts. Two authors thematically analyzed the results to identify emerging concepts. A member check was conducted.</ab>
        <ab>1017 of 4973 (20.5%) of the included articles discussed an emerging concept. The thematic analysis identified ten themes: Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice; Anti-racism; Physician Humanism; Data-Informed Medicine; Complex Adaptive Systems; Clinical Learning Environment; Virtual Care; Clinical Reasoning; Adaptive Expertise; and Planetary Health. All themes were endorsed by the authorship team as emerging concepts.</ab>
        <ab>This literature scan identified ten emerging concepts to inform the 2025 revision of the CanMEDS physician competency framework. Open publication of this work will promote greater transparency in the revision process and support an ongoing dialogue on physician competence. Writing groups have been recruited to elaborate on each of the emerging concepts and how they could be further incorporated into CanMEDS 2025.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in trauma and acute care surgery (ACS) has become increasingly apparent in the field of medicine. Despite the growing diversity of the patient population, the surgical specialty has traditionally been dominated by white males. This involves increasing the representation of diverse individuals in leadership positions, professional societies, scholarships, graduate education, and practicing physicians. This opinion piece aims to address the gaps in the literature regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in trauma and acute care surgery and highlight the issues related to the workforce, gender gap, patient outcomes, and health services. To effectively guide DEI interventions, it is essential to capture patient-reported experience data and stratify outcomes by factors including race, ethnicity, ancestry, language, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Only then can generalizable findings effectively inform DEI strategies. Using validated measurement tools, it is essential to conduct these assessments with methodological rigor. Collaboration between healthcare institutions can also provide valuable insights into effective and ineffective intervention practices through information exchange and constructive feedback. These recommendations aim to address the multifactorial nature of healthcare inequities in trauma and ACS. However, successful DEI interventions require a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving observed disparities, necessitating further research.</ab>

        <ab>In the past decade, there have been dramatic changes in all aspects of neurologic care, and along with this, neurology education has transformed. These changes have affected all aspects of education across the educational continuum, including learners, teachers, educators, content, delivery methods, assessments, and outcomes. Health systems science, health humanities, diversity, equity, and inclusion and health disparities are becoming core components of neurology curricula, and, in the future, will be integrated into every aspect of our educational mission. The ways in which material is taught and learned have been influenced by technologic innovations and a growing understanding of the science of learning. We forecast that this trend will continue, with learners choosing from an array of electronic resources to engage with fundamental topics, allowing front-line clinical teachers to spend more time supporting critical reasoning and teaching students how to learn. There has been a growing differentiation of educational roles (i.e., teachers, educators, and scholars). We forecast that these roles will become more distinct, each with an individualized pattern of support and expectations. Assessment has become more aligned with the work of the learners, and there are growing calls to focus more on the impact of educational programs on patient care. We forecast that there will be an increased emphasis on educational outcomes and public accountability for training programs. In this article, we reflect on the history of medical education in neurology and explore the current state to forecast the future of neurology education and discuss ways in which we can prepare.</ab>

        <ab>Representation of humans from diverse backgrounds in the drug development process is key to advancing health equity, and while clinical trial design has recently made strides toward greater inclusivity, preclinical drug development has struggled to make those same gains. One barrier to inclusion is the current lack of robust and established in vitro model systems that simultaneously capture the complexity of human tissues while representing patient diversity. Here, the use of primary human intestinal organoids as a mechanism to advance inclusive preclinical research is proposed. This in vitro model system not only recapitulates tissue functions and disease states, but also retains the genetic identity and epigenetic signatures of the donors from which they are derived. Thus, intestinal organoids are an ideal in vitro prototype for capturing human diversity. In this perspective, the authors call for an industry-wide effort to leverage intestinal organoids as a starting point to actively and intentionally incorporate diversity into preclinical drug programs.</ab>

        <ab>Community-based conservation can support livelihoods and biodiversity, while reinforcing local and Indigenous values, cultures, and institutions. Its delivery can help address cross-cutting global challenges, such as climate change, conservation, poverty, and food security. Therefore, understanding trends in community-based conservation is pertinent to setting and implementing global goals. We undertook a horizon scan to prioritize 15 emerging threats and opportunities expected to impact the future effectiveness of community-based conservation. Topics relate to global biodiversity policy; human rights; shifting human geography; inclusion, diversity, equity, and access; conservation finance and income; and economic reforms. Our findings offer guidance on strengthening community-based conservation to achieve global environmental and development goals.</ab>

        <ab>The number of surgical residents experiencing childbearing during residency training is increasing, and there is an absence of clarity with respect to parental-leave, lactation and return-to-work policies in support of residents. The aim of this review was to examine parental-leave policies during residency training in surgery and the perceptions of these policies by residents, program directors and coresidents, as described in the literature.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a scoping review of the literature based on the following themes: maternity or parental-leave policies; antepartum work-restriction policies and obstetric complications; accommodations for training absences; support for, and perceptions of, maternity or parental leave during residency training; and challenges upon return to work, namely resident performance and breastfeeding.</ab>
        <ab>Parental-leave policies during surgical residency training have historically lacked clarity and enforcement. Although recommendations for parental leave are now in place, this may have historically contributed to a lack of perceived support for surgical residents and may result in variable leave permitted to residents. Unclear policies may also contribute to career dissatisfaction among resident parents, which may deter qualified individuals from selecting surgical subspecialties.</ab>
        <ab>A call for a cultural shift is required to inform policies that would better support residents across all surgical specialties to pursue success in their dual roles as parents and surgeons. With increased awareness, progress in policy and guideline development is under way.</ab>

        <ab>Natural resource governance is inherently complex owing to the socio-ecological systems in which it is embedded. Working arrangements have been fundamentally transformed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with potential negative impacts on trust-based social networks foundational to resource management and transboundary governance. To inform development of a post-pandemic new-normal in resource management, we examined trust relationships using the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America as a case study. 82.9% (n = 97/117) of Great Lakes fishery managers and scientists surveyed indicated that virtual engagement was effective for maintaining well-established relationships during the pandemic; however, 76.7% (n = 89/116) of respondents indicated in-person engagement to be more effective than virtual engagement for building and maintaining trust. Despite some shortcomings, virtual or remote engagement presents opportunities, such as: (1) care and nurturing of well-established long-term relationships; (2) short-term (1-3 years) trust maintenance; (3) peer-peer or mentor-mentee coordination; (4) supplemental communications; (5) producer-push knowledge dissemination; and, if done thoughtfully, (6) enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Without change, pre-pandemic trust-based relationships foundational to cooperative, multinational, resource management are under threat.</ab>

        <ab>Partnering with consumers in the planning, delivery and evaluation of health services is an essential component of person-centred care. There are many ways to partner with consumers to improve health services, including formal group partnerships (such as committees, boards or steering groups). However, consumers' and health providers' views and experiences of formal group partnerships remain unclear. In this qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), we focus specifically on formal group partnerships where health providers and consumers share decision-making about planning, delivering and/or evaluating health services. Formal group partnerships were selected because they are widely used throughout the world to improve person-centred care. For the purposes of this QES, the term 'consumer' refers to a person who is a patient, carer or community member who brings their perspective to health service partnerships. 'Health provider' refers to a person with a health policy, management, administrative or clinical role who participates in formal partnerships in an advisory or representative capacity. This QES was co-produced with a Stakeholder Panel of consumers and health providers. The QES was undertaken concurrently with a Cochrane intervention review entitled Effects of consumers and health providers working in partnership on health services planning, delivery and evaluation.</ab>
        <ab>1. To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of formal partnership approaches that aimed to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. 2. To identify best practice principles for formal partnership approaches in health services by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences.</ab>
        <ab>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and October 2018. We also searched grey literature sources including websites of relevant research and policy organisations involved in promoting person-centred care.</ab>
        <ab>We included qualitative studies that explored consumers' and health providers' perceptions and experiences of partnering in formal group formats to improve the planning, delivery or evaluation of health services.</ab>
        <ab>Following completion of abstract and full-text screening, we used purposive sampling to select a sample of eligible studies that covered a range of pre-defined criteria, including rich data, range of countries and country income level, settings, participants, and types of partnership activities. A Framework Synthesis approach was used to synthesise the findings of the sample. We appraised the quality of each study using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skill Program) tool. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. The Stakeholder Panel was involved in each stage of the review from development of the protocol to development of the best practice principles.</ab>
        <ab>We found 182 studies that were eligible for inclusion. From this group, we selected 33 studies to include in the final synthesis. These studies came from a wide range of countries including 28 from high-income countries and five from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs). Each of the studies included the experiences and views of consumers and/or health providers of partnering in formal group formats. The results were divided into the following categories. Contextual factors influencing partnerships: government policy, policy implementation processes and funding, as well as the organisational context of the health service, could facilitate or impede partnering (moderate level of confidence). Consumer recruitment: consumer recruitment occurred in different ways and consumers managed the recruitment process in a minority of studies only (high level of confidence). Recruiting a range of consumers who were reflective of the clinic's demographic population was considered desirable, particularly by health providers (high level of confidence). Some health providers perceived that individual consumers' experiences were not generalisable to the broader population whereas consumers perceived it could be problematic to aim to represent a broad range of community views (high level of confidence). Partnership dynamics and processes: positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers facilitated partnerships (high level of confidence). However, formal meeting formats and lack of clarity about the consumer role could constrain consumers' involvement (high level of confidence). Health providers' professional status, technical knowledge and use of jargon were intimidating for some consumers (high level of confidence) and consumers could feel their experiential knowledge was not valued (moderate level of confidence). Consumers could also become frustrated when health providers dominated the meeting agenda (moderate level of confidence) and when they experienced token involvement, such as a lack of decision-making power (high level of confidence) Perceived impacts on partnership participants: partnering could affect health provider and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways (high level of confidence). Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation: partnering was perceived to improve the person-centredness of health service culture (high level of confidence), improve the built environment of the health service (high level of confidence), improve health service design and delivery e.g. facilitate 'out of hours' services or treatment closer to home (high level of confidence), enhance community ownership of health services, particularly in LMICs (moderate level of confidence), and improve consumer involvement in strategic decision-making, under certain conditions (moderate level of confidence). There was limited evidence suggesting partnering may improve health service evaluation (very low level of confidence). Best practice principles for formal partnering to promote person-centred care were developed from these findings. The principles were developed collaboratively with the Stakeholder Panel and included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision-making; influence and sustainability.</ab>
        <ab>Successful formal group partnerships with consumers require health providers to continually reflect and address power imbalances that may constrain consumers' participation. Such imbalances may be particularly acute in recruitment procedures, meeting structure and content and decision-making processes. Formal group partnerships were perceived to improve the physical environment of health services, the person-centredness of health service culture and health service design and delivery. Implementing the best practice principles may help to address power imbalances, strengthen formal partnering, improve the experiences of consumers and health providers and positively affect partnership outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The traditional residency selection process was altered dramatically by the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. For the 2020-2021 application cycle in-person interviews were transitioned to the virtual format. What was thought to be a temporary transition has now become the new standard with continued endorsement from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Society of Academic Urologists (SAU) for virtual interviews (VI). We sought to assess the perceived efficacy and satisfaction of the VI format from the urology residency program director's (PDs) perspective.</ab>
        <ab>A designated SAU Taskforce on "Optimizing the Applicant Experience in the Virtual Interview Era" developed and refined a survey composed of 69 questions on VI and was distributed to all urology program directors (PD) of member institutions of the SAU. The survey focused on candidate selection, faculty preparation, and interview day logistics. PDs were also asked to reflect on the impact of VI on their match results, recruitment of underrepresented minorities and female gender, and what their preference would be for future applications cycles.</ab>
        <ab>Urology residency PDs (84.7% response rate) between January 13, 2022 - February 10, 2022 were included in the study.</ab>
        <ab>Most programs interviewed a total of 36 to 50 applicants (80%), with an average of 10 to 20 applicants per interview day. The top 3 ranked criteria for interview selection reported by urology PDs surveyed included letters of recommendation, clerkship grades, and USMLE Step 1 score. The most common areas of formal training for faculty interviewers were diversity, equity and inclusion (55%), implicit bias (66%), and review of the SAU guidelines on illegal questions (83%). Over half (61.4%) of PDs believed that they were able to accurately represent their training program through the virtual platform, while 51% felt that VI did not afford similar assessments of applicant as in-person interviews. Two-thirds of PDs believed the VI platform improve access for all applicants to attend interviews. Focusing on the impact of the VI platform for recruitment of underrepresented minorities (URM) and female gender applicants, 15% and 24% reported improved visibility respectively for their program, and 24% and 11% reported increased ability to interview URM and female gender applicants respectively. Overall, in-person interviews were reported to be preferred by 42%, and 51% of PDs desired VIs to be included in future years.</ab>
        <ab>PDs opinion and role of the VIs into the future is variable. Despite uniform agreement of cost savings and belief that VI platform improves access for all, only half of PDs expressed interest of the VI format being continued in some form. PDs note limitation of VI in the ability to comprehensively assess applicants as well as the in-person format. Many programs have begun to incorporate vital training in the areas of diversity equity and inclusion bias, and illegal questions. There is a role for continued development and research on ways to optimize virtual interviews.</ab>

        <ab>Advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion in the physician workforce is essential to providing high-quality and culturally responsive patient care and has been shown to improve patient outcomes. To better characterize equity in the field of radiation oncology, we sought to describe the current academic radiation oncology workforce, including any contemporary differences in compensation and rank by gender and race/ethnicity.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiation Oncology Programs (SCAROP) 2018 Financial Survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with associate or full professor rank. Compensation was compared by gender and race/ethnicity overall and stratified by rank and was further analyzed using multivariable linear regression models.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 858 academic radiation oncologists from 63 departments in the United States in the sample, 33.2% were female, 65.2% were White, 27.2% were Asian, and 7.6% were underrepresented in medicine (URiM). There were 44.0% assistant professors, 32.0% associate professors, and 22.8% full professors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis for factors associated with associate or full professor rank did not reveal statistically significant associations between gender or race/ethnicity with academic rank (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.32; P  = .48 for gender; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.5-1.30; P  = .37 for Asian vs White; and OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.31-1.55; P  = .37 for URiM vs White), but CIs were wide due to sample size, and point estimates were &lt;1. Similarly, multivariable linear regression analysis modeling the log relative total compensation did not detect statistically significant differences between radiation oncologists by gender (-1.7%; 95% CI, -6.8% to 3.4%; P  = .51 for female vs male) or race/ethnicity (-1.6%; 95% CI, -7.3% to 4.0%; P  = .57 for Asian vs White and -3.0%; 95% CI, -12.1% to 6.0%; P  = .51 for URiM vs White).</ab>
        <ab>The low numbers of women and faculty with URiM race/ethnicity in this radiation oncology faculty sample limits the ability to compare career trajectory and compensation by those characteristics. Given that point estimates were &lt;1, our findings do not contradict larger multispecialty studies that suggest an ongoing need to monitor equity.</ab>

        <ab>Failure to diversify the United States scientific workforce has elicited statements and actions from federal funding agencies that are scrambling to correct inequities. Only last week, a new study showed that Black scientists are underrepresented among principal investigators who are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (at 1.8%). This is unacceptable. Science is a social endeavor where research only becomes knowledge when validated by the scientific community. A more diverse scientific community can average out individual biases, leading to more robust consensus. Meanwhile, conservative states are passing laws prohibiting higher education programs in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This is creating a collision course between state laws and federal funding policies and programs.</ab>

        <ab>Research shows that a diverse faculty improves academic, clinical, and research outcomes in higher education. Despite that, persons in minority groups, usually categorized by race or ethnicity, are underrepresented in academia (URiA). The Nutrition Obesity Research Centers (NORCs), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, hosted workshops on five separate days in September and October 2020. NORCs convened these workshops to identify barriers and facilitators for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and provide specific recommendations to improve DEI within obesity and nutrition for individuals from URiA groups. Recognized experts on DEI presented each day, after which the NORCs conducted breakout sessions with key stakeholders who engage in nutrition and obesity research. The breakout session groups included early-career investigators, professional societies, and academic leadership. The consensus from the breakout sessions was that glaring inequities affect URiA in nutrition and obesity, particularly related to recruitment, retention, and advancement. Recommendations from the breakout sessions to improve DEI across academia focused on six themes: (1) recruitment, (2) retention, (3) advancement, (4) intersectionality of multiple challenges (e.g., being Black and a woman), (5) funding agencies, and (6) implementation of strategies to address problems related to DEI.</ab>

        <ab>Many diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives assume that attainment of a racially diverse healthcare workforce will translate to increased diversity elsewhere in the healthcare system (e.g., leadership roles or academic authorship). We sought to investigate these trends over time by examining the evolution of physician demographics in the USA, in concert with demographic changes in US authorship in US medical journals from 1990 to 2020 across 25 specialties.</ab>
        <ab>We reviewed all articles indexed in PubMed, with a primary author affiliation located in the USA and limited to journals based in the USA, relative to the proportion of medical professionals in the CMS National Provider Registry. We employed a previously peer-reviewed/validated algorithm called "averaging-of-proportions" that probabilistically predicts racial identity from surname using the US Census to assess the relationship between diversity among medical professionals and diversity in medical journal authorship.</ab>
        <ab>Data reveals a sharp disconnect between the demographic breakdown of physicians and authors. Despite an increase in the number of Black physicians (from 8.5% in 2005 to 9.1% in 2020), there has been a decrease in Black early-career authorship from 7.2% in 1990 to 5.8% in 2020. The percentage of Black early-career authors across all specialties in 2020 is lower than the average per specialty in 1990. Similar trends were noted for Black senior authorship, decreasing from 7.6% in 1990 to 6.2% in 2020, as well as a plateau in Hispanic authorship over the same time interval despite an increasing number of Hispanic physicians.</ab>
        <ab>Modest advances in physician diversity have not translated to increased diversity in academic authorship. Increasing diversity requires initiatives focused beyond recruitment of underrepresented minorities to medical schools or residencies.</ab>

        <ab>In 2016, the IDWeek program committee was charged with ensuring gender equity in speaker sessions. Whether this charge also resulted in more opportunities for historically underrepresented speakers is unknown.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a retrospective analysis of trends in the demographic composition of IDWeek speakers and program committee members between 2013 and 2021. We used descriptive statistics to summarize data, χ2 tests to compare speaker demographics between 2013-2016 (before 2016) and 2017-2021 (after 2016), and Cochran-Armitage tests for trend. Each speaker slot was considered an independent event.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 5482 speaker slots were filled by 3389 individuals from 2013 to 2021. There was a linear increase in female speakers from 38.6% in 2013 to 58.4% in 2021 (P &lt; .001). The proportion of white speakers decreased overall from 84.9% in 2013 to 63.5% in 2021. Compared with white speakers, more slots were filled by Asian speakers after 2016 versus before 2016 (20.1% vs 14.8%, respectively; P &lt; .001). Program committee members from 2013-2021 were &gt;80% non-Hispanic white; &lt;5% of committee members identified as black, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic. More program committee slots were filled by women after 2016 than before 2016 (52.7% vs 33.9%; P = .004).</ab>
        <ab>Intentional consideration of gender equity by the program committee was associated with equitable gender representation of invited speakers at IDWeek after 2016. Gradually, the proportions of IDWeek speakers from historically excluded racial/ethnic approached their respective proportions in the IDSA membership. White speakers remained overrepresented relative to membership proportions until 2021, and gaps in program committee racial/ethnic demographic representation highlights opportunities for continued inclusion, diversity, access, and equity at IDWeek.</ab>

        <ab>The American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)-and the research community it supports-believes in the power of human genetics to advance science, health, and society. However, ASHG and the field have failed to acknowledge, fully and consistently, the misuse of human genetics to serve unjust ends or take action to denounce such use. As the community's oldest and largest professional society, ASHG also has been late in making explicit efforts to integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion into its values, programs, and voice. The Society affirmatively seeks to reckon with, and sincerely apologizes for, its involvement in and silence on the misuse of human genetics research to justify and contribute to injustices in all forms. It commits to sustain and expand its integration of equitable and just principles in the study and use of human genetics research, taking both immediate actions and swiftly determining longer-term goals it will set to realize the benefits of human genetics and genomics research for all.</ab>

        <ab>Bioethics is reexamining how to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice concerns into scholarship. However, bioethicists should question the categories used to define diversity. The act of categorization is value laden, and classification systems confer power and benefits and generate harms. For example, what conditions count as disabilities? We should consider the equity implications of offering only "male" and "female" options for self-identification in health records. However, we should also interrogate all ideas about categorization, including how categories are formed, why they are formed, and who decides. Bioethicists cannot comprehend fully what equity and justice mean for underrepresented, underserved, or marginalized people until there is an understanding of how the boundaries of marginalization are created.</ab>

        <ab>There is a need to optimize SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect staff and patients from healthcare-associated COVID-19 infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations implemented vaccine mandates for HCWs. Whether or not a traditional quality improvement approach can achieve high-rates of COVID-19 vaccination is not known. Our organization undertook iterative changes that focused on the barriers to vaccine uptake. These barriers were identified through huddles, and addressed through extensive peer outreach, with a focus on access and issues related to equity, diversity and inclusion. The outreach interventions were informed by real-time data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in our organization. The vaccine rate reached 92.3% by 6 December 2021 with minimal differences in vaccine uptake by professional role, clinical department, facility or whether the staff had a patient facing role. Improving vaccine uptake should be a quality improvement target in healthcare organizations and our experience shows that high vaccine rates are achievable through concerted efforts targeting specific barriers to vaccine confidence.</ab>

        <ab>Since 2015, there has been growing interest in Canada and beyond on the benefits of outdoor play for physical, emotional, social and environmental health, wellbeing and development, for adults as well as children and youth.</ab>
        <ab>This scoping review aims to answer the question, "How, and in what context, is adult-oriented outdoor play being studied in Canada?" We conducted an electronic search for peer-reviewed articles on outdoor play published in English or French after September 2015 by authors from Canadian institutions or about Canadian adults. The 224 retrieved articles were organized according to eight priorities: health, well-being and development; outdoor play environments; safety and outdoor play; cross-sectoral connections; equity, diversity and inclusion; professional development; Indigenous Peoples and land-based outdoor play; and COVID-19. We tallied the study designs and measurement methods used.</ab>
        <ab>The most common priority was outdoor play environments; the least common were COVID-19 and Indigenous Peoples and land-based outdoor play. Cross-sectional studies were the most common; no rapid reviews were identified. Sample sizes varied from one auto-ethnographic reflection to 147 000 zoo visitor datapoints. More studies used subjective than objective measurement methods. Environmental health was the most common outcome and mental/emotional development was the least.</ab>
        <ab>There has been a staggering amount of articles published on adult-oriented outdoor play in Canada since 2015. Knowledge gaps remain in the relationship between outdoor play and adult mental/emotional development; the connections between environmental health and Indigenous cultures and traditions; and how to balance promoting outdoor unstructured play with protecting and preserving natural spaces.</ab>

        <ab>The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) conducted extensive all-stakeholder inherited bleeding disorder (BD) community consultations to inform a blueprint for future research. Sustaining and expanding the specialized and comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Center care model, to better serve all people with inherited BDs (PWIBD), and increasing equitable access to optimal health emerged as top priorities.</ab>
        <ab>NHF, with the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN), convened multidisciplinary expert working groups (WG) to distill priority research initiatives from consultation findings. WG5 was charged with prioritizing health services research (HSR); diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); and implementation science (IS) research initiatives to advance community-identified priorities.</ab>
        <ab>WG5 identified multiple priority research themes and initiatives essential to capitalizing on this potential. Formative studies using qualitative and mixed methods approaches should be conducted to characterize issues and meaningfully investigate interventions. Investment in HSR, DEI and IS education, training, and workforce development are vital.</ab>
        <ab>An enormous amount of work is required in the areas of HSR, DEI, and IS, which have received inadequate attention in inherited BDs. This research has great potential to evolve the experiences of PWIBD, deliver transformational community-based care, and advance health equity.</ab>

        <ab>The National Hemophilia Foundation State of the Science Research Summit initiative sought to unify research efforts in the US inherited bleeding disorders (BDs) community around key topics of importance to people living with inherited BDs, the lived experience experts.</ab>
        <ab>This community-led and -informed project focused on six broad areas - hemophilia A or B; von Willebrand Disease (VWD), platelet dysfunctions and other mucocutaneous inherited BDs; ultra-rare inherited BDs; the unique challenges of people with the potential to menstruate with inherited BDs; diversity, equity and inclusion, health services research, and implementation science; and facilitating research in the inherited BD community through designing an optimizied research infrastructure, enabling resources and funding, and furthering workforce capabilities required to execute the research priorities.</ab>
        <ab>The work summarized here, and in the accompanying supplement manuscripts , has implications not only for the US population but for people globally who have inherited BDs. The information is equally relevant to people living with hemophilia, VWD, the spectrum of inherited platelet disorders, ultra-rare factor deficiencies, and all other inherited BDs as it is to the health care providers and researchers focused on the care and treatment of inherited BDs in the US and globally.</ab>

        <ab>There is a growing body of literature informing pedagogical content and strategies of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the education of speech-language pathologists. However, little discussion has included content related to LGBTQ+ people, even though LGBTQ+ people exist across all racial/ethnic groups. This article seeks to fill that void and provide instructors of speech-language pathology with practical information to educate their graduate students. The discussion uses a critical epistemology and invokes theoretical models, such as Queer/Quare theory, DisCrit, the Minority Stress Model, the Ethics of Care, and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy. Information is organized according to developing graduate students' awareness, knowledge, and skills and challenges instructors to modify current course content to disrupt systemic oppression.</ab>

        <ab>Structural racism is embedded within the structure and function of academic medical institutions. Although many institutions have begun to incorporate racial justice within academic medicine, it needs to be integral to every discipline and all aspects of medical education, research, and health system practice. Guidance is lacking, however, on how to create and sustain department-level action to shift culture and encourage antiracist work.</ab>
        <ab>To address the culture, uphold racial justice, and address the challenges of racism in medicine with dynamic and innovative solutions, the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at University of California, San Diego, formed a Culture and Justice Quorum (the Quorum) in September 2020. All department faculty, residents, fellows, and staff were invited to participate in the Quorum as ambassadors who commit to meet and facilitate Quorum work or as supporters who pledge Quorum support without regular meeting participation.</ab>
        <ab>In all, 153 of 155 invited individuals (98.7%) responded, with 36 (23.2%) requesting to participate as ambassadors and 117 (75.5%) as supporters. Quorum ambassadors have worked together to assess the climate of the department, university, and health system, including incorporating input and amplifying efforts of the department's resident leadership council. The Quorum has implemented initiatives to promote health equity and developed a report card to demonstrate activities, monitor progress, and ensure accountability.</ab>
        <ab>Through the innovative Culture and Justice Quorum, the department aims to address structural racism, foster justice, and dismantle the foundational injustices embedded within departmental clinical, educational, and research work and within the wider culture. The Quorum offers a model for creating and sustaining department-level action to shift culture and encourage antiracist work. Since established, it has received institutional recognition, including receiving the 2022 Inclusive Excellent Award for Department-Organizational Unit, which recognizes outstanding institutional contributions for inclusion and diversity efforts.</ab>

        <ab>The students at Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MCASOM) wrote a call to action to medical school leadership in June 2020. The students requested help in navigating socio-political barriers that affected one another and contributed to healthcare inequities and mistrust. Using the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) tool to assess cultural competence training, our team evaluated the baseline 2017-2018 MCASOM curriculum. There were 254 learning objectives, of which 43 (17%) were related to inclusion, diversity, antiracism, and equity (I-DARE). Mirroring the concerns of the students, the findings identified minimal content about antiracism and inclusion. By applying DMAIC principles for quality and process improvement, we aimed to increase the number of taught learning objectives about I-DARE content for the first-year and second-year medical students by 100%, from 43 to 86 objectives, without adversely affecting student satisfaction and true attendance. To address the underlying causes, we launched a virtual, multisite I-DARE medical school course and doubled the number of I-DARE-taught learning objectives from 43 to 107 (149%), compared with the baseline. The program evaluation review revealed that the students were self-reflective and provided a spectrum of experiences regarding the I-DARE course.</ab>

        <ab>At Advocate Aurora Health, the board of directors established parameters for effectively executing the governance (G) function related to ESG activities while adopting a comprehensive approach to ESG that includes the corporate commitment to health equity. Establishing a board diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committee with external experts served to integrate these efforts with the ESG strategy. This approach will continue to guide the board of directors of Advocate Health, formed in December 2022, by the combination of Advocate Aurora Health and Atrium Health. Our experience has demonstrated that empowering individual board committee members of not-for-profit healthcare organizations to embrace their unique responsibility for driving ESG requires collective efforts in the boardroom as well as a commitment to board refreshment and diversity.</ab>

        <ab>COVID-19 vaccines offer hope to end the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we document key lessons learned as we continue to confront COVID-19 variants and work to adapt our vaccine outreach strategies to best serve our community. In the fall of 2020, the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Health Equity at Johns Hopkins Medicine, in collaboration with the Office of Government and Community Affairs for Johns Hopkins University and Medicine, established the COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Community Education and Outreach Initiative in partnership with faith and community leaders, local and state government representatives, and community-based organizations. Working with community and government partnerships established before COVID-19 enabled our team to quickly build infrastructure focused on COVID-19 vaccine education and equity. These partnerships resulted in the development and implementation of web-based educational content, major culturally adapted media campaigns (reaching more than 200,000 individuals), community and faith education outreach, youth-focused initiatives, and equity-focused mobile vaccine clinics. The community mobile vaccine clinics vaccinated over 3,000 people in the first 3 months. Of these, 90% identified as persons of color who have been disproportionately impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Academic-government-community partnerships are vital to ensure health equity. Community partnerships, education events, and open dialogues were conducted between the community and medical faculty. Using nontraditional multicultural media venues enabled us to reach many community members and facilitated informed decisionmaking. Additionally, an equitable COVID-19 vaccine policy requires attention to vaccine access as well as access to sound educational information. Our initiative has been thoughtful about using various types of vaccination sites, mobile vaccine units, and flexible hours of operation.</ab>

        <ab>Although diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are progressively being implemented across various arenas in academic medicine, biomedical research, and healthcare, significant inequities throughout medicine and biomedical research remain. One means by which to rectify these long-standing inequities is through the implementation of a position dedicated to DEI among journal editorial boards; thus, we sought to assess the extent to which this position has been implemented among high-impact biomedical research journals.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the editorial boards of the top 100 journals by impact factor (IF) across 30 medical specialties. All editorial board positions (editors-in-chief, deputy, associate, and assistant editors, as well as editorial and advisory board members) were included. We also assessed the proportion of other named-position editors (i.e. social media and statistics editors), and compared these to the proportion of DEI editors.</ab>
        <ab>Among the 100 highest IF biomedical journals (range: 12.035-508.702), 6 (6%) have a DEI editorial position. In contrast, 25 (25%) and 35 (35%) journals have at least 1 social media or statistics editorial position, respectively. The DEI editorial position comprises 0.086% of the 6974 total editorial positions, while social media (60/6974) and statistical (196/6974) editors comprise 0.86% and 2.81% of total journal editorial board positions, respectively.</ab>
        <ab>Few of the most influential biomedical journals have implemented a formal, named position dedicated to DEI. Biomedical journals should consider establishing a dedicated DEI editorial position, and ensure this individual position is publicly denoted on the editorial board.</ab>

        <ab>Despite significant improvements in pediatric cancer survival outcomes, there remain glaring disparities in under-represented racial and ethnic groups that warrant mitigation by the scientific and clinical community. To address and work towards eliminating such disparities, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) and Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) established a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) working group in 2020. The DEI working group is dedicated to improving access to care for all pediatric patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, broadening diversity within the research community, and providing sustainable data-driven solutions. To this end, the DEI working group aims to coordinate regular educational sessions centered on critical DEI topics in pediatric research and clinical care of pediatric patients, with a focus on pediatric neuro-oncology. In April 2022, the group led a moderated panel of experts on Indigenous Peoples' rights and participation in clinical research activities. The following paper serves to provide the scientific community a perspective on how to prioritize the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in research with cultural sensitivity and with the intent of improving not only representation, but patient outcomes regardless of patient race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background.</ab>

        <ab>While increasing diversity has been an ongoing concern in physician assistant (PA) education, there is now a concentrated focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice, elevating these to top priorities. To achieve the goal of diversifying the PA workforce, PA programs, with their institution's support, must systematically inculcate strategies for overcoming and dismantling barriers against students of color and students underrepresented in medicine (URiM). These strategies should disrupt the status quo and expand structural processes that ensure successful diversification of students, especially URiM students, LGBTQ students, students from medically underserved areas, and first-generation college students.</ab>

        <ab>Hospital medicine (HM) has a well-described gender disparity related to academic work and promotion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, female authorship across medicine fell further behind historical averages.</ab>
        <ab>Examine how COVID-19 affected the publication gender gap for hospitalists.</ab>
        <ab>Bibliometric analysis to determine gender and specialty of US-based physician first and last authors of COVID-19 articles published March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 in the four highest impact general medical journals and two highest impact HM-specific journals.</ab>
        <ab>We characterized the percentage of all physician authors that were women, the percentage of physician authors that were hospitalists, and the percentage of HM authors that were women. We compared author gender between general medical and HM-specific journals.</ab>
        <ab>During the study period, 853 manuscripts with US-based first or last authors were published in eligible journals. Included manuscripts contained 1124 US-based physician first or last author credits, of which 34.2% (384) were women and 8.8% (99) were hospitalists. Among hospitalist author credits, 43.4% (n = 43/99) were occupied by women. The relative gender equity for hospitalist authors was driven by the two HM journals where, compared to the four general medical journals, hospitalist authors (54.1% [33/61] vs. 26.3% [10/38] women, respectively, p = .002) and hospitalist last authors (51.9% [14/27] vs. 20% [4/20], p = .03) were more likely to be women.</ab>
        <ab>Across COVID-19-related manuscripts, disparities by gender were driven by the high-impact general medical journals. HM-specific journals had more equitable inclusion of women authors, demonstrating the potential impact of proactive editorial policies on diversity.</ab>

        <ab>Considering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in clinical trials ensures that data collected for investigational treatments reflect the populations most likely to benefit from those therapies. Resources and recommendations regarding DEI were assembled by the trial sponsor to assist clinical trial development.</ab>
        <ab>A cross-disciplinary team from the sponsoring organization was assembled to inform trial planning and collate resources that promote DEI throughout the clinical trial life cycle.</ab>
        <ab>Representatives from clinical operations, health economic outcomes research, medical affairs, patient advocacy, procurement, and research and development functional groups united together to implement DEI strategies in clinical trials. Planning strategies focus on eligibility, participant/patient engagement, feedback through patient advocacy organizations, and community interactions. Informed site, investigator, and vendor selection at trial startup supports efforts to recruit diverse target trial populations and engage underrepresented businesses; establishing relationships and demographic target-goal tracking should be maintained throughout trial management. Continued communication during trial closeout consolidates learnings and enhances partnerships with trial participants and patient advocacy organizations. The sponsoring organization continuously updates an internal library of resources to facilitate implementation of outlined strategies.</ab>
        <ab>This first iteration of guidance intends to improve the representation of target populations who will ultimately benefit from investigational therapies; to assist sponsor clinical trial teams in developing recruitment and retention plans; and to ensure compliance with federal granting agencies. The sponsoring organization anticipates data from future clinical trials will help characterize the impact of these initiatives to ensure evidence-based practices are used in future clinical trials to enhance DEI.</ab>

        <ab>Board diversity is increasingly important for hospitals and healthcare systems, with national attention focused on eliminating health disparities and improving health equity. Yet, it remains a challenge despite concerted efforts by leading professional associations (e.g., American College of Healthcare Executives) to galvanize their constituents around the importance of the issue.</ab>
        <ab>This study used survey data from The Governance Institute to explore the ethnoracial and gender diversity of hospital boards spanning 2011 through 2021.</ab>
        <ab>The results showed modest gains in the mean number of female board members, although a small proportion of hospital boards still have no female representation. There was little change in the number of boards with ethnic minority representation until an uptick in 2021, likely in direct response to high-profile racial incidents and protests.</ab>
        <ab>Intentional and sustained efforts are necessary to increase diversity and create a culture of inclusion that fosters meaningful engagement of diverse board members.</ab>

        <ab>There is a clear and growing need to be able record and track the contributions of individual registered nurses (RNs) to patient care and patient care outcomes in the US and also understand the state of the nursing workforce. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, The Future of Nursing 2020-2030: Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity (2021), identified the need to track nurses' collective and individual contributions to patient care outcomes. This capability depends upon the adoption of a unique nurse identifier and its implementation within electronic health records. Additionally, there is a need to understand the nature and characteristics of the overall nursing workforce including supply and demand, turnover, attrition, credentialing, and geographic areas of practice. This need for data to support workforce studies and planning is dependent upon comprehensive databases describing the nursing workforce, with unique nurse identification to support linkage across data sources. There are two existing national nurse identifiers- the National Provider Identifier and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing Identifier. This article provides an overview of these two national nurse identifiers; reviews three databases that are not nurse specific to understand lessons learned in the development of those databases; and discusses the ethical, legal, social, diversity, equity, and inclusion implications of a unique nurse identifier.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in academia are leading publishers and journals to re-examine their use of terminology for commonly used scientific variables. This reassessment of language is particularly important for human genetics, which is focused on identifying and explaining differences between individuals and populations. Recent guidance on the use of terms and symbols in clinical practice, research, and publications is beginning to acknowledge the ways that language and concepts of difference can be not only inaccurate but also harmful. To stop perpetuating historical wrongs, those of us who conduct and publish genetic research and provide genetic health care must understand the context of the terms we use and why some usages should be discontinued. In this article, we summarize critiques of terminology describing disability, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and ancestry in research publications, laboratory reports, diagnostic codes, and pedigrees. We also highlight recommendations for alternative language that aims to make genetics more inclusive, rigorous, and ethically sound. Even though norms of acceptable language use are ever changing, it is the responsibility of genetics professionals to uncover biases ingrained in professional practice and training and to continually reassess the words we use to describe human difference because they cause harm to patients.</ab>

        <ab>Current clinical research does not reflect the diversity of patient populations, despite continued recommendations to increase enrollment of under-represented racial and ethnic groups. The ramifications of this lack of trial diversity are important because of potential differences between races and ethnicities in response to therapies, which have been observed for drugs across indications. Nonrepresentative research populations limit the generalizability of study results, which may lead to questions about safety and efficacy in certain subgroups of patients and hinder regulators, healthcare providers, and patients in their ability to adequately consider the benefits and risks of a therapeutic treatment across all populations. Renewed efforts to address healthcare disparities and increase diversity in clinical trials have demonstrated that inclusive trials are achievable and can provide scientifically rigorous results, and, thus, should stimulate greater action across all stakeholders. Ensuring that studies throughout the clinical development process include representative populations is a scientific imperative to advance health equity, racial justice, and trust in the safety and efficacy of medical therapies. This article reviews the long-standing lack of diversity and barriers to enrollment of diverse and representative populations in clinical trials, outlines the current evolving trial landscape and the efforts of stakeholders, and provides examples from scientifically rigorous inclusive trials. The goal is to share learnings in a wider context of opportunities to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical development while ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical therapies in all populations of patients, and in doing so, provide wider patient access to therapeutic treatments.</ab>

        <ab>Women and people from most racial and ethnic groups in the United States have historically been under-represented in clinical trials of investigational medical products. Inadequate representation of these groups may lead to an incomplete understanding of the safety and efficacy of new drugs, devices, biologics, and vaccines, and limit the generalizability of trial findings. As a result, new medical products may not be beneficial to all people who need them, and existing inequities in outcomes among various population groups may remain unchanged or worsen, or new disparities may arise. Although much work has focused on study-level strategies, research organizations must make systemic changes to how clinical trials are envisioned and implemented to achieve sustainable support for diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) conducted interviews with leaders at institutions that conduct clinical trials to explore perspectives on organizational-level practices that promote diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. Leaders described motivations, such as an ethical and moral imperative; organizational practices, such as staff investment and resource allocation; perceived return on investments, such as better science; and deterrents, such as cost and time. The CTTI also convened an expert meeting to discuss the interview findings and provide guidance. We present the interview findings and expert guidance in a framework that describes four key areas-commitment, partnerships, accountability, and resources-on sustaining organizational-level approaches for improving diversity and inclusion in clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of advancing health equity. Institutions who conduct and support clinical trials should implement organizational-level approaches to improve equitable access and diverse patient participation in clinical trials.</ab>

        <ab>To evaluate the presence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) among US occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) residency program websites.</ab>
        <ab>In January to February 2022, two independent reviewers evaluated the websites of all 24 US accredited OEM residency programs and documented the presence of 10 predetermined DEI metrics and resident/faculty photographs and biographies.</ab>
        <ab>Program websites included a median of 1 (0-3) DEI element with 46% of websites containing none of the DEI metrics. Faculty photographs and biographies were included in 83% and 75% of websites, respectively. Resident photographs and biographies were included in 50% and 25% of websites, respectively.</ab>
        <ab>Many OEM residency program websites lack DEI presence. Programs should consider presenting information relevant to DEI on their websites to help attract more diverse applicant pools.</ab>

        <ab>Environmental justice is the concept that all people have the right to live in a healthy environment, to be protected against environmental hazards, and to participate in decisions affecting their communities. Communities of color and low-income populations live, work, and play in environments with disproportionate exposure to hazards associated with allergic disease. This unequal distribution of hazards has contributed to health disparities and is largely the result of systemic racism that promotes segregation of neighborhoods, disinvestment in predominantly racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods, and discriminatory housing, employment, and lending practices. The AAAAI Environmental Exposure and Respiratory Health Committee and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee jointly developed this report to improve allergy/immunology specialists' awareness of environmental injustice, its roots in systemic racism, and its impact on health disparities in allergic disease. We present evidence supporting the relationship between exposure to environmental hazards, particularly at the neighborhood level, and the disproportionately high incidence and poor outcomes from allergic diseases in marginalized populations. Achieving environmental justice requires investment in at-risk communities to increase access to safe housing, clean air and water, employment opportunities, education, nutrition, and health care. Through policies that promote environmental justice, we can achieve greater health equity in allergic disease.</ab>

        <ab>Clinical trial participant populations fail to adequately represent target populations that drugs are intended to serve. Improving racial and ethnic diversity of clinical trial participants is essential for generalizable, quality clinical research results and ensuring social and medical equity. Site-level clinical research professionals (CRPs) have unique insights on diversity improvement strategies for clinical trial enrollment. A survey was distributed to current CRPs working at clinical research sites in the United States to describe current practices and perceptions of the impact these practices have on participant diversity. Subsequently, descriptive quantitative analysis and inductive content analysis were performed. For the practices surveyed, there are discrepancies between frequency of use and perceived impact on diversity enrollment. Common current practices include phone-based or telemedicine study visits, electronic/digital data collection, and participant compensation. However, we report travel reimbursement and services, translated documents and translator services, and adequate participant compensation as most impactful on diverse enrollment. A multistakeholder approach is necessary to enhance diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) of study participants. Besides large-scale solutions such as countering community distrust, actionable steps are needed by sponsors and study sites to improve D&amp;I of trial participants. Study leadership at the sponsor, contract research organization (CRO), and site-level should create diversity plans prior to study start, and CRO and sponsor budgets should consider D&amp;I strategies during study planning. Planning should incorporate strategies to improve D&amp;I including adequate participant compensation, translated documents and translator services, and travel reimbursements.</ab>

        <ab>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic prohibited Canadian medical students from in-person observerships. This may be particularly detrimental to under-represented groups that may consider surgical subspecialties. To address the unprecedented need for alternative surgical career exploration and diversity within the profession, The University of Toronto Cardiac Surgery Interest Group and Division of Cardiac Surgery collaborated on virtual experiential programming.</ab>
        <ab>Medical students were invited to virtual (1) observerships of a cardiac bypass case, (2) mentorship sessions with surgeons, (3) resident teaching sessions, (4) multidisciplinary case-based Heart Team discussions to further their understanding of the scope of Cardiac surgery, and (5) a virtual coronary anastomosis training program. Additionally, a comprehensive virtual program was spearheaded to increase interest in Cardiac surgery among low-income Black high school students.</ab>
        <ab>Trainee response to the virtual education, mentorship, and skill acquisition was positive. Trainees reported high levels of interest in the profession, particularly among females and under-represented minorities, supporting the principles of equity diversity, and inclusion in Cardiac surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare disparities are a persistent societal problem. One of the contributing factors to this status quo is the lack of diversity and representativeness of research efforts, which result in nongeneralizable evidence that, in turn, provides suboptimal means to enable the best possible outcomes at the individual level. There are several strategies that research teams can adopt to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) of their efforts; these strategies span the totality of the research path, from initial design to the shepherding of clinical data through a potential regulatory process. These strategies include more intentionality and DEI-based goal-setting, more diverse research and leadership teams, better community engagement to set study goals and approaches, better tailored outreach interventions, decentralization of study procedures and incorporation of innovative technology for more flexible data collection, and self-surveillance to identify and prevent biases. Within their remit of overlooking research efforts, regulatory authorities, as stakeholders, also have the potential for a positive effect on the DEI of emerging clinical evidence. All these are implementable tools and mechanisms that can make study participation more approachable to diverse communities, and ultimately generate evidence that is more generalizable and a conduit for better outcomes. The research community has an imperative to make DEI principles key foundational aspects in study conduct in order to pursue better personalized medicine for diverse patient populations.</ab>

        <ab>Increased awareness of social injustices and inequities highlight the relevance and importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in health care. Former and recent graduates of pharmacy schools remain deficient in their knowledge of DEIA topics such as unconscious bias, which can directly influence health outcomes in an undesirable manner. Particular DEIA areas that are pertinent to pharmacy practice include: race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability status, religion, socioeconomic status, and political beliefs. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) affirmed its commitment to DEIA as a priority. However, existing gaps in knowledge of pharmacy graduates in this area have the potential to contribute to health disparities and inequities, which are significant public health issues. We call on academic pharmacy institutions and professional pharmacy organizations to elevate DEIA topics and to designate them as essential to both addressing health equity and improving care for underserved populations. We also implore licensing boards to require continuing education related to DEIA as a foundational step to closing the knowledge gap for pharmacists in this area.</ab>

        <ab>Given the diversity of populations that modern healthcare professionals treat, there has been an increasing call for academic medical centers to ensure that they themselves are diverse and inclusive. Historically, this has been measured by the composition of the workforce in terms of protected categories such as race/ethnicity, gender, and disability. However, these broad categories have only poorly reflected the actual ability of organizations to engage with a diverse workforce and patient population. The diversity and engagement survey (DES) is a specifically constructed and validated instrument designed to measure the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within academic medical centers. The goal of the present study was to use the DES with vascular surgery program directors, to determine the predictors of low DEI in vascular surgery training programs.</ab>
        <ab>An anonymous electronic survey was sent to all program directors and assistant program directors of vascular surgery training programs (residencies and fellowships) in the United States (n = 280). The survey consisted of 18 sections with 53 questions regarding details of the respondent, demographics, programmatic information, including information on faculty and trainee diversity, the resources available to enhance DEI within the program, institutional attitudes toward employees, and the DES itself. The total score from the DES section was used to the stratify institutions, which were classified as low DEI if in the bottom 25% percentile of the overall scores or as high DEI if scoring higher. Univariate analysis was used to determine whether any important differences were present in the demographics or survey responses between the institutions scoring as low vs high DEI. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed using the demographic variables and responses to the survey questions to determine their relationship to DEI status.</ab>
        <ab>There were a total of 102 complete responses to the survey (36.4% response rate). The proportion of women was higher (66.67%) than the men (33.30%) in the low DEI cohort, although women were only 28.4% of the overall cohort. A statistically significant difference was found between the high and low DEI institutions in the proportion of those who had responded yes, no, or preferred not to disclose whether they had experienced discrimination or hurtful comments (P &lt; .001) with 71% of the respondents in the low DEI institutions reporting this experience compared with only 11% in high DEI institutions. Multivariate analysis also demonstrated that non-male gender (odds ratio, 5.10; P = .034) and experiences of discrimination (odds ratio, 6.51; P = .024) were associated with low DEI institutions.</ab>
        <ab>Non-male program directors and those who had experienced discrimination at their institution were significantly more likely to find that their institution had low DEI.</ab>

        <ab>Equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) are increasingly important directives in medicine that add further complexity to adjudications. The analytic hierarchy process is proposed as a tool for multicriteria decision-making that can facilitate the incorporation of EDI directives, especially for collective, group determinations.</ab>

        <ab>Radiology is among the medical specialties that have made the fewest gains in closing the gap in underrepresented minorities and women. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are important for promoting healthy learning environments for trainees, health equity for patients, and equitable career development opportunities for employees, all of which contribute to innovation in today's competitive health care environment. DEI committees can self-organize or form from institutional directives. These committees can implement impactful projects in multiple domains in education, recruitment and retention, department culture, and health equity research. This article describes the formation of a grassroots DEI committee, key initiatives and strategies, and structures for accountability. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.</ab>

        <ab>To assess Muslim physician experiences with religious discrimination and identify strategies for better accommodating Muslim identity in health care.</ab>
        <ab>Interviews were conducted with Muslim physicians from three US-based Muslim clinician organizations between June and August 2021.</ab>
        <ab>In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews used a phenomenological approach to describe experiences of religious discrimination and accommodation. A team-based framework approach to coding was used to inductively generate themes from interview data.</ab>
        <ab>Physicians from the Islamic Medical Association of North America, American Muslim Health Professionals, and the US Muslim Physicians group were invited to participate using closed organizational listservs. Inclusion criteria sought English-speaking, self-identifying Muslims with current or past affiliation with a university hospital in the United States. Potential participants were segmented into groups based on responses to questions about perceived religious discrimination and accommodation. Purposive sampling was used to iteratively approach participants within these groups in order to capture a diverse respondent pool. Interviews stopped after thematic saturation was reached.</ab>
        <ab>Eighteen physicians (11 women and 7 men; mean age: 41.5 [standard deviation = 12.91] years) were interviewed. Nearly all (n = 16) held Islam to be important in their lives. Three overarching themes, with several subthemes, emerged. Participants (1) struggled to maintain religious practices and observances due to unaccommodating organizational structures; (2) experienced religious discrimination, which, in turn, impacted their professional trajectories and, at times, their personal well-being; and (3) believed that institutions could implement specific educational and policy interventions to advance the religious accommodation of Muslims in health care.</ab>
        <ab>Muslim physicians frequently encounter religious discrimination, yet there are concrete ways in which health care workplaces can better accommodate their religious needs and combat discrimination. To improve workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion, educational forums and policies that support the religious practices of physicians need to be established.</ab>

        <ab>Leadership of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia created the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee in 2018 to prioritize diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee implemented a baseline survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership in 2020 to assess demographics, equity in leadership, inclusivity, and attitudes toward diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia plays a significant role in shaping the future of pediatric anesthesiology and in supporting our diverse pediatric patients.</ab>
        <ab>This study is an IRB-exempt, cross-sectional survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership. Quantitative analysis provided descriptive statistics of demographics, practice characteristics, and involvement within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. Qualitative thematic analysis provided an in-depth assessment of perceptions of diversity, challenges faced, and prioritization of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia.</ab>
        <ab>Out of 3 242 Society for Pediatric Anesthesia members, 1 232 completed the survey representing 38% of overall membership. Respondents were 89.2% United States members, 52.7% female, 55.7% non-Hispanic White, 88.6% heterosexual, 95.7% non-military, 59.2% religious, and 2.1% have an Americans with Disabilities Act recognized disability. All major United States geographical areas were represented equally with 71% practicing in urban areas and 67% in academic settings. Ethnic/racial minorities were more likely to be international medical graduates (p &lt; .001). Among United States members, 41.5% report being fluent in a language other than English, and 23.5% of those fluent in another language are certified to interpret. Compared to men, women are less likely to be in leadership roles (p &lt; .003), but we found no difference in participation and leadership when stratified by race/ethnicity, geography, international medical graduate status, or sexuality. Racial/ethnic minorities (p &lt; .028), women (p &lt; .001), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer members (p &lt; .044) more frequently hold lower academic rank positions when compared to white, heterosexual, and male members. Half of respondents were unsure whether diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges existed within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia while the other half demonstrated opposing views. Among those who reported diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges, the themes centered around persistent marginalization, the need for more inclusive policies and increased psychological safety, and lack of leadership diversity.</ab>
        <ab>Compared to the diversity of the pediatric population we serve, there are still significant gaps in demographic representation within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. As well, there is no consensus among Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership regarding perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in pediatric anesthesia in the United States. Among those who reported diversity challenges, opportunities for the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and Anesthesiology Departments to better support minoritized members included bolstering workforce diversity efforts and awareness via more inclusive policies, improved psychological safety, and increasing diversity in leadership. If pediatric anesthesiology is like other specialties, gaining consensus and improving diversity in the workforce might advance pediatric anesthesia innovation, quality, and safety for children of all backgrounds in the United States.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion for all members of the academic medical community has gained recent attention. Academic medical organizations have attempted to increase broader representation while seeking structural reforms consistent with the goal of enhancing equity and reducing disproportionality. However, efforts remain constrained while minority groups continue to experience discrimination. In this study, the authors sought to identify and understand the discursive effects of discrimination policies within medical education. The authors assembled an archive of 22 texts consisting of publicly available discrimination and harassment policy documents in 13 Canadian medical schools that were active as of November 2019. Each text was analysed to identify themes, rhetorical strategies, problematization, and power relations. Policies described truth statements that appear to idealize equity, yet there were discourses related to professionalism and neutrality that were in tension with these ideals. There was also tension between organizations' framing of a shared responsibility for addressing discrimination and individual responsibility on complainants. Lastly, there were also competing discourses on promoting freedom from discrimination and the concept of academic freedom. Overall, findings reveal several areas of tension that shape how discrimination is addressed in policy versus practice. Existing discourses regarding self-protection and academic freedom suggest equity cannot be advanced through policy discourse alone and more substantive structural transformation may be necessary. Existing approaches may be inadequate to address discrimination unless academic medical organizations interrogate the source of these discursive tensions and consider asymmetries of power.</ab>

Bioethics, health care, and health-related research all need more professionals from minoritized groups, but all of us need to do more to address justice at every level. From inclusive workplace policies and practices to research into structural injustices and health disparities, bioethics can and must lead the way in collaborative efforts. The work belongs to all of us, and DEI is only the beginning.</ab>

        <ab>A racially and ethnically diverse physician workforce is critical to meeting the needs of the United States' increasingly diverse patient population. Unfortunately, Black, Lat-inx, American Indian, and Alaska Native communities remain underrepresented in medicine. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by race/ethnicity and increased public attention to anti-Black and anti-Asian racism have inspired a growing national discourse on addressing systemic racism. Within academic medicine, there has been a call for the fundamental incorporation of antiracism into medical training and professional competency. From the perspective of a group primarily led by residents who are women of color, we describe our 6 years of experience leading a Diversity Committee that catalyzed sustained and systemic efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and antiracism at a large urban pediatrics residency program. We outline the implementation and key outcomes of the Diversity Committee's ongoing initiatives to increase resident diversity, foster an inclusive learning environment, develop a resident curriculum on DEI and antiracism, and center the needs and wisdom of the communities that our institution serves. Finally, we highlight challenges and lessons learned to inform other institutions striving to advance DEI and antiracism in academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>A racially and ethnically diverse physician workforce is critical to meeting the needs of the United States' increasingly diverse patient population. Unfortunately, Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Alaska Native communities remain underrepresented in medicine. The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by race/ethnicity and increased public attention to anti-Black and anti-Asian racism have inspired a growing national discourse on addressing systemic racism. Within academic medicine, there has been a call for the fundamental incorporation of antiracism into medical training and professional competency. From the perspective of a group primarily led by residents who are women of color, we describe our 6 years of experience leading a Diversity Committee that catalyzed sustained and systemic efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and antiracism at a large urban pediatrics residency program. We outline the implementation and key outcomes of the Diversity Committee's ongoing initiatives to increase resident diversity, foster an inclusive learning environment, develop a resident curriculum on DEI and antiracism, and center the needs and wisdom of the communities that our institution serves. Finally, we highlight challenges and lessons learned to inform other institutions striving to advance DEI and antiracism in academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Recent public awareness of racial and ethnic disparities has again brought to light issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the eating disorders field. However, empirical information on racial and ethnic representation in eating disorders research is limited, making it difficult to understand where improvements are needed.</ab>
        <ab>This study reviewed all studies including human participants published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Differences in likelihood of reporting race and ethnicity were calculated based on study year, location, and diagnostic categories.</ab>
        <ab>Out of 377 manuscripts, 45.2% reported information on the race and ethnicity of study participants. Studies conducted in the United States were more likely to report (128/173), and those conducted in Europe were less likely to report (5/61) on race and ethnicity than those conducted outside of those regions. Rates of reporting increased from 2000 to 2020. White participants made up approximately 70% of the samples that reported race and ethnicity data. Hispanic participants made up approximately 10% of samples reporting race and ethnicity. Participants from all other races and ethnicities made up less than 5% each.</ab>
        <ab>Although rates of reporting race and ethnicity increased over time, most participants were White. Rates of reporting also differed by the geographical region, which may reflect variability in how information on race and ethnicity is collected across countries. More attention toward capturing the cultural background of research participants and more inclusivity in research are needed in the eating disorders field.</ab>

        <ab>Promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders (EDs) field among professionals and the populations studied and served has long been discussed, with limited progress. This may be due to a reinforcing feedback loop in which individuals from dominant cultures conduct research and deliver treatment, participate in research, and receive diagnoses and treatment. This insularity maintains underrepresentation: EDs in historically marginalized populations are understudied, undetected, and undertreated. An Early Career Investigators Workshop generated recommendations for change that were not inherently novel but made apparent that accountability is missing. This paper serves as a call to action to spearhead a paradigm shift from equality to equity in the ED field. We provide a theoretical framework, suggest ways to disrupt the feedback loop, and summarize actionable steps to increase accountability in ED leadership and research toward enhancing racial/ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). These actionable steps are outlined in the service of challenging our field to reflect the diversity of our global community. We must develop and implement measurable metrics to assess our progress toward increasing diversity of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and to address JEDI issues in our providers, patients, and research participants.</ab>

        </tig>
        <aug />
        <sug />
        <ab>Context: Physical mobility and social participation are requisite for independence and quality of life as one ages. Barriers to mobility lead to social isolation, poor physical and mental health, all of which are precursors to frailty. To date, most mobility-enhancing interventions in older adults have been designed by researchers without citizen input and delivered in controlled settings; their translation to real-world contexts is often impractical and rarely occurs. Objectives: i) To engage older adults and community service providers to qualitatively explore priorities, needs, enablers and barriers to mobility and community participation faced by older adults, and ii) To co-design an evidence-informed, feasible, acceptable group intervention to support mobility and promote health among older adults facing health inequities. Study Design: Adapted experience-based co-design, conducted in collaboration with a Strategic Guiding Council comprised of older adults and service providers. Setting: Community-based. Population studied: Community-dwelling older adults (55+) and local health and social service providers. Outcome Measures: EMBOLDEN's Strategic Guiding Council and the research team collectively interpreted qualitative study findings, together with results of completed systematic reviews and an environmental scan, to determine priority design features of a community-based mobility-enhancing intervention to enable health and well-being in older adults in Hamilton, ON. Results: Eighteen diverse older adults and 16 service providers completed persona scenario interviews. These lived experience perspectives were analyzed, interpreted, and integrated with research and local evidence in the intervention co-design process. Priority design features for the intervention included duration, intensity, mode of delivery, characteristics of interventionists, and implementation strategies. Findings highlighted key strategies related to participant motivation, recruitment, and engagement, as well as important equity, diversity, and inclusion considerations. Conclusions: Partnering with diverse stakeholders is critical to identifying optimal design features of a community-based intervention to promote mobility. Ultimately, we aim to implement and evaluate a health promoting intervention that is sustainable, scalable, addresses health inequities, and effectively improves the lives of older adults.</ab>

        </tig>
        <aug />
        <sug />
        <ab>Context: The Presence 5 for Racial Justice (P5RJ), an adaptation of the Stanford Presence 5 framework practices, comprises anti-racism clinician communication practices that promote health equity and build trusting relationships with Black patients. Objective: We sought to identify specific statements and actions that clinicians use to promote racial justice in their clinical care. Study Design: Mixed-methods analysis of a survey, using deductive and inductive approaches to identify themes in qualitative data. Dataset: N=53 specific phrases provided in response to open-ended survey prompts related to the P5RJ practices. Population studied: N=50 respondents (27 clinicians, 17 medical trainees, and 6 unreported) recruited through convenience sampling and listservs of clinicians with expertise in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Respondents identified as Asian (9), Black/African American (10), Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish Origin (4), White/Caucasian (20), Write-in (1), and more than one race/ethnicity (6). Outcome Measures: Clinician statements were mapped to P5RJ domains and were categorized using Goffman's communication theory as 1) inquiry (e.g. "What effect (if any) do you feel race has had on your health or your interactions with the health care system?"), 2) self-accountability (e.g. "I am sorry I made that assumption"), 3) empathetic statements (e.g. "You seem sad, but maybe I am misinterpreting that. How are you feeling?"), and/or 4) statements of allyship (e.g. "Would you let me know if you feel you can't speak up and I will speak up for you?"). Results: Across all five practices, "Inquiry" was the predominant theme identified (58.5%), followed by "Empathy" (24.5%), "Statements of Allyship" (9.4%), and "Self-Accountability" (7.5%). 94% of respondents indicated diversity, equity, and inclusion involvement, and all respondents who provided specific phrases were in this category. Conclusions: Clinicians and medical trainees alike use inquiry as a predominant communication practice when addressing racism and promoting health equity. This may be due to a higher comfort level given the central role of question-asking during history-taking in medical training and clinical care. Our findings suggest an opportunity to focus anti-racism communication training on statements of empathy, self-accountability, and allyship. Future research is needed to evaluate patient preferences on appropriate types of clinician statements to promote health equity in clinical care.</ab>

        <ab>Effective engagement on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires activities that promote deep introspection and group conversations that serve to complement and build upon formal DEI presentations. The arts and humanities by their nature allow for intentional and sustained reflection and have the potential to be transformative of thinking. We therefore propose that the next phase of institutional pro-equity/anti-racism efforts includes arts- and humanities-based initiatives to facilitate reflection and that serve to complement and build upon formal DEI didactic presentations, implicit bias workshops, and anti-racism training.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of centering health equity in future health system and primary care reforms. Strengthening primary care will be needed to correct the longstanding history of mistreatment of First Nations/Indigenous and racialized people, exclusion of health care workers of color, and health care access and outcome inequities further magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released a report on Implementing High-Quality Primary Care: Rebuilding the Foundation of Health Care , that provided a framework for defining high-quality primary care and proposed 5 recommendations for implementing that definition. Using the report's framework, we identified health equity challenges and opportunities with examples from primary care systems in the United States and Canada. We are poised to reinvigorate primary care because the recent pandemic and the attention to continued racialized police violence sparked renewed conversations and collaborations around equity, diversity, inclusion, and health equity that have been long overdue. The time to transition those conversations to actionable items to improve the health of patients, families, and communities is now.Appeared as Annals "Online First" article.</ab>

        <ab>Local, regional, and national diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have been established to combat barriers to entry and promote retention in surgery residency programs. Our study evaluates changes in diversity in general surgery residency programs. We hypothesize that diversity trends have remained stable nationally and regionally.</ab>
        <ab>General surgery residents in all postgraduate years were queried regarding their self-reported sex, race, and ethnicity following the 2020 ABSITE. Residents were then grouped into geographic regions. Data were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square analyses.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 9276 residents responded. Nationally, increases in female residents were noted from 38.0 to 46.0% ( P &lt; .001) and in Hispanic or Latinx residents from 7.3 to 8.3% ( P = .031). Across geographic regions, a significant increase in female residents was noted in the Northwest (51.9 to 58.3%, P = .039), Midwest (36.9 to 43.3%, P = .006), and Southwest (35.8 to 47.5%, P = .027). A significant increase in black residents was only noted in the Northwest (0 to 15.8%, P = .031). The proportion of white residents decreased nationally by 8.9% and in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Southwest between 5.5 and 15.9% ( P &lt; .05).</ab>
        <ab>In an increasingly diverse society, expanding the numbers of underrepresented surgeons in training, and ultimately in practice, is a necessity. This study shows that there are region-specific increases in diversity, despite minimal change on a national level. This finding may suggest the need for region-specific DEI strategies and initiatives. Future studies will seek to evaluate individual programs with DEI plans and determine if there is a correlation to changing demographics.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The purpose of this study was to test a conceptual framework examining the interrelationships among campus climate, sense of belonging, anxiety, depression, and flourishing using a sample of Asian American graduate students. Methods: Secondary analysis of the Healthy Mind Study data from Fall 2019-Spring 2020 was conducted using a path analysis controlling for gender and perceptions of current financial situation as stressful. Results: Findings indicated that neither campus climate measured as perceptions of the climate for students from diverse backgrounds nor campus climate measured as perceptions of overall campus climate directly affected any of the outcome variables. Moreover, it was found that sense of belonging fully mediated the relationship between each campus climate and outcome variable. Conclusions: Sense of belonging is important to consider when evaluating campus climate and mental health outcomes among student populations. There are implications for college administrators responsible for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and programs.</ab>

        <ab>Initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in predominantly White contexts, including STEM fields, have primarily relied on approaches to increase the representation of minoritized individuals. However, an increase in the representation of minoritized individuals is only one step of the process, as the present study suggests that explicit beliefs about particular racial groups' abilities also matter. The present article examined whether classroom racial stereotype endorsement about science and math disadvantaged Black American adolescents relative to their White American peers. Across two longitudinal studies with 533 and 1,189 adolescents (N-adolescents = 1722; N-classrooms = 86; 45% Black American, 55% White American; 51% females; M-age = 13-14), classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement in the fall term predicted better science and math achievement scores for White American adolescents and lower science and math achievement scores for Black American adolescents at the end of the academic year. Student- and teacher-reported student engagement in science and math classrooms mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement and students' achievement scores. Results suggest that classrooms may be important conduits for communicating racial stereotypes that create racially hostile STEM learning environments. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Using a longitudinal sample of 1722 adolescents enrolled in 86 classrooms, the present study examined the consequences of classroom racial stereotype endorsement during adolescence. White American adolescents demonstrated favorable achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed traditional, or pro-White/anti-Black, stereotypes. Black American adolescents showed worse achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed pro-White/anti-Black stereotypes. Classroom engagement mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement and achievement scores for both Black and White American adolescents.</ab>

        <ab>The promotion of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is being increasingly pursued in health care, both in general and within radiation oncology. Because bibliometrics is a powerful tool to reveal the scientific literature on a specific topic during a certain timespan, a systematic bibliometric analysis of the documents published on EDI in radiation oncology was performed, aiming at exploring common patterns in research and emerging trends, tracking collaborations and networks, and anticipating future directions in clinical research. Standard descriptive statistics and bibliometric techniques were used in the analysis. A collaboration network and thematic map were generated from the data. Four domains were represented: (1) motor themes, including themes well developed and important for the structuring of the research field; (2) niche themes, representing the isolated topics that do not share important external links with other themes; (3) emerging themes, referring to still weakly developed topics; and (4) basic themes, including the essential topics. EDI in the profession of radiation oncology is essential to ensure that the workforce delivering radiation oncology care both draws from the full talent pool of human capital and delivers the highest quality science and clinical care to all patients. The burgeoning literature on EDI in radiation oncology suggests that a large and growing cohort of scholars within radiation oncology are dedicated to addressing these important challenges.</ab>

        <ab>To investigate United States (US) radiation oncology (RO) program directors' (PDs) attitudes and practices regarding racial/ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to better understand potential impact on underrepresented in medicine (UIM) residents in RO.</ab>
        <ab>A 28-item survey was developed using the validated Ethnic Harassment Experiences Scale and the Daily Life Experiences subscale, as well as input from DEI leaders in RO. The survey was IRB-approved and administered to RO PDs. PDs were provided with the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) definition of underrepresented in medicine (UIM), that is "Underrepresented in medicine means those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population." Descriptive statistics were used in analysis.</ab>
        <ab>The response rate was 71% (64/90). Institutional Culture and Beliefs: 42% responded that they had a department DEI director. A minority (17%, N=11) agreed "I believe that people from UIM backgrounds have equal access to quality tertiary education in the US." The majority (97%, N=62) agreed "My program values residents from UIM backgrounds." Support and Resources: Majority (78%, N=50) agreed "My program has resources in place to assist/provide support for resident physicians from UIM backgrounds." Interview and Recruitment: Most PDs (53%) had not taken part in activities aimed at recruiting UIM residents and 17% had interviewed no UIM applicants in the past 5 years for residency. Resident experiences of Racism: 17% (N=11) agreed "UIM residents in my program have reported incidents of racism to me," and 28% (N=18) agreed "I believe that UIM residents in my program have been treated differently because of their race/ethnicity by faculty, staff, co-residents or patients.".</ab>
        <ab>Most PDs reported that they did not believe that UIM residents were treated differently in their department because of their race/ethnicity, and only a minority had received reports of racial discrimination experienced by residents. These data are in contrast to resident experiences, and suggest a disconnect between DEI perceptions and resident experiences among US RO PDs that should be addressed through increased programmatic action and evaluation.</ab>

        <ab>Adhering to the paradigm of the natural sciences, much of undergraduate medical education (UME) in the United States remains committed to objectivity, compliance, and standardization in its approach to teaching, evaluation, student affairs, and accreditation practices. The authors argue that, while these simple and complicated problem solving (SCPS) approaches may be valid for some highly controlled environments of UME, they lack rigor in complex, real-world environments where optimal care and education is not standardized but is tailored to context and individual needs. This argument is supported by evidence that "systems" approaches, characterized by complex problem solving (CPS, differentiated from complicated problem solving), lead to better outcomes in patient care and student academic performance. Examples of interventions implemented at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine from 2011 to 2021 further illustrate this point. Interventions in student well-being that emphasize personal and professional growth have led to student satisfaction that is 20% higher than the national average on the Association of American Medical Colleges' Graduation Questionnaire (GQ). Career advising interventions that augment the use of adaptive behaviors in place of rules and guidelines have yielded 30% fewer residency applications per student than the national average while simultaneously yielding residency "unmatched" rates that are one-third of the national average. Regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion, an emphasis on civil discourse around real-world problems has been associated with student attitudes toward diversity that are 40% more favorable than the national average on the GQ. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of matriculating students who are underrepresented in medicine to 35% of the incoming class. The article concludes with a review of philosophic barriers to incorporating the CPS paradigm into UME and of notable pedagogic differences between CPS and SCPS approaches.</ab>

        <ab>An authentic, programmatic commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in plastic surgery is necessary to attract and retain a diverse workforce. Plastic surgery residency program websites and social media accounts are important sources of information about program values and culture for applicants, especially with the shift to virtual recruitment. Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether integrated plastic surgery residency programs address DEI through content on their websites and Instagram accounts.</ab>
        <ab>Integrated plastic surgery residency programs were identified through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in December 2021. We searched program websites and Instagram accounts for elements of DEI. We evaluated the impact of region, program director sex, and program director race on prevalence of DEI elements on websites using chi-squared tests.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 82 integrated plastic surgery residency programs were identified. Overall, 40 (48%) program websites had at least one DEI element, and 10 (12.2%) were found to have 3 or more DEI elements. The number of DEI elements per program website did not vary by region, program director sex, and program director ethnicity. Among programs with Instagram accounts, 49 (65.3%) posted about women, 30 (40.0%) posted about racial/ethnic minority groups, and 25 (33.3%) posted about LGBTQ+ identities.</ab>
        <ab>Despite widely heralded DEI efforts in plastic surgery residency recruitment, relatively few programs address DEI online. Programs looking to recruit diverse applicants could benefit from increased DEI content on their websites and social media accounts.</ab>

        <ab>Microaggressions are pervasive in daily life, including in undergraduate and graduate medical education and across health care settings. The authors created a response framework (i.e., a series of algorithms) to help bystanders (i.e., health care team members) become upstanders when witnessing discrimination by the patient or patient's family toward colleagues at the bedside during patient care, Texas Children's Hospital, August 2020 to December 2021.</ab>
        <ab>Similar to a medical "code blue," microaggressions in the context of patient care are foreseeable yet unpredictable, emotionally jarring, and often high-stakes. Modeled after algorithms for medical resuscitations, the authors used existing literature to create a series of algorithms, called Discrimination 911, to teach individuals how to intervene as an upstander when witnessing instances of discrimination. The algorithms "diagnose" the discriminatory act, provide a process to respond with scripted language, and subsequently support a colleague who was targeted. The algorithms are accompanied by training on communication skills and diversity, equity, and inclusion principles via a 3-hour workshop that includes didactics and iterative role play. The algorithms were designed in the summer of 2020 and refined through pilot workshops throughout 2021.</ab>
        <ab>As of August 2022, 5 workshops have been conducted with 91 participants who also completed the post-workshop survey. Eighty (88%) participants reported witnessing discrimination from a patient or patient's family toward a health care professional, and 89 (98%) participants stated that they would use this training to make changes in their practice.</ab>
        <ab>The next phase of the project will involve continued dissemination of the workshop and algorithms as well as developing a plan to obtain follow-up data in an incremental fashion to assess for behavior change. To reach this goal, the authors have considered changing the format of the training and are planning to train additional facilitators.</ab>

        <ab>The Ottawa Conference on the Assessment of Competence in Medicine and the Healthcare Professions was first convened in 1985 in Ottawa. Since then, what has become known as the Ottawa conference has been held in various locations around the world every 2 years. It has become an important conference for the community of assessment - including researchers, educators, administrators and leaders - to share contemporary knowledge and develop international standards for assessment in medical and health professions education.</ab>
        <ab>The Ottawa 2022 conference was held in Lyon, France, in conjunction with the AMEE 2022 conference. A diverse group of international assessment experts were invited to present a symposium at the AMEE conference to summarise key concepts from the Ottawa conference. This paper was developed from that symposium.</ab>
        <ab>This paper summarises key themes and issues that emerged from the Ottawa 2022 conference. It highlights the importance of the consensus statements and discusses challenges for assessment such as issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion, shifts in emphasis to systems of assessment, implications of 'big data' and analytics, and challenges to ensure published research and practice are based on contemporary theories and concepts.</ab>

        <ab>Organizational culture plays a major role in prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) objectives by aligning individual values of employees with organizational values. However, effective strategies to create an inclusive organizational culture, in which these values are aligned, remain unclear. The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) launched a qualitative study, as a follow-up of the previous project on DEI that highlighted low levels of inclusion and work engagement among radiation oncology (RO) professionals in Europe. The aim of the present study was to gain an understanding of how DEI could be improved within RO departments by creating a more inclusive organizational culture.</ab>
        <ab>A qualitative research study was conducted by enrolling RO professionals from 4 selected European countries through an open call on the ESTRO platform. Respondents who completed an online survey and met the inclusion criteria, such as experiencing low DEI levels at work, were invited for an online semistructured interview. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically with an abductive approach via concepts in relation to "DEI," "work engagement," "organizational culture," and "professional values."</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-six eligible respondents from Great Britain, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland were interviewed. The thematic analysis identified cases in which limited engagement at work emerged when the personal values of RO professionals conflicted with dominant organizational values, hampering DEI. Three conflicts were found between the following personal versus organizational values: (1) self-development versus efficiency, (2) togetherness versus competition, and (3) people-oriented versus task-oriented cultures.</ab>
        <ab>Awareness of how organizational values can conflict with professionals' values should be raised to improve inclusion and engagement in the workplace. Additionally, efforts should be focused on tackling existing power imbalances that hamper effective deliberation on organizational- versus personal-value conflicts.</ab>

        <ab>There are limited opportunities for mentorship for underrepresented in medicine (URM) trainees and physicians in radiation oncology (RO). The purpose of this study was to create and evaluate a formal mentorship program open to URMs and allies with interests in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>A mentorship program incorporating a virtual platform was designed by the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee. It was structured to include 6 sessions over 6 months with matched mentor-mentee pairs based on responses to a publicized online interest form. A compilation of evidence-based guidelines was provided to optimize the mentorship relationship. Linked pre- and postprogram surveys were administered to collect demographic data, define baseline goals and level of support, and evaluate program satisfaction.</ab>
        <ab>Thirty-five mentor-mentee pairs were matched; 31 mentees completed the preprogram survey and 17 completed the postprogram survey. Preprogram, only 3 mentees (9.7%) reported satisfaction with current mentorship and 5 (16%) reported mechanisms or mentorship in place at their program to support URMs. On the postprogram survey, mentees reported high satisfaction with areas of mentorship, mentor attributes, and the program overall. Opportunities for improvement include implementation of mechanisms to enhance communication with mentor-mentee pairs and maintain longitudinal engagement.</ab>
        <ab>In the first tailored mentorship program in RO for URMs and those with diversity, equity, and inclusion interests, our results demonstrate that there is self-reported interest for better mentorship for URMs in RO, and that a nationwide structured mentorship program can address participants' goals with high satisfaction. Program expansion could provide URMs and allies in RO more opportunities for career development and promote a greater sense of community and inclusion within the field.</ab>

Lastly, it ascertains barriers and priorities concerning health equity research, workforce development, CTSA consortium leadership, and clinical trials participation among respondents.</ab>
        <ab>A survey was administered to registrants of the virtual CTSA Program 2020 Fall Meeting. Respondents reported their roles, perceived importance of and commitment to improving DEI. Bivariate cross-tabulations and structural equation modeling examined associations between respondents' roles, perceived importance of DEI, and commitment to improving DEI. Grounded theory was used to code and analyze open-ended questions.</ab>
        <ab>Among 796 registrants, 231 individuals completed the survey. DEI was "extremely important" among 72.7 percent of respondents and lowest among UL1 PIs (66.7%). Being "extremely committed" to improving DEI was reported by 56.3 percent of respondents and lowest among "other staff" (49.6%). Perceived importance of DEI was positively associated with commitment to improve DEI. Institutional and CTSA Commitment, Support, and Prioritization of DEI represented a key theme for improving DEI among respondents.</ab>
        <ab>Clinical and translational science organizations must take bold steps to transform individual perceptions of DEI into commitment and commitment into action. Institutions must set visionary objectives spanning leadership, training, research, and clinical trials research to meet the promise and benefits of a diverse NIH-supported workforce.</ab>

        <ab>Remote patient monitoring (RPM), within the larger context of telehealth expansion, has been established as an effective and safe means of care for patients with heart failure (HF) during the recent pandemic. Of the demographic groups, female patients and black patients are underenrolled relative to disease distribution in clinical trials and are under-referred for RPM, including remote haemodynamic monitoring, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), wearables and telehealth interventions. The sex- and race-based disparities are multifactorial: stringent clinical trial inclusion criteria, distrust of the medical establishment, poor access to healthcare, socioeconomic inequities, and lack of diversity in clinical trial leadership. Notwithstanding addressing the above factors, RPM has the unique potential to reduce disparities through a combination of implicit bias mitigation and earlier detection and intervention for HF disease progression in disadvantaged groups. This review describes the uptake of remote haemodynamic monitoring, CIEDs and telehealth in female patients and black patients with HF, and discusses aetiologies that may contribute to inequities and strategies to promote health equity.</ab>

        <ab>Despite decades-long calls for increasing racial and ethnic diversity, the medical profession continues to exclude members of Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Indigenous groups.</ab>
        <ab>To describe US medical school admissions leaders' experiences with barriers to and advances in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study involved key-informant interviews of 39 deans and directors of admission from 37 US allopathic medical schools across the range of student body racial and ethnic composition. Interviews were conducted in person and online from October 16, 2019, to March 27, 2020, and analyzed from October 2019 to March 2021.</ab>
        <ab>Participant experiences with barriers to and advances in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>Among 39 participants from 37 medical schools, admissions experience ranged from 1 to 40 years. Overall, 56.4% of participants identified as women, 10.3% as Asian American, 25.6% as Black or African American, 5.1% as Hispanic or Latinx, and 61.5% as White (participants could report &gt;1 race and/or ethnicity). Participants characterized diversity broadly, with limited attention to racial injustice. Barriers to advancing racial and ethnic diversity included lack of leadership commitment; pressure from faculty and administrators to overemphasize academic scores and school rankings; and political and social influences, such as donors and alumni. Accreditation requirements, holistic review initiatives, and local policy motivated reforms but may also have inadvertently lowered expectations and accountability. Strategies to overcome challenges included narrative change and revision of school leadership structure, admissions goals, practices, and committee membership.</ab>
        <ab>In this qualitative study, admissions leaders characterized the ways in which entrenched beliefs, practices, and power structures in medical schools may perpetuate institutional racism, with far-reaching implications for health equity. Participants offered insights on how to remove inequitable structures and implement process changes. Without such action, calls for racial justice will likely remain performative, and racism across health care institutions will continue.</ab>

        <ab>Individuals have multiple intersecting identities, unique perspectives, and experiences which provide opportunities for new ways to interact, support inclusion and equity, and address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This commentary explores the diversity of the speech-language pathology workforce in Australia.</ab>
        <ab>A survey of Australian speech-language pathologists (SLPs; n  = 1,638) distributed in November and December 2021 explored personal characteristics and experiences of the workforce. Almost 30% of SLPs who responded reported having experiences or perspectives that were relevant to service users and a quarter described other lived experiences, which included disability, cultural and linguistic background, mental health, caring responsibilities, neurodiversity, and being LGBTQI+.</ab>
        <ab>This commentary affirms the value of diversity among allied health professions to enrich practice with individuals and communities. By understanding the diversity of the speech-language pathology workforce and perspectives of historically marginalised or invisible groups, the profession can introduce strategies to more meaningfully engage and support people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the workforce and enhance service equity and accessibility for people with communication and swallowing disabilities. This commentary focusses on SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10.</ab>

        <ab>Closing the diversity gap is critical to ensure equity in medical education and health care quality. Nevertheless, evidence-based strategies and best practices to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the biomedical workforce remain poorly understood and underused. To improve the culture of DEI in graduate medical education (GME), in 2020 the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) launched the Barbara Ross-Lee, DO, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Award to recognize exceptional DEI efforts in US residency programs.</ab>
        <ab>To identify strategies and best practices that exemplary US GME programs use to improve DEI.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study performed an exploratory content analysis of award applications submitted to the ACGME over 2 cycles in 2020 and 2021, using the constant comparative method. The research team first acknowledged their own biases related to DEI, used caution to not overinterpret the data, and performed several cross-checks during data analysis to ensure confirmability of the results. A preliminary codebook was developed and used during regular adjudication sessions. Disagreements were discussed until agreements were reached.</ab>
        <ab>Foundational (ie, commonly cited, high-impact, and small-effort strategies considered achievable by all programs) and aspirational (ie, potential for high impact but requiring greater effort and investment) DEI strategies used by exemplary GME programs.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study included 29 award applications submitted between August 17, 2020, and January 11, 2022. Strategies spanned the education continuum from premedical students through faculty. Foundational strategies included working with schools, community colleges, and 4-year college campuses; providing structured support for visiting students; mission-driven holistic review for admissions and selection; interviewer trainings on implicit bias mitigation and on how racism and discrimination impact admission processes and advancement; interview-day DEI strategies; inclusive selection and DEI committees; mission statements that include DEI; and retention efforts to improve faculty diversity. Aspirational strategies included development of longitudinal bidirectional collaborations (eg, articulation agreements, annual workshops, funded rotations and/or research) with organizations working with applicants who were historically excluded and underrepresented in medicine, blinding metrics in residency applications, longitudinal curricula on DEI and health equity, and faculty mentoring such as affinity groups, mentored research, and joint academic-community recruitments. Findings provide residency program leadership with a menu of options at various inflection points to foster DEI within their programs.</ab>
        <ab>The findings of this qualitative study suggest that GME programs might adopt strategies of exemplary programs to improve DEI in residency, ensure compliance with accreditation standards, and improve health outcomes for all.</ab>

        <ab>We sought to identify concepts that may facilitate National Collegiate Athletic Association efforts to assist member institutions in addressing the mental health needs of student-athletes of colour. A two-step process was followed to generate and refine concepts, guided by Delphi methodology. First, a scoping review was conducted, including original peer-reviewed research articles that quantified or qualitatively described determinant(s) of racial or ethnic differences in athlete mental health or mental healthcare. Next, a multiday virtual meeting was facilitated to review the results of the scoping review, discuss lived experiences and generate potential concepts. Participants included a racially and ethnically diverse group of student-athletes, medical and mental health professionals, athletics administrators, diversity, equity and inclusion experts, health educators and representatives from leading organisations involved in athlete mental health. Through the consensus process, participants identified 42 concepts that member institutions might consider implementing on their campuses. Concepts were largely focused on organisational policies and practices such as staffing diversity and inclusion, expanded options for clinical support (ie, identity-relevant support groups) and within-organisation accountability. Concepts related to specific areas for stakeholder education were also identified. Institutions have the potential to play an important role in supporting the mental well being of student-athletes of colour, and the present concepts can help inform institutional action. While concepts proposed are believed to be broadly relevant across athletics settings, they would need to be further considered and tailored to reflect setting-specific organisational structures, resources and needs.</ab>

        <ab>Orthopaedic surgery has the lowest proportion of women surgeons in practice of any specialty in the United States. Preliminary studies suggest that patients who are treated by physicians of the same race, ethnicity, cultural background, or gender feel more comfortable with their care and may have better outcomes. Therefore, understanding the discrepancies in the diversity of the orthopaedic surgeon workforce is crucial to addressing system-wide healthcare inequities.</ab>
        <ab>(1) Does a difference exist in gender representation among practicing orthopaedic surgeons across geographic distributions and years in practice? (2) Does a difference exist in gender representation among practicing orthopaedic surgeons with regard to rural-urban setting, group practice size, and years in practice?</ab>
        <ab>Orthopaedic surgeons serving Medicare patients in 2017 were identified in the Medicare Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File and Physician Compare national databases. This dataset encompasses more than 64% of practicing orthopaedic surgeons, providing a low proportion of missing data compared with other survey techniques. Group practice size, location, and Rural-urban Commuting Area scores were compared across physician gender and years in practice. Linear and logistic regressions modeled gender and outcomes relationships adjusted by years in practice. Least-square means estimates for outcomes were calculated by gender at the median years in practice (19 years) via regression models.</ab>
        <ab>According to the combined Medicare databases used, 5% (1019 of 19,221) of orthopaedic surgeons serving Medicare patients were women; this proportion increased with decreasing years in practice (R 2 0.97; p &lt; 0.001). Compared by region, the West region demonstrated the highest proportion of women orthopaedic surgeons overall (7% [259 of 3811]). The Midwest and South regions were below the national mean for proportions of women orthopaedic surgeons, both overall (5% [305 of 6666] and 5% [209 of 4146], respectively) and in the first 5 years of practice (9% [54 of 574] and 9% [74 of 817], respectively). Women worked in larger group practices than men (median [interquartile range] 118 physicians [20 to 636] versus median 56 [12 to 338]; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Both genders were more likely to practice in an urban setting, and when controlling for years in practice, there was no difference between men and women orthopaedic surgeons practicing in rural or urban settings (respectively, R 2 = 0.0004 and 0.07; p = 0.89 and 0.09).</ab>
        <ab>Among orthopaedic surgeons, there is only one woman for every 20 men caring for Medicare patients in the United States. Although gender representation is increasing longitudinally for women, it trails behind other surgical subspecialties substantially. Longitudinal mentoring programs, among other evidenced initiatives, should focus on the more pronounced underrepresentation identified in Midwestern/Southern regions and smaller group practices. Gender-based equity, inclusion, and diversity efforts should focus on recruitment strategies, and further research is needed to study how inclusion and diversity efforts among orthopaedic surgeons improves patient-centered care.</ab>

        <ab>Women and minorities remain under-represented in academic vascular surgery. This under-representation persists in the editorial peer review process which may contribute to publication bias. In 2020, the Journal of Vascular Surgery (JVS) addressed this by diversifying the editorial board and creating a new Editor of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The impact of a DEI editor on modifying the output of JVS has not yet been examined. We sought to determine the measurable impact of a DEI editor on diversifying perspectives represented in the journal, and on contributing to changes in the presence of DEI subject matter across published journal content.</ab>
        <ab>The authorship and content of published primary research articles, editorials, and special articles in JVS were examined from November 2019 through July 2022. Publications were examined for the year prior to initiation of the DEI Editor (pre), the year following (post), and from September 2021 to July 2022, accounting for the average 47-week time period from submission to publication in JVS (lag). Presence of DEI topics and women authorship were compared using χ 2 tests.</ab>
        <ab>During the period examined, the number of editorials, guidelines, and other special articles dedicated to DEI topics in the vascular surgery workforce or patient population increased from 0 in the year prior to 4 (16.7%) in the 11-month lag period. The number of editorials, guidelines, and other special articles with women as first or senior authors nearly doubled (24% pre, 44.4% lag; P = .31). Invited commentaries and discussions were increasingly written by women as the study period progressed (18.7% pre, 25.9% post, 42.6% lag; P = .007). The number of primary research articles dedicated to DEI topics increased (5.6% pre, 3.3% post, 8.1% lag; P = .007). Primary research articles written on DEI topics were more likely to have women first or senior authors than non-DEI specific primary research articles (68.0% of all DEI vs 37.5% of a random sampling of non-DEI primary research articles; P &lt; .001). The proportion of distinguished peer reviewers increased (from 2.8% in 2020 to 21.9% in 2021; P &lt; .001).</ab>
        <ab>The addition of a DEI editor to JVS significantly impacted the diversification of topics, authorship of editorials, special articles, and invited commentaries, as well as peer review participation. Ongoing efforts are needed to diversify subject matter and perspective in the vascular surgery literature and decrease publication bias.</ab>

        <ab>The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Common Program Requirements include training in caring for diverse populations and understanding social determinants of health. Our large pediatric residency program implemented a longitudinal equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>To explore pediatric residents' perspectives and experiences in our longitudinal EDI curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>We applied the holistic framework by Haji et al. to characterize the effect of our EDI curriculum. We conducted 4 focus groups from November 2019 to September 2020 with trained facilitators using a structured question guide. We approached all eligible senior residents (n = 87) via email to participate. Project members coded written notes and transcripts and analyzed data using inductive thematic analysis.</ab>
        <ab>26 pediatric senior residents participated either in person (n = 13) or online (n = 13). Themes emerged from domains of knowledge, attitudes and behavioral change. These included having: (1) increased knowledge surrounding EDI issues, (2) a framework and language to better engage in EDI efforts and (3) increased confidence interrupting bias and microaggressions. Additional themes demonstrated: an increased need for EDI education at the institutional level, the unique experiences of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) trainees, and systemic barriers to equitable care.</ab>
        <ab>A longitudinal EDI curriculum has the potential to influence individual trainees, their work, and perceptions of the broader institutions in which they operate. Residents recognized and valued the curriculum and felt driven to use this knowledge to ensure that institutional policies and practices led to equitable clinical care.</ab>

        <ab>This summary from the American Heart Association provides guidance for the provision of primary and subspecialty palliative care in pediatric congenital and acquired heart disease.</ab>
        <ab>A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2010 to December 2021. Seminal articles published before January 2010 were also included in the review. Human subject studies and systematic reviews published in English in PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Collaboration were included. Structure: Although survival for pediatric congenital and acquired heart disease has tremendously improved in recent decades, morbidity and mortality risks remain for a subset of young people with heart disease, necessitating a role for palliative care. This scientific statement provides an evidence-based approach to the provision of primary and specialty palliative care for children with heart disease. Primary and specialty palliative care specific to pediatric heart disease is defined, and triggers for palliative care are outlined. Palliative care training in pediatric cardiology; diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations; and future research directions are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Improving equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) within Canadian radiology is critical for optimal patient care and to reduce health disparities. Although there are increasing national EDI initiatives, there is a paucity of resources available to assist radiology departments as the culture of EDI evolves and faculty and institutions are expected to incorporate EDI in their practice. We present practical recommendations for radiology departments, radiology training programs, and individual radiologists wishing or mandated to improve EDI in the workplace. Actionable strategies for creating an environment that promotes EDI, attracting and supporting diverse trainees, and for how individual radiologists can be allies are presented. These EDI strategies are imperative to provide the best patient care and to strengthen the future of Canadian radiology.</ab>

        <ab>A revised version of the Multicultural Ideology Scale (rMCI) is currently being developed to measure endorsement of multiculturalism in different cultural contexts. This study, which is part of a wider cross-cultural research project, presents the first assessment of the rMCI scale in the German language. The measure aims to cover several attitudinal dimensions of multiculturalism, relevant to the integration of different ethnocultural groups: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. Two independent datasets were acquired from Germany ( N  = 382) and Luxembourg ( N  = 148) to estimate the factor structure of the rMCI using different confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The findings suggest that a four-factor solution, including Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity, was the best fit for the data. Most of these subscales demonstrated adequate psychometric properties (internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity). The four-factor model of the rMCI was partially invariant across the two ethnic groups and full measurement invariance was established across gender.</ab>

        <ab>Despite recent attention to social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion within medical education, little is currently known about whether and to what extent that attention has translated into the language of formal documents articulating organization purpose: medical school mission statements. Mission statements are the marquee declaration of a medical school's identity and purpose, and a recommended tool for applicants to determine "fit" when applying. This study examines whether and to what extent social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion have made it into the formal public statements of organizational purpose and identity over the last several years. Mission statements were extracted manually from the 2007, 2017, and 2021 AAMCs Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) database for both U.S. and Canadian M.D. granting medical schools. Then each mission statement version was coded for the presence and degree of diversity language including words like social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion using an agreed-upon lexicon. Frequencies and within school changes over time were analyzed. Among 139 medical schools with discoverable mission statements from 2007, 91% (n=127) changed their MSs between 2007 and 2021. In 2007, 24% (n=33) of MSs contained diversity language. By 2017 nearly half of MSs; 47% (n=65) contained any reference to such language. But by 2021, despite 46 school having changed their MSs again, only a few more included diversity language in their MSs (56%; n=77). The most common terms used were "diversity," followed by the increasing presence of words like "inclusion," "equity," and "justice" by 2021. Curiously, a few schools redacted diversity language from 2007 to 2021. A Diversity Thesaurus of 22 terms was iteratively identified, with all terms searched in all MSs. Overall, mission statement change was quite common with most medical schools making changes across the 14 years covered in this study. And despite a doubling of the number of medical schools MSs mentioning diversity over a 10-year period, that increase seemed to slow in recent years even among schools who had a chance to change their MS. As of mid-2021, two in five US medical schools still have no mention of diversity related language in their most formal, said articulation of organizational purpose.</ab>

        <ab>Racism and bias contribute to healthcare disparities at a patient and population health level and also contribute to the stagnation or even regression of progress toward equitable representation in the workforce and in healthcare leadership. Medical education and healthcare systems have expended tremendous efforts over the past several years to address these inequities. However, systemic racism continues to impact health outcomes and the future physician workforce. The Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics called for action to achieve a future free from racism in obstetrics and gynecology education and healthcare. As a result of this call to action, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Guidelines Task Force was created. The mission of the Task Force was to support educators in their efforts to identify and create educational materials that augment antiracist educational goals and prepare, recruit, and retain a talented and diverse workforce. In this Special Report, the authors share these guidelines that describe best practices and set new standards to increase diversity, foster inclusivity, address systemic racism, and eliminate bias in obstetrics and gynecology educational products, materials, and environments.</ab>

        <ab>Achieving parity in representation within the field of Interventional Radiology (IR) across women and specific subsets of minority groups has been a challenge. The lack of a strongly diverse physician workforce in gender, race, and ethnicity suggests suboptimal recruitment after, during as well prior to IR training. There is a dearth of studies which effectively characterize the national demographic trends of the evolving IR workforce. This has prevented an accurate appraisal of continuing efforts to narrow the gaps in physician workforce diversity across the field of IR. To support these needs, this article illustrates historic trends while providing contemporary data that canvasses the status of diversity within the current IR physician and IR trainee workforce. It highlights the representation of those individuals historically underrepresented in medicine as well as women. It also highlights current obstacles to achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion within the field of IR as well as existing efforts that have been employed to mitigate this gap.</ab>

        <ab>Despite efforts toward equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic ophthalmology faculties, gender disparity continues to exist. Current evidence indicates that female ophthalmologists consistently hold lower academic ranks and receive less funding from the National Institutes of Health compared to their male colleagues. The extent of this disparity is unknown in the Canadian context. We sought to characterize the gender gap in Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding among ophthalmologists. From inception, funding decision data were collected from the official Canadian Institutes of Health Research website database hosted by the Government of Canada. Measures including gender, number of grants held over the study period, number of simultaneous grants, and total funding were collected. Female ophthalmologists were consistently awarded fewer grants (21.43 percent) compared to male counterparts and were less likely to hold multiple grants since 2008. An over five-fold disparity was found in total funding for female compared to male ophthalmologists. As well, females were less likely than males to hold a grant in each particular year except in 2020. Female ophthalmologists continue to face barriers to attaining academic support from Canadian Institute of Health Research funds. Continued action to mitigate this gender gap may improve gender-based parity in federal research funding.</ab>

        <ab>In 2021, the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP) conducted its first equity, diversity, and inclusion Climate Survey. The membership's experiences of inclusion, belonging, professional opportunities, discrimination, microaggressions, racism, and harassment in their professional lives are presented.</ab>
        <ab>The ethics-reviewed survey was distributed in English and French to full members of COMP. Participants responded to questions covering demographics and professional climate. Simple descriptive statistics were used to measure frequency of responses. Data pertaining to impressions on the climate within the profession were compared using nonparametric statistical tests.</ab>
        <ab>The survey was distributed to 649 eligible members; 243 (37%) responded, and 214 (33%) provided full response sets. From the full response sets, findings showed that in general, age, highest academic degree, and racial and ethnic distribution trends of medical physicists were comparable with previously collected data and/or the Canadian population. The experiences of respondents relating to harassment in the workplace and perception of climate are reported and provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of interventions or training programs. In the workplace, fewer women (58%) reported having professional opportunities compared with men (70%). The survey also found that 17% of respondents (most of whom were women) directly or indirectly experienced sexual harassment in the workplace within the past 5 years. Finding that 23% of survey respondents identified as having a disability is a valuable reminder that accommodations in the workplace are necessary for more than 1 in every 5 medical physicists working in clinics.</ab>
        <ab>This study provided insight into the diversity and experiences of medical physicists in Canada. The majority of respondents had positive perceptions about their professional environment. However, equity-lacking groups were identified, such as women, underrepresented minorities, Indigenous peoples, and people with visible and invisible disabilities.</ab>

        <ab>Caring for patients with personality disorders can be challenging due to risks associated with suicidal ideation, homicidal threats, splitting, and acting out with problematic behavior in psychiatric inpatient units. Limited resources on inpatient units further add to the stress and burden on staff. This case summarizes how trauma-informed care was implemented in an inpatient setting to produce marked improvement in a patient's treatment outcomes as well as better staff engagement and satisfaction. This culture change in the approach to care was not an easy process, as effortful planning and resources were required for key elements such as ongoing coaching, education, and regular staff debriefings. This case report signals the need for service providers to enable health systems to examine rules and exceptions from a cultural perspective of considering equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)-to allow openness to rational exceptions, even if they are unconventional.</ab>

        <ab>Health scholars have been enthusiastic in critique of health inequities, but comparatively silent on the ways in which our own institutions, and our actions within them, recreate and retrench systems of oppression. The behaviour of health scholars within academic institutions have far reaching influences on the health-related workforce, the nature of evidence, and the policy solutions within our collective imaginations. Progress on health equity requires moving beyond platitudes like 'equity, diversity and inclusion' statements and trainings towards actually being and doing differently within our day-to-day practices. Applying complex systems change theory to identify, examine and shift mental models, or habits of thought (and action), that are keeping us stuck in our efforts to advance health equity is a promising approach. This paper introduces five common mental models that are preventing meaningful equity-oriented systems transformation within academia and offers ideas for shifting them towards progressively more productive, and authentic, actions by health scholars to advance health equity across systems.</ab>

        <ab>The handling of incidental findings (IFs) in brain imaging studies has been a source of contention among scientists and bioethicists. A conceptual framework informed by diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and distributive justice approaches, namely EUSTICE, is proposed for the ethical handling and reporting of IFs in brain imaging research. I argue that EUSTICE provides a systematic and inclusive approach to addressing the ethical conundrum around IF disclosure and managing IFs proportionately and sensitively in brain imaging research. The EUSTICE framework may have implications for the field of neurosciences or human studies broadly in guiding ethics of IFs in research.</ab>

        <ab>The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting is one of the primary venues for radiation oncologists to present new research, network, and share innovations. In this brief report, we describe the racial representation of invited physician speakers at the Annual Meeting relative to the specialty.</ab>
        <ab>The program list of all invited educational sessions and panel speakers in the ASTRO annual meetings from 2021 was accessed via the ASTRO website. Race was determined by a combination of facial recognition and Internet investigation. Speakers and panels were divided by race and specialty. Underrepresented in medicine (URiM) was defined as Black race and/or Hispanic ethnicity.</ab>
        <ab>We identified 182 cumulative speaking panels at the 2021 ASTRO annual meeting and 960 individuals who filled these panels. The majority of speakers were of White race (57%), followed by Asian race (34.2%). URiM speakers made up approximately 8.6% of speakers and were mostly congregated in diversity, equity, and inclusion in health care (DEI) panels. A total of 15.6% of panels were White-only, and 14.8% of panels had at least 1 URiM member. URiM race speakers were mostly congregated in DEI panels, comprising 44.9% of DEI speaker positions and 4.1% of non-DEI speaker positions; this difference reached statistical significance ( P &lt; .0001).</ab>
        <ab>The proportion of underrepresented minorities receiving panel invitations at ASTRO remains minimal and is virtually nonexistent outside of DEI-related panels. Targeted efforts to increase URiM representation will be needed to make tangible progress on this issue, just as they have yielded progress on increasing gender diversity in panel invitations.</ab>

        <ab>As a discipline, communication sciences and disorders (CSD) has struggled to address equity and inclusion for students, professionals, and scholars from historically excluded racial groups. Recent publications in this periodical that have begun to confront systemic racism in the discipline have been met with some expected resistance. In this commentary, I attempt to support and expand an argument made by Ellis and Kendall (2021), namely, that systemic racism has been and continues to be a normal and persistent feature of our academic programs. A comparison to U.S. Census data suggests that Asian, Black, Indigenous, Native, Latino/a/e, and multiracial CSD professionals are represented to a drastically lower rate compared with their representation in the population at large. Furthermore, publicly available data summaries indicate that there is a reduction in the level of racial diversity that is associated with an increase in White representation across the entire progression of the professional training and certification process, with the greatest level of diversity at the undergraduate level followed by the graduate and professional levels.</ab>
        <ab>A general knowledge of social and legal history in the United States would suggest that the relative reduction in representation across the academic and professional levels of the CSD disciplines results from policy and practice patterns that serve to preserve a White-dominant culture in our profession and exclude People of Color. Continued efforts broadly based in critical race studies may prove as a useful tool to identify, confront, and transform current policy and practice patterns in our national organization, academic programs, and accrediting bodies that have produced and sustained levels of inequality and White dominance in our programs and disciplines.</ab>

        <ab>To develop a measure for fair inclusion in pivotal trials by assessing transparency and representation of enrolled women, older adults (aged 65 years and older), and racially and ethnically minoritized patients.</ab>
        <ab>Retrospective cross sectional study.</ab>
        <ab>Sponsors of novel oncology therapeutics that were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration over 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2017.</ab>
        <ab>Trial data from Drugs@FDA, ClinicalTrials.gov, and corresponding publications; cancer incidence demographics from US Cancer Statistics and the American Cancer Society.</ab>
        <ab>Transparency measures assess whether trials publicly report participant sex, age, and racial and ethnic identity. Representation measures assess whether trial participant demographics represent more than 80% of the US patient population for studied conditions, calculated by dividing the percentage of study participants in each demographic subgroup by the percentage of the US cancer population with the studied condition per group. Composite fair inclusion measures assess average transparency and representation scores, overall and for each demographic group. Results are reported at the trial, product, and sponsor levels.</ab>
        <ab>Between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2017, the FDA approved 59 novel cancer therapeutics, submitted by 25 sponsors (all industry companies) on the basis of 64 pivotal trials. All 25 sponsors (100%) reported participant sex, 10 (40%) reported age, and six (24%) reported race and ethnicity. Although 14 (56%) sponsors had adequate representation of women in trials, only six (24%) adequately represented older adults, and four (16%) adequately represented racially and ethnically minoritized patients (black, Asian, Hispanic or Latinx). On overall fair inclusion, one sponsor scored 100% and the median sponsor score was 81% (interquartile range 75-87%). More than half of sponsors (13 (56%) of 25) fairly included women, 20% (n=5) fairly included older adults, and 4% (n=1) fairly included racially and ethnically minoritized patients in trials. 80% of product had pivotal trials that fairly included women, 24% fairly included older adults, and 5% fairly included racially and ethnically minoritized patients.</ab>
        <ab>This novel approach evaluates trials, products, and sponsors on their fair inclusion of demographic groups in research. For oncology trials, substantial room was noted for improved inclusion of older adults and patients who identify as black or Latinx and transparency around the number of participants identifying as Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Alaska Native. These measures can be used by sponsors, ethics committees, among others, to set and evaluate trial diversity goals to help spur progress toward greater research equity in the US.</ab>

        <ab>Formalizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles and practices in health sciences libraries should be an organizational goal. Organizations should strive to build and sustain a culture of equity and inclusion in which diversity is integrated into their core operations. Health sciences libraries should design systems, policies, procedures, and practices that align with and support these principles in collaboration with partners and stakeholders that share these values. The authors used DEI terminology to search the websites of various health sciences libraries for DEI-related job posts, committee work, and activities as a source of information on the present level of DEI activity in health sciences libraries.</ab>

        <ab>Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) research has advanced gene and biomarker technologies to aid identification of individuals at risk for dementia. This innovation is a lynchpin in development of disease-modifying therapies. The emerging science could transform outcomes for patients and families. However, current limitations in the racial representation and inclusion of racial diversity in research limits the relevance of these technologies: AD/ADRD research cohorts used to define biomarker cutoffs are mostly White, despite clinical and epidemiologic research that shows Black populations are among those experiencing the greatest burdens of AD/ADRD. White cohorts alone are insufficient to characterize heterogeneity in disease and in life experiences that can alter AD/ADRD's courses. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has called for increased racial diversity in AD/ADRD research. While scientists are working to implement NIA's plan to build more diverse research cohorts, they are also seeking out opportunities to consider race in AD/ADRD research. Recently, scientists have posed two ways of including race in AD/ADRD research: ancestry-based verification of race and race-based adjustment of biomarker test results. Both warrant careful examination for how they are impacting AD/ADRD science with respect to specific study objectives and the broader mission of the field. If these research methods are not grounded in pursuit of equity and justice, biases they introduce into AD/ADRD science could perpetuate, or even worsen, disparities in AD/ADRD research and care.</ab>

        <ab>Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important social determinant of health inequities that has been linked to chronic conditions, including osteoporosis, but research tends to focus on socioeconomic disadvantage rather than how socioeconomic advantage may facilitate these inequities. This study accounts for structural inequities and assesses the relationship between early-life and later-life SES, and risk of osteoporosis diagnosis. Data come from the nationally representative, population-based cohort Health and Retirement Study and include individuals ages 50 to 90. The outcome variable is osteoporosis diagnosis. Logistic regression models of the relationship between SES and osteoporosis diagnosis are estimated, accounting for demographic, health, and childhood variables. Higher levels of childhood and adult SES link to lower odds of osteoporosis diagnosis. Structural inequities in income and underdiagnosis of osteoporosis among persons identifying as Black/African American were detected. Accounting for bone density scan access, inequities in osteoporosis diagnosis appear to stem from barriers to accessing health care due to financial constraints. The important role of SES and evidence of structural inequities leading to underdiagnosis suggest the critical importance of clinicians receiving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training to reduce health inequities.</ab>

        <ab>Gender parity has been reached in graduation rates from medical school, yet women in medicine continue to face obstacles in promotion, compensation and opportunities, leading to leadership inequity, higher burnout and lower engagement. These complex issues with gender are just one aspect of the wide challenges related to diversity, equity and inclusion among medical professionals. While there are no "one size fits all" approaches, psychologists are well positioned to lead efforts related to promoting leadership equity, reducing burnout and raising engagement because of their training in communication skills, programmatic development and empathetic listening. This paper details several evidence-based efforts in which psychologists can lead in these ongoing issues for women in medicine.</ab>

        <ab>This response to Campbell et al. makes three points. First, the commitment to "know more" must examine the full ecology of relationship violence and sexual misconduct (RVSM); that knowledge is essential for creating multilevel prevention strategies. Second, a full realization of an intersectional perspective requires attention to a broader range of power-based harms, forging institutional links between RVSM prevention and work on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Third, while support for survivors is certainly vital, most people who experience harm do not report it, and so an ambitious approach to prevention is vital to building communities in which everyone can thrive.</ab>

        <ab>Since 2015, interest in the benefits of outdoor play for physical, emotional, social and environmental health, well-being and development has been growing in Canada and elsewhere.</ab>
        <ab>This scoping review aims to answer the question, "How, and in what context, is children's and youth's outdoor play being studied in Canada?" Included were studies of any type on outdoor play published after September 2015 in English or French by authors from Canadian institutions or assessing Canadian children and/or youth. Articles retrieved from MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus by March 2021 were organized according to eight priority areas: health, well-being and development; outdoor play environments; safety and outdoor play; cross-sectoral connections; equity, diversity and inclusion; professional development; Indigenous Peoples and land-based outdoor play; and COVID-19. Within each priority, study design and measurement method were tallied.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 275 articles included, the most common priority area was health, wellbeing and development (n = 239). The least common priority areas were COVID-19 (n = 9) and Indigenous Peoples and land-based outdoor play (n = 14). Cross-sectional studies were the most common; the least common were rapid reviews. Sample sizes varied from one parent's reflections to 999 951 data points from health databases. More studies used subjective than objective measurement methods. Across priorities, physical health was the most examined outcome, and mental/emotional development the least.</ab>
        <ab>A wealth of knowledge on outdoor play in Canada has been produced since 2015. Further research is needed on the relationship between outdoor play and mental/emotional development among children and youth.</ab>

        <ab>High-impact practices (HIPs) are educational modalities that focus on experiential and deep learning to affect student success in higher education, particularly among students matriculating from historically underserved communities. HIPs are designed to provide students with the intellectual and practical skills to succeed in an increasingly unstable global world beyond college. Utilizing a private-public partnership forensic archeological contract project, this paper examines how this venture employed a HIP-based contractor model that hired students as a professional archeological field crew and provided them with a living wage, transportation, and room and board. It also provided students without the means to participate in international fieldwork with the wherewithal to do so, supporting underserved students and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. Utilizing this HIP-based contract model resulted in greater student investment and collaboration in a fieldwork situation more akin to the real world, where students learned to solve problems, communicate, and network in an international setting, resulting in new opportunities, such as professional jobs, and academic projects and publications. The paid contractor model ensured students with limited resources could participate, broadening the type of student who can receive this type of training, expanding diversity in forensic anthropology. These models are not limited to forensic archeological fieldwork; they can also be applied to forensic anthropology laboratory projects. Utilizing HIPs and employing a more equitable contractor model contributes to student professionalization, strengthens professional prospects beyond the university, and contributes to DEIB initiatives, all of which benefit forensic anthropology as a subdiscipline.</ab>

        <ab> The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic severely threatened all aspects of academic family medicine, constituting a crisis. Multiple publications have identified recommendations and documented the creative responses of primary care and academic organizations to address these challenges, but there is little research on how decisions came about. Our objective was to gain insight into the context, process, and nature of family medicine leaders' discussions in pivoting to address a crisis.</ab>
        <ab> We used a qualitative descriptive design to explore new dimensions of existing concepts. The setting was the academic family medicine department at the University of Toronto. To identify leadership themes, we used the constant comparative method to analyze transcripts of monthly meetings of the departmental executive: three meetings immediately before and three following the declaration of a state emergency in Ontario.</ab>
        <ab> Six themes were evident before and after the onset of the pandemic: building capacity in academic family medicine; developing leadership; advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion; learner safety and wellness; striving for excellence; and promoting a supportive and collegial environment. Five themes emerged as specific responses to the crisis: situational awareness; increased multidirectional communication; emotional awareness; innovation in education and patient care; and proactive planning for extended adaptation to the pandemic.</ab>
        <ab> Existing cultural and organizational approaches formed the foundation for the crisis response, while crisis-specific themes reflected skills and attitudes that are essential in clinical family medicine, including adapting to community needs, communication, and emotional awareness.</ab>

        <ab>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a widespread shift to telehealth, there is an increased need to understand how we can best provide Telesupervision (TS). To help address the limited research on TS in the Marriage and family therapy (MFT) field, the present study seeks to describe the experiences of faculty telesupervisors who have provided TS as part of an online COAMFTE Accredited MFT master's program since 2012 (telesupervision was provided before accreditation since 2005). Eighteen participants completed individual interviews or focus groups, which were analyzed using descriptive phenomenological procedures. Our results describe the essential structure of faculty supervisors' experiences providing TS. Core themes include: general experiences with TS as a modality, online university-specific experiences with TS as a modality, a systemic lens is intentionally applied, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are intentionally addressed, and clinical competencies and ethics are intentionally addressed. A discussion of the essential experiences of faculty TS along with implications for clinical training and future research are reviewed.</ab>

        <ab>Anti-Black racism is a specific form of racism directed at Black people. In healthcare, there are poignant examples of anti-Black racism in the recruitment, selection, and retention stages of the job cycle. Research shows that anti-Black racism is associated with inequitable work outcomes and the under-representation of Black physicians. However, empirical findings are scattered with no organizing framework to consolidate these findings. To add to the literature, in this paper we present the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model (Schneider, 1987) as an organizing framework to discuss Black physicians' experiences with anti-Black racism and discrimination throughout their careers. We draw from previous literature to highlight specific experiences of Black physicians at each stage of the job cycle (i.e., attraction, selection, retention), and we offer considerations on how practitioners can mitigate anti-Black racism throughout the job cycle. In the wake of COVID-19 and highly publicized social justice movements, healthcare systems are seeking ways to increase the recruitment, selection, and retention of Black physicians to ensure health equity. We believe this guide will be valuable to practitioners, leaders, researchers, and program directions seeking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion of Black physicians in their healthcare systems. We conclude by providing practical implications and directions for future research.</ab>

        <ab>The veterinary medical profession-including in marine biology and oceanography, ecology, conservation science, and zoo, wildlife, aquatic, and exotic animal medicine-suffers from a well-known lack of diversity. It is the author's view that in order to ensure that animals (and plants) have the environment they need to thrive, and to address urgent ecosystem health and conservation issues in our global interconnected communities, our wildlife, zoo, and conservation science organizations must embrace diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB). Just as biodiversity is critical for the health and vitality of our ecosystem, the diversity of the people who care for those ecosystems will protect the health and vibrancy of our professions and organizations. Though research may not yet have established a direct link between the diversification of such organizations and the advancement of biodiversity, that does not mean there is no such effect or impact. With myriad evidence that diverse organizations are better at solving complex problems, why would there be an expectation that these professions would fare differently? A call to action is for such organizations to conduct and publish research regarding the impact of increased human diversity on their missions of enhancing biodiversity. The challenges to biodiversity are great, and our organizations must use every tool in the toolkit to find solutions-including enhancing DEIB. This article elaborates on the many benefits that come with prioritizing DEIB in our organizations-similar to those benefits arising from healthy, biodiverse ecosystems. Potential action steps are shared that organizations and associations may consider in promoting DEIB and igniting progress.</ab>

        <ab>Equity, in broad terms, is a critical issue and has been identified as an area that needs particular attention in academic medicine. Gender equity, as a subset of overall equity, has equally been shown to be lacking in academic medicine, and most medical schools and academic health systems are involved in substantive journeys to improve all dimensions of equity, diversity, and inclusion. This Invited Commentary calls for including gender-based salary equity as a foundational accomplishment for institutions seeking to achieve overall equity. In addition, the authors provide evidence and recommendations to guide institutions toward best practices in achieving salary equity. They propose 4 areas of consideration: (1) prioritization by leadership; (2) prioritization of resources to ensure success; (3) development of corrective action plans which are "automatic" and based on clear guidelines; and (4) transparency of methodology, data, and results.</ab>

        <ab>At a systemic level, organizations need to take intentional steps to build inclusion, equity, and diversity at all levels. In accordance with this need, organizations have been catalyzed by national conversations surrounding gender and racial/ethnic discrimination to generate sustainable change that addresses the disenfranchisement of women and racial/ethnic minorities. Although progress toward addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate these inequities has been made in recent years, research indicates that underrepresentation at the leadership level persists in academic medicine. Further, those in more senior roles are more likely to select, sponsor, and/or mentor individuals like themselves, thereby depriving minority populations of experiences directly correlated with career development and advancement. Hence, the authors posit a focus on the characteristics and competencies of a leader along with a structured selection process is an effective intervention to reduce bias and support inclusion by recalibrating the representation of leadership within academic medical centers. To this end, the authors developed a sequential 8-step leader selection process informed by their model of leadership characteristics and competencies. This process includes a policy update, selection of interview panels, training of panelists, screening the candidate pool, structured interview guides, final candidate slates, assessments of final candidates, and development of newly selected leaders. By following this process, the authors' organization has seen an increase in the representation of women and racial/ethnic minority leaders, an increase in employees' favorable perceptions specific to representation, and data indicative of developing and maintaining an internal diverse leadership candidate pipeline. Ultimately, inclusion makes stronger and more resilient organizations. By following a standardized process grounded in leadership characteristics and competencies, academic medical centers can see changes in their leadership that mirror the populations they lead and serve. Using such processes can lead to the kind of systemic change needed to create inclusive environments.</ab>

        <ab>The concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion are fundamental and more recently heavily discussed within medicine, research, and the larger society. There is increasing awareness that diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and backgrounds yields stronger teams and more effective results. There is also increasing awareness that stark inequities from systemic, institutional, and individual levels exist that limit the baseline opportunities for many populations. To close disparity gaps, broad aspects of diversity and promoting equity are required and efforts must be inclusive of those most marginalized. In this Clinical Commentary, we discuss, "How and If progress has been made in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion within the field of Allergy/Asthma/Immunology in the past decade?" We discuss the current state of clinical practice and what has been revealed over the past 10 years; describe our current workforce and what progress has or has not occurred there; and finally, review the state of scientific and medical research.</ab>

        <ab>Curriculum initiatives that provide the societal context of engineering practice can contribute to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) within the profession, as well as within the communities served by engineers. JEDI curriculum can foster diversity and inclusion by acknowledging and addressing social justice issues, providing a safe and inclusive space for students' voices to be heard, and advancing a productive dialogue within their institution of higher learning. Furthermore, such curriculum initiatives can empower students with the theoretical frameworks, analytical tools, and knowledge base to recognize and address ethical challenges and opportunities related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in their field. This Teaching Tips paper offers a description of a pilot program to incorporate JEDI material within a core bioengineering course modeled on evidence-based curriculum programs to embed ethics within technical courses. The author and collaborators sought to achieve two aims with the JEDI-focused material: (1) for students to learn how justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion intersect with bioengineering practice through an interdisciplinary lens of history, philosophy, sociology and anthropology which provide strong scholarly frameworks and theoretical foundations and (2) for students to participate in and foster an inclusive environment within their own educational institution through effectively communicating about these topics with each other. At the conclusion of the semester, a student survey indicated an overwhelmingly positive reception of the material. This paper will discuss the interdisciplinary curriculum development initiative, how the learning objectives were addressed by the specific lesson plans, and challenges to be addressed to create a sustainable educational model for the program.</ab>

        <ab>The pandemic era has wrought disruptive changes across all aspects of academic medicine, transforming clinical care systems, research enterprises, and educational practices. Among these sweeping changes, some of the most significant for Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery (OHNS) relate to innovative use of virtual communication. The virtual landscape has not only redefined the delivery of patient care but also expanded educational interactions across the career continuum. As the architecture of relationships has been reimagined, the traditional Halstedian teaching paradigm has evolved, now integrating in-person, virtual, and hybrid learning. Once formidable barriers to distance learning have diminished, giving way to social networks that support mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship. Creative use of technology supports collaboration, feedback, spaced learning, scaffolding, and interleaving. These advances have immediate significance for OHNS, a highly collaborative specialty that leads in technological innovation and aspires to improve diversity. Whereas traditional efforts to grow the ranks of underrepresented in medicine (URiM) individuals in OHNS yielded only incremental progress, the virtual landscape is unveiling new strategies for reengineering narrow or leaky pipelines. Strategies that can help attract URiM applicants include inclusive departmental web presence, interactive online clinical experiences, virtual interviews, and remote research opportunities. As students, surgeons, and scientists collectively embrace technology, accelerated progress toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) becomes possible. Maximizing these opportunities requires aligning national and institutional imperatives for diversity with departmental priorities and mission. Finally, intentional outreach and holistic assessment support growth of structured virtual communities that foster equitable access for those who need it most.</ab>

        <ab>Data from digital health technologies (DHT), including wearable sensors like Apple Watch, Whoop, Oura Ring, and Fitbit, are increasingly being used in biomedical research. Research and development of DHT-related devices, platforms, and applications is happening rapidly and with significant private-sector involvement with new biotech companies and large tech companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Uber) investing heavily in technologies to improve human health. Many academic institutions are building capabilities related to DHT research, often in cross-sector collaboration with technology companies and other organizations with the goal of generating clinically meaningful evidence to improve patient care, to identify users at an earlier stage of disease presentation, and to support health preservation and disease prevention. Large research consortia, cross-sector partnerships, and individual research labs are all represented in the current corpus of published studies. Some of the large research studies, like NIH's All of Us Research Program, make data sets from wearable sensors available to the research community, while the vast majority of data from wearable sensors and other DHTs are held by private sector organizations and are not readily available to the research community. As data are unlocked from the private sector and made available to the academic research community, there is an opportunity to develop innovative analytics and methods through expanded access. This Session solicited research results leveraging digital health technologies, including wearable sensor data, describing novel analytical methods, and issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) of both the underlying research data sets and the community of researchers working in this area. We particularly encouraged submissions describing opportunities for expanding and democratizing academic research using data from wearable sensors and related digital health technologies.</ab>

        <ab>More than ever, it is important to consider inclusion and diversity in rheumatology research. We reviewed and synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Canada with the aim of characterizing participants and identifying how determinants of health inequities are reported.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley framework. We searched Medline (1990 to December 2021), Embase (1990 to December 2021), and CENTRAL (inception to December 2021) for articles meeting inclusion criteria of: 1) used an RCT design; 2) evaluated pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic interventions; 3) included participants with RA; and 4) conducted in Canada. Data extraction was guided by the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group's PROGRESS-Plus framework on determinants that lead to health inequities (e.g., place of residence; race; occupation; gender/sex; religion; education; socioeconomic status; and social capital).</ab>
        <ab>Of 6,290 unique records, 42 were eligible for inclusion. We grouped studies according to 3 time periods: before 2000; 2000-2010; and 2011 to present. Participants of included studies were mostly middle-aged, female, and White. Sex and age were the most widely reported determinants in 41 studies. Other determinants reported were race (15 studies), education (11 studies), socioeconomic status (7 studies), and occupation (6 studies). Religion, features of relationships, and time-dependent relationships were not reported in any study.</ab>
        <ab>This scoping review suggests limited reporting on determinants of health inequities in RCTs for RA in Canada. Establishing reporting standards for equity factors in RCTs is important for addressing health inequities and informing accessible research and care for patients with RA.</ab>

        <ab>As organizations take on grand challenges in gender equality, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ protections and workplace inclusion, many well-intentioned individuals from dominant groups (e.g., cisgender men, Caucasian, heterosexual) are stepping forward as allies toward underrepresented or marginalized group members (e.g., cisgender women, People of Color, LGBTQ+ identified employees). Past research and guidance assume an inevitable need for external motivation, reflected in the 'business case' for diversity and in top-down policies to drive equity and inclusion efforts. This qualitative study explored internal motivations in the form of morally motivated virtues of 25 peer-nominated exemplary allies serving in leadership positions. In-depth life/career story interviews were used to identify the virtues that supported their allyship journeys. Findings demonstrated that they tapped into several virtues that served distinct functions in a 4-stage allyship development process: Stage 1-Energizing psychological investment (compassion, fairness); Stage 2-Thinking through allyship-relevant complexities (intellectual humility, perspective-taking, wisdom); Stage 3-Initiating action (prudence, moral courage, honesty); Stage 4-Committing to allyship (perseverance, patience). We call this the 'EThIC model of virtue-based allyship development.' This study has implications for theory and research on a virtue-based approach to diversity, equity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Bias and discrimination remain pervasive in the medical field and increase the risk of burnout, mental health disorders, and medical errors. The experiences of APSA members with bias and discrimination are unknown, therefore the APSA committee on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion conducted a survey to characterize the prevalence of bias and discrimination.</ab>
        <ab>1558 APSA members were sent an anonymous survey, of which 423 (27%) responded. Respondents were asked about their demographics, knowledge of implicit bias, and experience of bias and discrimination within their primary workplace, APSA, and APSA committees. Data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multivariable logistic regression as appropriate with significance defined as p&lt;0.05.</ab>
        <ab>Discrimination was reported across all levels of practice, academic appointments, race, ethnicity, and gender identities. On multivariable analysis, surgical trainees (OR 3.6) as well as Asian American and Pacific Islander (OR 4.8), Black (OR 5.2), Hispanic (OR 8.2) and women (OR 8.7) surgeons were more likely to experience bias and discrimination in the workplace. Community practice surgeons were more likely to experience discrimination within APSA committees (OR 3.6). Members identifying as Asian (OR 0.4), or women (OR 0.6) were less likely to express comfort reporting instances of bias and discrimination.</ab>
        <ab>Workplace discrimination exists across all training levels, academic appointments, and racial and gender identities. Trainees and racial- and gender-minority surgeons report disproportionately high prevalence of bias and discrimination. Improving reporting mechanisms and implicit bias training are possible initiatives in addressing these findings.</ab>

        <ab>In response to calls to achieve racial equity, racism has been declared as a public health crisis. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is an approach public health organizations are pursuing to address racial inequities in health. However, public health workforce perceptions about organizational commitment to DEI have not yet been assessed. Using a nationally representative survey of public health practitioners, we examine how perceptions about supervisors' and managers' commitment to DEI and their ability to support a diverse workforce relate to perceptions of organizational culture around DEI.</ab>
        <ab>Data from the 2021 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) to examine the relationship between public health employees' perceptions about their organization's commitment to DEI and factors related to those perceptions. PH WINS received 44 732 responses (35% response rate). We calculated descriptive statistics and constructed a logistic regression model to assess these relationships.</ab>
        <ab>Findings show that most public health employees perceive that their organizations are committed to DEI; however, perceptions about commitment to DEI vary by race, ethnicity, gender identity, and organizational setting. Across all settings, White respondents were more likely to agree with the statement, "My organization prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion" (range, 70%-75%), than Black/African American (range, 55%-65%) and Hispanic/Latino respondents (range, 62.5%-72.5%). Perception that supervisors worked well with individuals with diverse backgrounds had an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 5.37 ( P &lt; .001); organizational satisfaction had an AOR of 4.45 ( P &lt; .001). Compared with White staff, all other racial and ethnic groups had lower AOR of reporting their organizations prioritized DEI, with Black/African American staff being the lowest (AOR = 0.55), followed by Hispanic/Latino staff (AOR = 0.71) and all other staff (AOR = 0.82).</ab>
        <ab>These differences suggest that there are opportunities for organizational DEI commitment to marginalized public health staff to further support DEI and racial equity efforts. Building a diverse public health workforce pipeline will not be sufficient to achieve health equity if staff perceive that their organization does not prioritize DEI.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) may have chronic exposure to polypharmacy to address several medical needs, but there is little research on the topic to inform surveillance methods and clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To identify the trajectories of medication number and pediatric polypharmacy (≥2 concurrent medications) exposure over 3.5 years among children with CP. METHODS: This cohort study used commercial claims from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018 (4-year period). Children with CP, aged 5-18 years by January 1, 2016, and with continuous health plan enrollment for all 4 years, were included and categorized as with or without co-occurring neurological/ RESULTS: Of the 1,252 children with CP, 600 were in the CP only cohort (mean [SD]; age, 11.4 [4.1] years; 46.0% female) and 652 were in the CP + NDDs cohort (age, 11.9 [4.1] years; 41.3% female; 32.7% had ≥2 of the NDDs). For the primary GBTM, 3 trajectory groups were identified for CP only: on average, no prescribed medications (69.7% of the cohort), 1 medication/month (24.8%), and 4 medications/month (5.5%). Five trajectory groups were identified for CP + NDDs: 0 (22.4%), 1 (25.6%), 2 (25.2%), 4 (18.4%), and 6 (8.4%) prescribed medications/month. For the secondary GBTM, 3 trajectory groups were identified for CP only: 80.5% were characterized as negligible probability of polypharmacy exposure, 10.8% as low probability, and 8.7% as high probability. Five trajectory groups were identified for CP + NDDs: 37.9% as negligible probability of polypharmacy exposure, 32.8% as constantly high probability, and 29.2% as changing probability (eg, increasing/decreasing). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CP are chronically exposed to differing levels of polypharmacy. Findings can help establish polypharmacy surveillance practices. Studies need to determine if polypharmaceutical strategies are balanced to optimize health and development for children with CP.

        <ab>Big Cities Health Coalition member health departments (BCHC HDs) serve more than 61 million people across their jurisdictions, nearly 20% of the US population. As such, they have particular challenges and opportunities in how they do their work. This article focuses on BCHC HDs that participated in the 2021 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) and describes workplace perceptions, training needs, COVID-19 efforts, and well-being.</ab>
        <ab>To describe key characteristics of the governmental public health workforce among BCHC HDs, including demographics, perceptions, and needs.</ab>
        <ab>Using a subsample of data from the 2021 PH WINS that included 29 BCHC HDs, descriptive statistics on many of the topics covered by the 2021 PH WINS were analyzed and compared with the 2017 PH WINS.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-nine BCHC HDs in cities across the United States.</ab>
        <ab>In total, 7922 of 29 661 staff members (response rate of 27%) from participating BCHC HDs.</ab>
        <ab>Most BCHC HD respondents self-identified as a woman (76%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75%-77%), and as Black, Indigenous, and people of color (69%, 95% CI: 68%-70%), similar to findings from the 2017 PH WINS (75%, 95% CI: 74%-76%; 67%, 95% CI: 66%-69%, respectively). Most respondents believe that their organization prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (70%, 95% CI: 69%-72%). Thirty percent (95% CI: 29%-32%) intend to leave their organizations within 1 year, and 18% (95% CI: 17%-19%) plan to retire within 5 years. Staff connect their work with agency goals and priorities (86%, 95% CI: 85%-87%) and are determined to give their best effort every day (91%, 95% CI: 90%-91%).</ab>
        <ab>As the need for an all-encompassing focus on COVID-19 lessons, BCHC HDs should continue to focus on prioritizing staff retention, enhancing communication between senior staff and employees, and fostering an environment where innovation and creativity are rewarded.</ab>

        <ab>Several minority groups and students without home plastic surgery programs remain underrepresented in plastic surgery. To address these barriers, our division created the Plastic Surgery Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Mentorship Program and Workshop. Students meeting at least one of the following eligibility criteria were invited in fall of 2020: medical student in years 1 though 3 or a research year who is (1) underrepresented in medicine, including African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander; (2) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ); (3) first-generation low-income; or (4) does not have a plastic surgery residency program associated with their medical school. Students participated in quarterly meetings with their resident mentor and the annual hands-on workshop. The workshop was held on March 20, 2020, with both virtual and in-person participants. It included various didactic lectures, a suture laboratory, a resident panel, a social lunch hour, and extremity and head cadaver dissections with fracture plating. Twenty-four students attended the workshop. The course was rated 9.4 of 10 by students. The top met goals were gaining didactic plastic surgery knowledge (100%), exposure to a plastic surgery residency program (100%), resources to help overcome minority-specific barriers (96%), and technical skills such as suturing (96%). At the conclusion of the workshop, students had a significant increase in confidence in various aspects of plastic surgery knowledge and technical skills. The Plastic Surgery Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Mentorship Program and Workshop demonstrated preliminary success in providing support for students underrepresented in medicine and students without home programs.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the increased racial and ethnic diversity in the general population of the United States, the nursing workforce remains mostly White. Schools of nursing (SON) have increased recruitment and enrollment; however, students who represent racial and ethnic minoritized groups experience microaggressions, injustice, and social exclusion. This quality improvement program sought to equip faculty with skills to create a just and inclusive SON. The program was guided by the Institute for Healthcare's Model for Improvement.</ab>
        <ab>Five workshops were developed and implemented during two semesters. Workshops were led and moderated by a diversity, equity, and inclusion consultant.</ab>
        <ab>After the workshops, participants committed to create an inclusive environment, intervene when microaggressions occurred, implement curricular changes, and recognize themselves as members of a privileged group. Postworkshop discussions and reflections led to new initiatives in the SON.</ab>
        <ab>This faculty development program demonstrates programs to enhance justice, equity, and inclusion can be implemented successfully within SON. [ J Nurs Educ . 2023;62(1):20-27.] .</ab>

        <ab>Racial/ethnic discrimination is one form of mistreatment and a known risk factor for physician burnout. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the forms and identify the sources of racial/ethnic discrimination among vascular surgery trainees.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a cross-sectional study of U.S. vascular surgery trainees who had voluntarily participated in an anonymous survey administered after the 2021 Vascular Surgery In-Training Examination. The primary outcome measures were self-reported mistreatment and sources of mistreatment between race and ethnicity groups. We used χ 2 tests and logistic regression for bivariate and multivariable analyses, respectively.</ab>
        <ab>Representing all 123 vascular surgery training programs, 510 trainees (66.9% men) participated in the survey (83.6% response rate). Most of the trainees had self-identified as White (53.1%), followed by Asian (24.4%), Hispanic/Latinx (7.6%), Black (4.2%), and other/prefer not to say (10.8%). No significant differences were found in the self-reported duty hour violations among the groups. Black (56.3%) and Asian (36.3%) trainees reported higher rates of racial/ethnic discrimination compared with the White, Hispanic/Latinx, and other/prefer not to say groups (P &lt; .001). Patients and their families were reported as the most common source (74.7%). Other reported sources of discrimination included nurses or staff (60%), attendings (37.4%), co-residents (31.3%), and administration (16.9%). Regarding specific forms of racial discrimination, Black and Asian trainees reported the highest rates of different standards of evaluation (20% and 5.9%, respectively), being mistaken for a nonphysician (50.0% and 5.9%, respectively), slurs and/or hurtful comments (13.3% and 5.9%, respectively), social isolation (13.0% and 1.0%, respectively), and being mistaken for another trainee of the same race/ethnicity (60.0% and 33.7%, respectively). Only 62.5% of Black trainees reported their program/institution would take their mistreatment report seriously compared with the White (88.9%), Hispanic/Latinx (88.2%), Asian (83.2%), and other/prefer not to say (71.4%) trainees (P = .01). On multivariable analysis, female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-4.33), Asian race (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.53-13.3), Black race (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 4.25-43.4), and training in the Southeastern United States (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.17-12.80) were risk factors for racial/ethnic discrimination.</ab>
        <ab>The results from the survey revealed that racial/ethnic discrimination persists in surgical training programs, with Asian and Black trainees reporting higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. Overall, patients and family members were the most common source of racial/ethnic discrimination. However, faculty, staff, and co-trainees also contributed to racial/ethnic discrimination. Further interventions that optimize diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies and policies to address all forms of racial/ethnic discrimination with faculty, staff, and patients within the hospital are critically needed.</ab>

        <ab>There continues to be a disparity in the representation of women across medicine, including in editor positions at major medical journals. The authors repeated a study they had conducted in 2011 to compare the representation of women in editor-in-chief and editorial board member positions in 2011 and 2021.</ab>
        <ab>The authors included in their analysis the 60 journals from their original 2011 study and the top 5 ranked journals by Journal Impact Factor in each of 12 disciplines in 2021. This led to the inclusion of 86 journals. The authors collected the names and genders of the editors-in-chief and editorial board members at these journals, using information provided by the journals and a Google search for the photos and/or pronouns of the remaining editors. They compared results across years (2021 vs 2011), editor positions, disciplines, Journal Impact Factors, and ranks.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-two of the 90 editors-in-chief (24.4%) were women in 2021 compared with 10 of 63 (15.9%) in 2011, an increase of 8.5%. Of the 6,285 editorial board members, 1,756 were women (27.9%) in 2021 compared with 719 of 4,112 (17.5%) in 2011, an increase of 10.4%. Journals with women editors-in-chief gained 3.5 ranks and 9.1 points in Journal Impact Factor on average over this 10-year period, compared with no gain in rank and an increase of 4.7 points in Journal Impact Factor for journals with men editors-in-chief; both are statistically significant differences (P = .045 and P = .016, respectively).</ab>
        <ab>In almost all evaluated disciplines and editor positions, there was an increase in the percentage of women at top-ranked medical journals over a 10-year period. Despite this increase, improvements are still needed to accelerate the currently slow rate of change in these positions to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for women in medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion sciences were invigorated by Plaut's (2010) landmark publication "Diversity science: Why and how difference makes a difference." As this field has expanded over the last decade, it is timely to reflect on its current state and future directions. The goal of this special issue is to bring together a collection of articles that advance innovative theory and methods for the next generation of diversity, equity, and inclusion sciences. The articles in this special issue cover cutting-edge themes, such as critical research methods for liberation, healing, and reconciliation; advancing intersectional theory and methods; innovative theory and methods on individual-social dynamics; promoting equity and advancing research on culture, ethnicity, and race; and new approaches to measuring and overcoming racism.

        <ab>The influence of sex and gender in immune response and vaccine outcomes is established in many disease areas, including in COVID-19. Yet, there are notable gaps in the consideration of sex and gender in the analysis and reporting of COVID-19 vaccines clinical trial data. The push for stronger sex and gender integration in vaccines science should be championed by all researchers and stakeholders across the R&amp;D and access ecosystem - not just gender experts. This requires joint action on the tactical framing of customized value propositions (based on stakeholder motivations), the stronger enforcement of existing regulation, tools, and commitments, and aligning the overall agenda to parallel calls on intersectionality, equity diversity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Although perceived barriers to applying to dermatology have been researched among medical students, there remains a dearth of literature dedicated to understanding perceptions that medical students have of the field of dermatology and dermatologists.</ab>
        <ab>A review of the literature in Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were carried out to identify articles and abstracts between 2016 and 2021 relating to medical student perceptions of the field of dermatology. Peer-reviewed English studies measuring attitudes/level of interest in dermatology or other specialities, understanding of dermatologic topics, procedures, and/or scope of practice were included. Duplicate studies and conference abstracts were excluded. All publications were screened using the PRISMA-Sc guidelines. Findings were summarised and tabulated accordingly.</ab>
        <ab>A total of nine articles met inclusion criteria and eight are included in this review since one was not accessible online. Notable findings include non-US medical students perceiving dermatology as monotonous, stigmatized, unfamiliar, and difficult to access with a misunderstanding of the diversity and severity of the conditions dermatologists treat. No data on US medical student perceptions was found. Perceptions were found to be influential in career planning: medical students may reject specialities after exposure to negative comments on the field. Factors attracting students to dermatology include the appeal of being a dermatologist, media portrayal, and dermatologists' influence on patients' lives. Completion of dermatology-related activities improved medical student interest, comfort, and understanding of the field. Early dermatology exposure in US undergraduate premedical students led to heightened interest in the field, more confidence in ability to find dermatology mentors, and increased perception that dermatology serves the needs of underserved communities.</ab>
        <ab>This review demonstrates the need to further investigate medical student perceptions of dermatology, particularly in the United States. Perceptions of medical specialities can impact medical student career choices. Understanding which misconceptions may be preventing students from exploring dermatology can inform efforts towards improving diversity, equity, and inclusion: translating to an equitable match and improving patient outcomes. Limitations include exclusion of articles published before 2016, geographic variability in studies, and limited data on evolving student perceptions over time.</ab>
        <ab>The author declares that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</ab>

        <ab>Despite increased attention devoted to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within academic medicine, representation, lack of workforce and leadership diversity, and bias within medicine remain persistent problems. The purpose of the current study was to understand the current efforts and attention to DEI within academic departments of surgery in the United States. 251 department of surgery websites were reviewed, using a standardized data collection form and scoring procedure, accompanied by a 10 percent fidelity check by an independent reviewer. Only 16% of departments of surgery included DEI-specific information, such as a DEI mission statement or initiatives on their departmental sites, with less than seven percent of departments reporting a DEI committee. Such public information may have implications for recruitment and retention of diverse faculty and trainees, downstream effects for patient care, and could be critical to public accountability to improve diversity and create a culture of equity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>In the quest for greater equity in science, individual attitudes and institutional policies should also embrace greater diversity and inclusion of minority groups. This viewpoint calls for a broader definition of gender bias in STEM to include gender identity and for increased attention to the issue of bias amplification due to geographic affiliation in the field of computational chemistry and chemoinformatics. It briefly discusses some active interventions to tackle bias on gender, gender identity, and geographic affiliation in STEM.</ab>

        <ab>The National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP)-the competency framework for paramedics in Canada-is presently undergoing revision. Since the NOCP was published in 2011, paramedic practice, healthcare, and society have changed dramatically. To inform the revision, we sought to identify emerging concepts in the literature that would inform the development of competencies for paramedics. We conducted a restricted literature review and content analysis of all published and grey literature pertaining to or informing Canadian paramedicine from 2011 to 2022. Three authors performed a title, abstract, and full-text review to identify and label concepts informed by existing findings. A total of 302 articles were categorized into 11 emerging concepts related to competencies: inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) in paramedicine; social responsiveness, justice, equity, and access; anti-racism; healthy professionals; evidence-informed practice and systems; complex adaptive systems; learning environment; virtual care; clinical reasoning; adaptive expertise; and planetary health. This review identified emerging concepts to inform the development of the 2023 National Occupational Standard for Paramedics (NOSP). These concepts will inform data analysis, the development of group discussions, and competency identification.</ab>

        <ab>There have been a number of federal policies and guidance's impacting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEI) in clinical research. While these are needed, they have not diminished the gaps related to clinical trial recruitment, research professional's capacity for cultural competence, and clinical research professional role development. Mentoring and co-mentoring circles have traditionally been used in Medicine, but until now had not been used for workforce development of clinical research professionals (CRPs).</ab>
        <ab>We designed a six-session, monthly co-mentoring circle to take place at two academic medical centers to pilot an interinstitutional co-mentoring circle centered on storytelling videos of Black Voices in Clinical Research. This provided a DEI framework for discussions on role experiences, cultural competence, and role progression.</ab>
        <ab>Seven CRPs completed the DRC pilot. The participants positively evaluated the experience and made recommendations for future iterations. Discussion: Co-mentoring circles can be useful tools to connect CRPs across complex research medical centers and provide support that may have a positive impact on role satisfaction and retention.</ab>
        <ab>This framework for developing co-mentoring circles can serve as a toolkit for future CRP co-mentoring circles within and across institutions for workforce development. The Black Voices in Clinical Research storytelling videos provide a rich foundation for future discussion on DEI issues for CRPs and collaborating with participants.</ab>

        <ab>To describe the design and methodological approach of a multicenter, retrospective study to externally validate a clinical and imaging-based model for predicting the risk of late adverse events in patients with initially uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD).</ab>
        <ab>The Registry of Aortic Diseases to Model Adverse Events and Progression (ROADMAP) is a collaboration between 10 academic aortic centers in North America and Europe. Two centers have previously developed and internally validated a recently developed risk prediction model. Clinical and imaging data from eight ROADMAP centers will be used for external validation. Patients with uTBAD who survived the initial hospitalization between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013, with follow-up until 2020, will be retrospectively identified. Clinical and imaging data from the index hospitalization and all follow-up encounters will be collected at each center and transferred to the coordinating center for analysis. Baseline and follow-up CT scans will be evaluated by cardiovascular imaging experts using a standardized technique.</ab>
        <ab>The primary end point is the occurrence of late adverse events, defined as aneurysm formation (≥6 cm), rapid expansion of the aorta (≥1 cm/y), fatal or nonfatal aortic rupture, new refractory pain, uncontrollable hypertension, and organ or limb malperfusion. The previously derived multivariable model will be externally validated by using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling.</ab>
        <ab>This study will show whether a recent clinical and imaging-based risk prediction model for patients with uTBAD can be generalized to a larger population, which is an important step toward individualized risk stratification and therapy.

        <ab>Many countries adopted comprehensive national initiatives to promote equity in higher education with the goal of transforming the culture of research. Major health research funders are supporting this work through calls for projects that focus on equity, resulting in a proliferation of theoretical frameworks including "intersectionality," "health equity," and variations of equity, diversity and inclusion, or EDI. This commentary is geared at individual principal investigators and health research teams who are developing research proposals and want to consider equity issues in their research, perhaps for the first time. We present histories and definitions of three commonly used frameworks: intersectionality, health equity, and EDI. In the context of health research, intersectionality is a methodology (a combination of epistemology and techniques) that can identify the relationships among individual identities and systems of oppression; however, it should also be used internally by research teams to reflect on the production of knowledge. Health equity is a societal goal that operationalizes the social determinants of health to document and address health disparities at the population level. EDI initiatives measure and track progress within organizations or teams and are best suited to inform the infrastructure and human resourcing "behind the scenes" of a project. We encourage researchers to consider these definitions and strive to tangibly move health research towards equity both in the topics we study and in the ways we do research.</ab>

        <ab>Delivery of electrophysiology (EP) care in developing nations and underserviced populations faces many hurdles, including the lack of local expertise and knowledge creation. The West Indies has experienced a paucity of local EP expertise. The University of Toronto has undertaken a unique collaborative educational effort with the University of the West Indies.</ab>
        <ab>We describe the effects of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in EP training at Toronto General Hospital in Canada by quantifying the impact of training the first female electrophysiologists to practice in Jamaica and Saint Lucia.</ab>
        <ab>Data from the ministries of health in Jamaica and Saint Lucia were reviewed. The number of arrhythmia clinic patients seen, EP studies and ablations performed, pacemaker clinic patients seen, and implantable devices, permanent pacemakers (PPMs), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) implanted were assessed.</ab>
        <ab>One hundred one arrhythmia consults were seen by the new electrophysiologist in Jamaica after her return from training in 2020. She has since performed 19 EP studies/catheter ablations at a newly established ablation laboratory. Three cases of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to tachy-cardiomyopathy were treated successfully with catheter ablation with immense improvement in LV ejection fraction. Thirteen PPMs, 1 ICD, and 3 LV leads were implanted, after which no early complications were identified. In Saint Lucia, where there is no dedicated electrophysiology laboratory, 2 patients who required catheter ablation for tachycardia-mediated LV dysfunction were identified by the electrophysiologist since her return to the island in 2018. The patients were appropriately referred, resulting in restoration of normal LV function. Six PPMs also were implanted in Saint Lucia. Knowledge translation has been limited by the lack of accessibility to the required devices, catheters, and specialized equipment and accessories, mainly because of their costs.</ab>
        <ab>Training the first female electrophysiologists from Jamaica and Saint Lucia led to a quantifiable impact on EP care in both of these Caribbean countries. EDI strategies in EP training programs provide much needed benefits to developing nations, but more support is needed to allow new electrophysiologists to fully utilize their EP training to care for underserviced populations.</ab>

        <ab>To survey radiation oncology residents on perceptions of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in their residency training programs.</ab>
        <ab>A 23-item survey was developed by the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee (ARRO EISC) resident members and faculty advisors and sent to all residents from ACGME accredited programs. The survey was divided into 4 sections: Institutional Culture, Support and Resources, Interview and Recruitment, and Experiences of Bias. The survey was sent individually to residents from all ACGME accredited radiation oncology programs.</ab>
        <ab>The survey was issued to 757 residents. 319 residents completed the survey, for a response rate of 42%. All post-graduate years (PGY) and geographic regions were represented. Significant racial, ethnic, and gender differences were present in survey response patterns. White residents (94%, 164/174) and male residents (96%, 186/194) were more likely to strongly agree/agree that they were treated with respect by their colleagues and their co-workers than other racial groups (p &lt;0.005) or gender groups (p&lt;0.008). Only 3% (5/174) of white residents strongly agreed/agreed that they were treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity, while 31% (5/16) of Black residents and 10% (9/94) of Asian residents strongly agreed/agreed (p&lt;.0001). Similarly, Hispanic residents were more likely to strongly/agree (24%, 5/21) than non-Hispanic residents (7%, 20/298; p=0.003). Regarding mentorship, there were no differences by gender or ethnicity. There were differences by race in residents reporting that they had a supportive mentor (p=0.022), with residents 89% (154/174) of white residents who strongly agreed/agreed, 88% (14/16) of Black residents, and 91% of Asian residents (86/94).</ab>
        <ab>This survey reveals that experiences of support, mentorship, inclusion, and bias vary significantly among radiation oncology residents based on race, ethnicity and gender. Radiation oncology has opportunity for growth to ensure an equitable experience for all residents.</ab>

        <ab>The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program recognizes that advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) requires moving beyond statements of commitment to transformative actions. In 2021, the CTSA Program created a Task Force (TF) to initiate work in support of structural and transformational initiatives that advance DEIA for the consortium and its individual hubs. We describe the process of forming the expertise-driven (DEIA) TF and our activities to date. We 1) developed and adopted the DEIA Learning Systems Framework to guide our approach; 2) defined a set of recommendations across four focus areas (Institutional; Programmatic; Community-Centered; and Social, Cultural, Environmental); and 3) designed and disseminated a survey to capture the CTSA Program's baseline demographic, community, infrastructural, and leadership diversity. The CTSA Consortium also elevated the TF to a standing Committee to extend our understanding, development, and implementation of DEIA approaches to translational and clinical science. These initial steps provide a foundation for collectively fostering environment that support DEIA across the research continuum.</ab>

        <ab>In the US, a growing number of organizations and industries are seeking to affirm their commitment to and efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as recent events have increased attention to social inequities. As health care organizations are considering new ways to incorporate DEI initiatives within their workforce, the anticipated result of these efforts is a reduction in health inequities that have plagued our country for centuries. Unfortunately, there are few frameworks to guide these efforts because few successfully link organizational DEI initiatives with health equity outcomes. The purpose of this chapter is to review existing scholarship and evidence using an organizational lens to examine how health care organizations can advance DEI initiatives in the pursuit of reducing or eliminating health inequities. First, this chapter defines important terms of DEI and health equity in health care. Next, we describe the methods for our narrative review. We propose a model for understanding health care organizational activity and its impact on health inequities based in organizational learning that includes four interrelated parts: intention, action, outcomes, and learning. We summarize the existing scholarship in each of these areas and provide recommendations for enhancing future research. Across the body of knowledge in these areas, disciplinary and other silos may be the biggest barrier to knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Moving forward, scholars and practitioners should seek to collaborate further in their respective efforts to achieve health equity by creating formalized initiatives with linkages between practice and research communities.</ab>

        <ab>Significant racial/ethnic disparities in dermatologic care and their subsequent impact on dermatologic conditions were recently reported. Contributing factors include socioeconomic factors, gaps in educational exposure, and underrepresentation of minority groups in the dermatologic workforce. In 2021, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) announced its three-year plan to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion in dermatology. One way to reduce disparities in dermatology is for every dermatologist, regardless of race or ethnicity, to receive adequate education in diseases, treatments, health equity, and tailored approaches to delivering dermatologic care with cultural humility. In addition, a diverse dermatologic workforce-especially at the level of residency program educators and organizational leaders-will contribute to improved cross-cultural understanding, more inclusive research efforts, and improved treatment approaches for conditions that are more prevalent or nuanced in certain racial/ethnic populations. Finally, the dermatology and broader healthcare community needs to acknowledge and educate ourselves on the health impacts of racism.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts at academic medical centers (AMCs) began prior to 2020, but have been accelerated after the death of George Floyd, leading many AMCs to recommit their support for DEI. Institutions crafted statements to decry racism, but we assert that institutions must make a transparent, continuous, and robust financial investment to truly show their commitment to DEI. This financial investment should focus on (1) advocacy efforts for programs that will contribute to DEI in health, (2) pipeline programs to support and guide minoritized students to enter health professions, and (3) the recruitment and retention of minoritized faculty. While financial investments will not eliminate all DEI concerns within AMCs, investing significant financial resources consistently and intentionally will better position AMCs to truly advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within healthcare, the community, and beyond.</ab>

        <ab>Given the long-standing history of systemic racism in psychological science, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts are increasingly vital to the advancement and improvement of the field. This commentary extends the seminal work of the article Upending Racism in Psychological Science: Strategies to Change How Our Science is Conducted, Reported, Reviewed, and Disseminated (Buchanan et al., Am Psychol, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6nk4x , 2020) by providing tangible applications and recommendations to improve DEI integration into pediatric adherence science. Real-world adherence examples are discussed regarding the challenges faced in systematically integrating DEI principles, potential solutions to overcoming barriers, and the implications of these efforts on scientific advancement in an effort to address and dismantle research practices that perpetuate inequity and White supremacy. Specifically, we provide discourse and practical guidance related to the conduct, reporting, reviewing, and dissemination of pediatric adherence science to promote dialog and produce actionable change toward the promotion of health equity and social justice.</ab>

        <ab>An extensive body of research about team science provides empirical evidence that diverse teams outperform homogenous teams in creating more innovative solutions to complex problems. At the core of diverse and inclusive teams is a rich diversity of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds that invite new questions and broaden the scope of research. Diverse perspectives are especially relevant for biomedicine, which seeks to find solutions for challenging problems affecting the human condition. It is essential that diversity and inclusion in biomedicine is prioritized as a key driver of innovation, both through the people who conduct the research and the science itself. Key questions have been articulated as important drivers for funding research: (1) Who is doing the science and who is building the tools? (2) What science and technology is being done and how? and (3) Who has access to the knowledge and benefits of scientific innovation? I will briefly review the empirical evidence supporting diversity as a powerful enhancer of the quality and outputs of research and clinical care. I offer my own research as a case study of incorporating a framework of diversity, equity, and inclusion into research that uses new emerging genomic tools for earlier and more precise diagnosis of organ transplant rejection. I will demonstrate how these same tools hold great promise for accelerating the discovery of hitherto unexplored mechanisms that drive the poor outcomes for African ancestry organ transplant recipients, which in turn will identify new diagnostics and therapeutic targets that benefit transplant recipients across all ancestries.</ab>

        <ab>Participants in the leadership breakout session at the Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA) virtual 2020 conference discussed and ranked six recommendations in terms of feasibility, impact, and priority for advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts to elevate underrepresented populations to leadership positions in CTSAs and their broader institutions. A thematic analysis of chat and polling data identified challenges and opportunities to achieve DEI goals, with the three most promising recommendations as: cross-institutional Principal Investigator (P.I.) action-learning workgroups, transparent policies for recruiting and promoting underrepresented minorities (URM) leadership, and a clear succession plan to nurture and elevate URM leaders. Suggestions are made to improve DEI in CTSA leadership and allow for greater representation in the translational science field.</ab>

        <ab>The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committee was established in 2017 within the Department of Pediatrics at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), an academic medical health center located on the near west side of Chicago, IL. Results from climate surveys highlighted the need for increased DEI initiatives within the department, and a renewed national reckoning on racial tensions sparked an additional sense of urgency for system-level change. This paper outlines the initial creation and ongoing efforts of the DEI committee. Information related to the structure of our committee, aims of our work, progress toward identified goals, as well as ongoing barriers is provided. Academic medical health centers are tasked not only with working and training together, but also to care for a diverse group of patients within a larger community. As such, academic medical health centers represent a unique backdrop and opportunity for individual and system-level change.</ab>

        <ab>To examine factors that influence intrapartum health outcomes among Black childbearing persons, including cisgender women, transmasculine and gender-diverse birthing persons.</ab>
        <ab>Black childbearing persons are three to four times (243%) more likely to die while giving birth than any other racial/ethnic group. Black birthing persons are not just dying from complications but also from inequitable care from healthcare providers compared to their white counterparts.</ab>
        <ab>Discursive paper.</ab>
        <ab>Searching national literature published between 2010 and 2021 in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and SCOPUS, we explored factors associated with poor intrapartum health outcomes among Black childbearing persons.</ab>
        <ab>Several studies have ruled out social determinants of health as sufficient causative factors for poor intrapartum health outcomes among Black birthing persons. Recent research has shown that discrimination by race heavily influences whether a birthing person dies while childbearing.</ab>
        <ab>There is a historical context for obstetric medicine that includes harmful stereotypes, implicit bias and racism, all having a negative impact on intrapartum health outcomes. The existing health disparity among this population is endemic and requires close attention.</ab>
        <ab>Nurses and other healthcare professionals must understand their role in establishing unbiased care that promotes respect for diversity, equity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 1219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]).</ab>
        <ab>Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.</ab>

        <ab>Enduring questions about equity are front and center at this watershed moment in health care and public health. Inequities that became evident in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have highlighted long-standing disparities in health by race and ethnicity. Current crises require examining and reorienting the systems that have, for decades, produced these health inequities; yet, public health and health care leaders are inadequately prepared to respond. The authors offer an equity-centered leadership framework to support the development of visionary leaders for tomorrow. This framework for leadership development programs interweaves traditional leadership and equity, diversity, and inclusion domains in both conceptual knowledge and skills-based teaching for health care and public health leaders, grouping competencies and skills into 4 domains: personal, interpersonal, organizational, and community and systems. A framework such as this will equip leaders with the mindset and skill set to challenge the paradigms that lead to inequity and health disparities.</ab>

        <ab>In 2015, the Council on Research published their vision for scientific decision making, which provided nutrition and dietetics practitioners and practitioners-in-training key information on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' newly developed scientific integrity principles. Given that it has been 7 years since the original publication, it was believed the original six principles should be revisited and updated. From the Subcommittee on Scientific Integrity Principles under the Council on Research, the 2015 principles were evaluated and updated with new literature and best practices for maintaining scientific integrity principles. After this review process, four new/updated principles were approved by the Council on Research. These include: 1) the ethical conduct of research and protection of human subjects, 2) funder's influence on the research question/methodology/education content and conflicts of interest, 3) review of research-related materials, and 4) maintain and promote a culture of scientific integrity. Moreover, it became clear that newer topics, including diversity, equity, and inclusion should be woven throughout the principles. This article presents the newly updated principles and resources related to scientific integrity principles. We envision that this document can be used by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to educate members and serve as a guide to incorporate these principles into all research practices and at all levels of dietetics practice.</ab>

        <ab>Increased diversity in academic institutions may potentially result in more diversity seen in practicing clinicians. Colleges and universities have recently implemented strategies to diversify their faculty. However, current efforts and scholarly publications are often limited to recruitment and retention strategies. This article aims to provide a comprehensive DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) critique on professional development through the personal journey of two Latinx physical therapists in higher education on a non-tenured, clinician-educator track. A personal narrative of the two authors examines some barriers and challenges faced, as well as accounting for catalysts that facilitated their professional development at a tier one academic institution. These perspectives follow the model principles adopted by the University of Pittsburgh. Program for underrepresented minority (URM) faculty members, which considers URM educational background, recruitment, retention, research opportunities, community building, counseling, mentoring, scientific writing, and scientific presentation skills training. To create conditions where URM individuals can thrive, organizations should resist using a "quick fix" by only attempting to hire diverse individuals and fill a quota. Professional development efforts should assess failures and accomplishments, fostering an environment of trust to address the specific needs of URM faculty members to ensure their success in their academic journey.</ab>

        <ab>Many fellowship programs in North America prepare surgeons for a career in Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) surgery. Recent fellowship graduates were surveyed as part of a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis commissioned by Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA).</ab>
        <ab>This was a cross-sectional study surveying AHPBA-certified fellowship graduates conducted August-December 2021. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Free-text answers were analyzed using both grounded theory principles and thematic network analyses.</ab>
        <ab>Four main themes were identified: (i) concerns regarding the lack of standardization between HPB fellowship curricula (ii) concern for job market oversaturation, (iii) need to emphasize the value in HPB fellowship training and (iv) importance of diversity, inclusion, and equity in HPB training.</ab>
        <ab>Based on themes identified, the strengths of AHPBA-certified HPB programs include superior case volume and technical training. Areas of weakness and growth opportunities include standardizing training experiences. According to AHPBA-certificate awardees, optimizing future HPB fellowships would include strong sponsorship for job placement after graduation, and more intentional investments in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>To examine websites of didactic programs in dietetics (DPD) for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-related language and to assess perceived gender and ethnic/racial representation in images.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a content analysis on the first 6 website images and 3-elements of DPD (n = 212) websites (mission statement, goals and objectives, and the immediate landing page). Descriptive statistics and a website DEI score were calculated.</ab>
        <ab>Equity and inclusion-related terms appeared on &lt; 5% of websites. Diversity and culture-related terms appeared on about one-third of websites. On average, researchers perceived 28.45% of people in website images as non-White, and 20.11% as non-female. Most websites received low DEI scores.</ab>
        <ab>The DPD websites had a limited representation of DEI-related terms and image representation of individuals perceived to be non-female and non-White. Leaders of DPDs may consider displaying and describing the program's commitment to DEI on the website for potential students.</ab>

        <ab>In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 1,219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]).</ab>
        <ab>Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.</ab>

        <ab>Schools of nursing must produce nurses able to address the care needs of diverse populations. Within schools of nursing, faculty should intentionally construct syllabi to establish an environment of inclusivity where diversity is embraced.</ab>
        <ab>Content analysis of 81 undergraduate and graduate course syllabi from four university campuses was performed to determine explicit evidence of content on diverse populations, inclusive andragogy, and policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</ab>
        <ab>Three quarters of terms indicative of diverse populations were found in course syllabi; all terms that provided evidence of inclusive andragogy and all DEI-related policies were identified at least once in course syllabi.</ab>
        <ab>Strengths and weaknesses were identified in communicating DEI content, policies, and inclusive andragogy to students. Faculty development on best practices related to inclusion of DEI in the classroom beginning with the syllabus is the first step to ensure a more inclusive nursing workforce.

        <ab>I am deeply honored to be the recipient of the 2022 ASCB Public Service Award. In addition to my research on the cytoskeleton and molecular motors, I devoted a significant part of my professional career to issues pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Diversity of the scientific workforce is essential to accomplish the mission of discovery and innovation required to advance scientific knowledge and improve human health, especially the health of Black communities. This pressing need requires new approaches to address the problem of inclusivity in science. The Black Lives Matter movement and the murder of George Floyd were events that triggered people around the world to begin to reckon with structural racism and new approaches to dismantle it. It is through this momentary lens that I founded the PAIR-UP Imaging Science Program for Black Imaging Scientists. The purpose of PAIR-UP is to improve the professional work environment for Black imaging scientists at R1 institutions by building a self-reinforcing community of Black scientists across institutions committed to helping each other sustain a strong cultural identity. Reenforcing and sustaining a strong cultural identity has the potential to be transformational for the scientists participating in PAIR-UP.</ab>

        <ab>Medicine remains an inequitable profession for women. Challenges are compounded for underrepresented women in medicine (UWiM), yet the complex features of underrepresentation and how they influence women's career paths remain underexplored. This qualitative study examined the experiences of trainees self-identifying as UWiM, including how navigating underrepresentation influenced their envisioned career paths.</ab>
        <ab>Ten UWiM family medicine trainees from one Canadian institution participated in semi-structured group interviews. Thematic analysis of the data was informed by feminist epistemology and unfolded during an iterative process of data familiarization, coding, and theme generation.</ab>
        <ab>Participants identified as UWiM based on visible and invisible identity markers. All participants experienced discrimination and "otherness", but experiences differed based on how identities intersected. Participants spent considerable energy anticipating discrimination, navigating otherness, and assuming protective behaviours against real and perceived threats. Both altruism and a desire for personal safety and inclusion influenced their envisioned careers serving marginalized populations and mentoring underrepresented trainees.</ab>
        <ab>Equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in medical education risk being of little value without a comprehensive and intersectional understanding of the visible and invisible identities of underrepresented trainees. UWiM trainees' accounts suggest that they experience significant identity dissonance that may result in unintended consequences if left unaddressed. Our study generated the critical awareness required for medical educators and institutions to examine their biases and meet their obligation of creating a safer and more equitable environment for UWiM trainees.</ab>

        <ab>Skin of color (SOC) patients are projected to comprise the majority of the population by 2044, yet knowledge gaps in the clinical presentation and treatment of both common and uncommon dermatologic conditions in skin of color persist. Improved awareness of disparities that disproportionately impact SOC patients is necessary to address health inequity in the field of dermatology. The first part of this CME discussed structural, genetic, and immunophenotypic differences in SOC in common inflammatory disorders as well as cutaneous malignancies. The second part of this CME highlights clinical differences in the phenotypic presentation of the inflammatory disorders of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa as well as the cutaneous malignancies of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Health disparities associated with each of these conditions are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Contemporary information on health equity related efforts by scientific neurological journals, as measured by publications related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and health disparities related to social determinants of health (SDH) are lacking.</ab>
        <ab>To assess the yearly rates of DEI and SDH related publications in the highest cited general neurology and neurological sub-specialty journals and compare them to the highest cited medical journals over a 6-year period.</ab>
        <ab>We included publications from 15 general neurology and neurological subspecialty journals between January 1 st 2015 to December 31 st 2020. For comparison we included the 15 most cited medical journals as measured by H-Index. We performed a PubMed search in each of the listed journals using key MeSH terms. Two-proportions Z-test and chi-square trend analyses were used to compare differences between journal types.</ab>
        <ab>Total yearly proportion of DEI and SDH related publications in neurological journals was 3.9% compared to 6.2% in the highest cited medical journals for years 2015 to 2020 (p=0.001). There was no change in overall trend in publications related to DEI and SDH topics in neurological (ρ = -0.082, p=0.45) or highest cited medical journals between 2015 and 2020 (ρ = -0.065, p=0.54).</ab>
        <ab>Neurological journals had a significantly lower yearly proportion of DEI and SDH related publications compared to top-cited medical journals. Despite heightened awareness of racial/ethnic health disparities and inequities driven by SDH there was no change in related publications in neurological journals between 2015-2020.</ab>

        <ab>To explore the perspectives of lactation support providers delivering breastfeeding education via in-person and telehealth consultations and assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of breastfeeding education.</ab>
        <ab>Qualitative descriptive study using purposive sampling.</ab>
        <ab>Massachusetts-based lactation support providers who provided in-person and/or telehealth consultations in various practice settings (e.g., inpatient; outpatient; private practice; and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children).</ab>
        <ab>Fourteen Massachusetts-based lactation support providers, ages 36 to 68 years.</ab>
        <ab>Participants completed an online demographic and employment characteristics survey and virtual key informant interviews, from which six main themes were defined.</ab>
        <ab>The six main themes included Common Questions Asked by Clients, Prenatal and Postpartum Consultation Topics, Facilitators for Telehealth Versus In-Person Consultations, Barriers for Telehealth Versus In-Person Consultations, Best Practices, and COVID-19 Adaptations. From participant interviews, common subthemes emerged. The primary adaptation due to COVID-19 was shifting to telehealth. Content in lactation consultations was similar via in-person and telehealth sessions. Typical content areas included breast pumping and mother's milk supply. A notable difference was the lack of physical examinations for women and newborns in telehealth sessions. Scheduling flexibility was a key facilitator of telehealth consultations, whereas the inability to provide hands-on assistance and chaotic home environments were common barriers. In-person facilitators included weighing newborns to assess feeding success and insurance billing coverage, whereas unsupportive family members were noted as a barrier. Diversity, equity, and inclusion-related barriers (e.g., language barriers, lack of reflective diversity, lack of stable Internet access) were observed in both settings. Best practices for in-person and telehealth consultations included meeting mothers where they are and focusing on mothers' goals.</ab>
        <ab>Practice adaptations adopted during the pandemic and best practice recommendations may be useful for lactation support providers and other health care professionals caring for breastfeeding dyads.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare education practices need to integrate values of justice, equity, diversity, inclusion (JEDI), and belonging to address the racism that continues to infiltrate society. The myths and incorrect assumptions about race in healthcare perpetuate patient care practices that are racially discriminatory and grow the inequitable healthcare crisis in the U.S. The response to abolish racism in healthcare begins with professional health education, and white allies are called to action by creating anti-racist classrooms. White allies in education can lead their classrooms to respond to racism by developing a JEDI Code that creates a learning environment of belonging. There are five aspects of leadership to create change that are investigated and applied to the development of anti-racist classrooms. The educator, as an anti-racist leader, serves as a change agent, role model, and ethical healthcare practitioner. A "classroom of practice" encourages a culture of belonging among students and creates a structure for all students to grow and develop in the anti-racist space. This commentary aims to acknowledge the culture of racism in healthcare and how it is propagated by current education practices in professional health education programs while investigating teaching and learning strategies that support the evolution of an anti-racist classroom.</ab>

        <ab>Given its subject matter, biological psychiatry is uniquely poised to lead STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives related to disability. Drawing on literatures in science, philosophy, psychiatry, and disability studies, we outline how that leadership might be undertaken. We first review existing opportunities for the advancement of DEI in biological psychiatry around axes of gender and race. We then explore the expansion of biological psychiatry's DEI efforts to disability, especially along the lines of representation and access, community accountability, first-person testimony, and revised theoretical frameworks for pathology. We close with concrete recommendations for scholarship and practice going forward. By tackling head-on the challenge of disability inclusion, biological psychiatry has the opportunity to be a force of transformation in the biological sciences and beyond.</ab>

        <ab>In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 1219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]).</ab>
        <ab>Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.</ab>

        <ab>Events of spring 2020-the COVID19 pandemic and re-birth of a social justice movement-have thrown disparities in disease risk, morbidity, and mortality in sharp relief. In response, healthcare organizations have shifted attentions and resources towards equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) issues and initiatives like never before. Focused, proven equity-centered skill and mindset development is needed for healthcare professionals to operationalize these pledges and stated aims.</ab>
        <ab>This article highlights program evaluation results for this Clinical Scholars National Leadership Institute (CSNLI) specific to EDI. We will show that CSNLI imparts the valuable and essential skills to health professionals that are needed to realize health equity through organizational and system change.</ab>
        <ab>Initial cohort of 29 participants in CSNLI, engaging in the program over 3 years through in-person and distance-based learning offerings and activities.</ab>
        <ab>The CSNLI is a 3-year, intensive leadership program that centers EDI skill development across personal, interpersonal, organizational, and systems domains through its design, competencies, and curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>A robust evaluation following the Kirkpatrick Model offers analysis of four data collecting activities related to program participants' EDI learning, behavioral change, and results.</ab>
        <ab>Over the course of the program, participants made significant gains in competencies related to equity, diversity, and inclusion. Furthermore, participants demonstrated growth in behavior change and leadership activities in the areas of organizational and system change. Results demonstrate the need to center both leader and leadership development on equity, diversity, and inclusion curriculum to make real change in the US Healthcare System.</ab>

        <ab>Medical education programs profess commitments to justice, equity, and inclusion, seeking to diversify the profession and better serve patient populations. Although disability has more recently joined recognized categories of valued diversity, significant barriers remain for disabled learners in medicine. This paper develops the concept of the capability imperative, derived from a constructivist grounded theory study examining disability inclusion at four U.S. medical schools that analyzed technical standards policies and interviews with 19 disabled students and 27 school officials (faculty and administrators). Through three motifs (the selfless superhuman; the "real world" of medicine; and the malleable student), the capability imperative enforces the characteristics of a good physician, justifies institutional arrangements, and seeks to produce a learner who can conform to these expectations. Drawing on critical disability theories of ableism and crip theory, the paper argues that the capability imperative represents a context-specific manifestation of ableism that upholds a cultural logic of compulsory hyper-ablebodiedness and mindedness. This logic is antithetical to inclusive goals. Exploration of what constitutes a physician and whom this vision serves may help to shift the professional culture towards justice and unroot disabled peoples' ongoing marginalization in the medical profession.</ab>

        <ab>Skin of color (SOC) populations include those who identify as Black/African, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Native Alaskan, Indigenous Australian, Middle Eastern, biracial/multiracial, or non-White; this list is far from exhaustive and may vary between and within cultures. Recent genetic and immunological studies have suggested that cutaneous inflammatory disorders (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa) and malignancies (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) may have variations in their immunophenotype among SOC. Additionally, there is growing recognition of the substantial role social determinants of health play in driving health inequalities in SOC communities. It is critically important to understand that social determinants of health often play a larger role than biologic or genetic factors attributed to "race" in health care outcomes. Herein, we describe the structural, genetic, and immunological variations and the potential implications of these variations in populations with SOC. This article underscores the importance of increasing the number of large, robust genetic studies of cutaneous disorders in SOC to create more targeted, effective therapies for this often underserved and understudied population. Part II of this CME will highlight the clinical differences in the phenotypic presentation of and the health disparities associated with the aforementioned cutaneous disorders in SOC.</ab>

        <ab>Including sex and gender considerations in health research is considered essential by many funders and is very useful for policy makers, program developers, clinicians, consumers and other end users. While longstanding confusions and conflations of terminology in the sex and gender field are well documented, newer conceptual confusions and conflations continue to emerge. Contemporary social demands for improved health and equity, as well as increased interest in precision healthcare and medicine, have made obvious the need for sex and gender science, sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA+), considerations of intersectionality, and equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives (EDI) to broaden representation among participants and diversify research agendas. But without a shared and precise understanding of these conceptual areas, fields of study, and approaches and their inter-relationships, more conflation and confusion can occur. This article sets out these areas and argues for more precise operationalization of sex- and gender-related factors in health research and policy initiatives in order to advance these varied agendas in mutually supportive ways.</ab>

        <ab>To describe an approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy development at a school of pharmacy aimed at stakeholder investment and infrastructure that can address systemic challenges in various healthcare settings.</ab>
        <ab>The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy utilized an organizational approach focused on infrastructure to produce a diverse and inclusive school community. The Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) established vision and mission statements to represent the school's commitment and conducted a comprehensive environmental scan to compose a shared vision. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni participated in a series of retreats, symposiums, and focus groups to identify opportunities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive school community. A working group comprised of key leaders in the school developed and launched a 3-year DEI Strategic Plan along with initiatives and metrics for year 1. The plan's 3 priorities were (1) to recruit and retain diverse talent, (2) to prepare culturally intelligent professionals, and (3) to build an inclusive community. The ODI collaborated with internal and external stakeholders, which included students, faculty, staff, postdocs, alumni, and partners from health systems, industry, and other institutions and organizations, to initiate, implement, and monitor progress through an organizational approach to establish accountability and greater commitment.</ab>
        <ab>An organizational approach to DEI strategy through stakeholder engagement and infrastructure increased commitment and shared ownership among members of the school community. Applications in an organizational approach can be adapted to multiple healthcare settings to contribute to the cultural transformation necessary to develop a diverse and inclusive healthcare workforce.</ab>

        <ab>Neuro-oncology has grown tremendously since 2010, marked by increasing society membership, specialized clinical expertise, and new journals. Yet, modest improvement in racial/ethnic diversity amongst clinical trial participants, researchers, and clinicians led us to conduct a survey to identify opportunities to enhance diversity and inclusiveness amongst neuro-oncology professionals.</ab>
        <ab>In summer 2020, the Women and Diversity Committee of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) distributed an anonymous online survey to members and affiliates including the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO), Asian Society for Neuro-Oncology (ASNO), Society for Neuro-Oncology Latin America (SNOLA) and Society for Neuro-Oncology Sub-Saharan Africa (SNOSSA). The survey captured personal and professional characteristics, biases, effective mentorship qualities, career service metrics, and suggested field/society changes. Results were analyzed by geography, profession, age, racial/ethnic, and sexual identity. Standard descriptive statistics characterized the study population.</ab>
        <ab>The 386 respondents were predominantly female (58%) with a median age range of 40-49 years (31%), White (65%), and SNO members (97%). Most worked in North America (77%) in a research profession (67%). A majority of White respondents reported never experiencing biases (64%), while the majority of non-White respondents reported unconscious biases/microaggressions, followed by a lack of/limited mentorship. Qualitative assessments showcased that personal/professional success metrics were linked to needed improvements in diversity and inclusion efforts within the neuro-oncology field.</ab>
        <ab>The prevalence of racial/ethnic biases and poor mentorship rates amongst underrepresented groups in neuro-oncology is high and potentially linked to the limited diverse representation amongst members and affiliates. These findings warrant a swift implementation of equity and inclusion practices within the neuro-oncology field.</ab>

        <ab>The lack of diversity in surgical career pathways impacts the cultural competence of the learning and working environment, the variety of leadership styles found within surgical leadership, and the ability of an organization to achieve equity in the workplace due to ongoing mistrust and untouched bias. Leading mitigating factors include developing pathways for greater numbers of diverse people at the high school and college level and implicit bias training. Though educators have had some success with these factors in the initial stages of diversifying early pathways, these factors are not yet correlated to entry into a surgical career. Future solutions to the lack of diversity in surgery will be predicated on surgeons collectively valuing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Inequities in society and health care combined with underlying structural and systemic racism have demonstrated significant consequences which have resulted in a renewed focus on the current state of diversity in health care and the field of surgery. However, efforts to combat racism and increase diversity and inclusion at all levels in the field of surgery require a comprehensive review, significant commitment, and purposeful action to achieve. These actions must include increasing diversity within training program recruitment, improving retention of minority and under-represented trainees, and implementing inclusive, transparent pathways to promotion, leadership, and involvement in scientific inquiry. This symposium brings together experts in surgery, health equity and policy to address antiracism, diversity, equity, and inclusion in a comprehensive manner ranging from workforce diversity and promotion, pipeline diversity, scholarly pursuits, social and political determinants of health.</ab>

        <ab>Differences in physician income by gender have been described in numerous jurisdictions, but few studies have looked at a Canadian cohort with adjustment for confounders. In this study, we aimed to understand differences in fee-for-service payments to men and women physicians in Ontario.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all Ontario physicians who submitted claims to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) in 2017. For each physician, we gathered demographic information from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario registry. We compared differences in physician claims between men and women in the entire cohort and within each specialty using multivariable linear regressions, controlling for length of practice, specialty and practice location.</ab>
        <ab>We identified a cohort of 30 167 physicians who submitted claims to OHIP in 2017, including 17 992 men and 12 175 women. When controlling for confounding variables in a linear mixed-effects regression model, annual physician claims were $93 930 (95% confidence interval $88 434 to $99 431) higher for men than for women. Women claimed 74% as much as men when adjusting for covariates. This discrepancy was present in nearly all specialty categories. Men claimed more than women throughout their careers, with the greatest gap 10-15 years into practice.</ab>
        <ab>We found a gender gap in fee-for-service claims in Ontario, with women claiming less than men overall and in nearly every specialty. Further work is required to understand the root causes of the gender pay gap.</ab>
        <ab>Competing interests: Alana Flexman reports membership on the diversity, equity and inclusion committees of the Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society and Vancouver Coastal Health. Tara Kiran reports payments from the Ontario Medical Association, the Ontario College of Family Physicians, the Nova Scotia Health Authority, Doctors of BC and the Osgood Hall Law School, outside the submitted work. No other competing interests were declared.</ab>

        <ab>Like many medical specialties, pathology faces the ongoing challenge of effectively enriching diversity, equity, and inclusion within training programs and the field as a whole. This issue is furthered by a decline in US medical student interest in the field of pathology, possibly attributable to increasingly limited pathology exposure during medical school and medical student perceptions about careers in pathology.</ab>
        <ab>To review the literature to identify the challenges to diversity, equity, and inclusion in pathology, with an emphasis on the pathology trainee pipeline. To evaluate the medical education literature from other medical specialties for diversity and inclusion-focused studies and initiatives, and determine the outcomes and/or approaches relevant for pathology training programs.</ab>
        <ab>A literature review was completed by a search of the PubMed database, as well as a similar general Google search. Additional resources, including the Web sites of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Electronic Residency Application Service, and the National Resident Matching Program, were used.</ab>
        <ab>Many strategies exist to increase diversity and encourage an inclusive and equitable training environment, and many of these strategies may be applied to the field of pathology. Interventions such as increasing exposure to the field, using a holistic application review process, and addressing implicit biases have been shown to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in many medical specialties. In addition, increasing access to elective and pipeline programs may help to bolster medical student interest in careers in pathology.</ab>

        <ab>BackgroundPharmacy training programs infrequently include formal training in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Hence, the purpose of this report is to offer perspectives gained from the delivery of a DEI curriculum within a pharmacy residency program aimed at expanding experiential learning focused on DEI and health equity. Program Implementation: Pharmacy residents at an academic medical center were invited to participate in a longitudinal DEI/equity seminar series that was thoughtfully and strategically developed by a team of residents and program leadership based on a six-step process. Residents were offered 9 individual seminars covering 4 major focus areas to facilitate enhanced awareness, learning, and vulnerability. Participants were invited to provide evaluations of each seminar and the overall series. Program Assessment: A total of 41 residents (100%) participated in at least one of the 9 seminars that were offered and approximately 50% completed the post-series survey. Resident-perceived benefit of each individual session was consistently favorable. Additionally, greater than 70% of participants responded favorably when asked about the impact of each session on their awareness, resources provided, and ability to apply the learnings to their practice. Conclusion: Our inaugural experience with the integration of a DEI seminar series into a pharmacy residency program suggests that there is a clear benefit to including DEI/health equity into pharmacy residency training. This data may suggest that adoption of DEI-focused experiential training may increase cultural awareness and the availability of resources to better equip pharmacy residents in applying concepts of DEI into their practice.</ab>

        <ab>Digital technologies are increasingly empowering individuals to take charge of their health and improve their well-being. However, there are disparities in access related to demographic, economic, and sociocultural factors that result in exclusion from the use of digital technologies for different groups of the population. The development of digital technology in health is a powerful lever for improving care and services, but also brings risks for certain users in vulnerable situations. Increased digital health inequalities are associated with limited digital literacy, lack of interest, and low levels of self-efficacy in using technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic healthcare systems, the leap to digital is essential. To foster responsible innovation and optimal use of digital health by all, including vulnerable groups, we propose that patient and citizen engagement must be an essential component of the research strategy. Patient partners will define expectations and establish research priorities using their experiential knowledge, while benefiting from rich exposure to the research process to increase their self-efficacy and digital literacy. We will support this proposition with an operationalised example aiming to implement a Virtual Community of Patients and Citizens Partners (COMVIP), a digital tool co-created with patients and public experts, as active team members in research. Founded on the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion, this base of citizen expertise will assemble individuals from different backgrounds and literacy levels living in vulnerable situations to acquire knowledge, and share their experiences, while contributing actively in the co-development of innovative strategies and health technology assessment.</ab>

        <ab>As worldwide migration continues to grow, valid and reliable instruments are needed to assess the psychological processes that influence the successful management of intercultural relations in different sociopolitical contexts. In this study, we test whether the original Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI) required a revision to remain 'fit for purpose' in the current culturally plural context of the UK (MCI-r). Specifically, six subscales are proposed to underlie the construct of a multicultural ideology: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. With data from 300 UK nationals, we tested the psychometric properties of the MCI-r using various confirmatory factor analysis techniques to estimate the scale's factor structure followed by convergent and discriminant validity tests. The results indicated that a 4-factor solution (Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity) fitted the data best. All four subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity. All four subscales were also negatively correlated with a right-wing political orientation, whilst especially Social Interaction and Consequences of Diversity were positively associated with intergroup contact frequency across domains (work, family and friends and/or acquaintances). Finally, UK participants with personal migratory experiences reported a stronger belief in positive consequences of multiculturalism and more support for Social Interactions between members of different ethnic groups. Overall, findings provide first insights into the applicability of the MCI-r as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of multiculturalism within the present UK context.</ab>

        <ab>Teaching the history of behavior analysis can be approached in many ways. One is to embed history in courses on the field's discipline and subdisciplines (e.g., its basic and applied sciences and their conceptual foundations) and practice. Another is to teach courses on the histories of the discipline and subdisciplines and practice. Still another is to teach a stand-alone course that includes these approaches and more (e.g., their integration, relations with other sciences, the influence of U.S. history and culture). The purpose of this article is to foster teaching the stand-alone course. It has four sections. The first addresses structural considerations: course titles, catalog descriptions, curricula, certification, and accreditation. The second addresses contextual considerations: purposes of teaching history; distinctions between history and historiography; and starting points in selecting textbooks. The third addresses functional considerations: course content organized by topics and their required and recommended readings. The fourth discusses how the course might be revised by eliminating topics (e.g., the Middle Ages), expanding topics and subtopics (e.g., the behaviorisms, philosophy of science) and adding topics and subtopics (e.g., institutional history; diversity, inclusion, and equity). Given the field's continuing development as a science, system, and practice and the rapid growth in its number and variety of its members, its history is becoming its common core-and a means of teaching it. The course elucidates the field's integrity; incorporates the entirety of its community of students, scientists, scholars, and practitioners; and advance its coherence as a cultural practice.</ab>

        <ab>As the field of medical education evolves, there is a need to increase the quality of education scholarship and develop a cadre of research scholars; however, clinician educators (CEs) considering this career transition have limited formal training in education research methodology to heed this call. Therefore, a program that provides more advanced training in education scholarship for CEs without the financial and resource barriers of fellowships and masters programs is needed.</ab>
        <ab>The SAEM Advanced Research Methodology Evaluation and Design in Medical Education (ARMED MedEd) program is a longitudinal program for the beyond-beginner CE, seeking advanced training in education research. The program was created using a comprehensive needs assessment and included longitudinal training; small-group projects; dedicated project mentors; and integrated diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Program participants applied for a grant upon program completion.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-one participants completed the course with 100% completing the baseline survey and 67% (14/21) completing the end-of-program survey. Participants reported improved perception of knowledge across all of the topics with a medium to large effect size, ranging from 0.40 to 0.62. When asked about impact on their network of potential collaborators, participants reported a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-8) out of 9. When asked about the impact on their community of practice, participants reported a median of 7 (IQR 5-7) out of 9. When asked about the impact on their professional identity, participants reported a median of 7 (IQR 4-9) out of 9. Participants also reported an increase in both the quantity (mean of 2 ± 1 new mentors) and the quality (median score 7 [IQR 5-8] out of 9) of new research mentorship as a result of the program. Open-ended feedback was generally positive, with 100% reporting they would advise others to take this program.</ab>
        <ab>The SAEM ARMED MedEd program represents a proof of concept for an advanced education research program seeking to fill the research training gap for the beyond-beginner Clinician educators.</ab>

        <ab>With Antarctic expeditioners popularly portrayed in the media during the pandemic as both heroic stalwarts better equipped than any other people to deal with the rigours of isolation and, paradoxically, the only people untouched by the virus, it was all too easy to ignore the actual experiences of those working in the continent. Drawing on the experiences of expeditioners in the Australian Antarctic Program from 2019-21, this article provides a counter to popular media perspective by exploring how COVID-19 protocols-including quarantine and social distancing-affected expeditioners' individual well-being and their experiences of the social environment. We argue that Antarctic life during COVID-19 has not been as detached from the rest of the world nor as heroic as the popular media has suggested, but nonetheless provides important insights for survival in isolated, confined, and extreme environments (ICE) and non-ICE environments at a time of pandemic.</ab>

        <ab>The lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to hamper the artificial intelligence (AI) field and is especially problematic for healthcare applications. In this article, we expand on the need for diversity, equity, and inclusion, specifically focusing on the composition of AI teams. We call to action leaders at all levels to make team inclusivity and diversity the centerpieces of AI development, not the afterthought. These recommendations take into consideration mitigation at several levels, including outreach programs at the local level, diversity statements at the academic level, and regulatory steps at the federal level.</ab>

        <ab>The National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) seeks to improve upon the translational process to advance research and treatment across all diseases and conditions and bring these interventions to all who need them. Addressing the racial/ethnic health disparities and health inequities that persist in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and health outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality) is central to NCATS' mission to deliver more interventions to all people more quickly. Working toward this goal will require enhancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the translational workforce and in research conducted across the translational continuum, to support health equity. This paper discusses how aspects of DEIA are integral to the mission of translational science (TS). It describes recent NIH and NCATS efforts to advance DEIA in the TS workforce and in the research we support. Additionally, NCATS is developing approaches to apply a lens of DEIA in its activities and research - with relevance to the activities of the TS community - and will elucidate these approaches through related examples of NCATS-led, partnered, and supported activities, working toward the Center's goal of bringing more treatments to all people more quickly.</ab>

        <ab>To achieve a healthier future for all, improving diversity through efforts such as diversifying faculty and leadership in academic medicine is imperative. Therefore, medical trainees (medical students, residents, fellows) from groups underrepresented in medicine (UiM) are encouraged to pursue academic careers and have opportunities to gain faculty leadership skills during their training. Trainees also need exposure to the leadership positions within various offices of an academic institution such as the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The goal of this module is to expose UiM trainees to the Office of DEI and leadership competencies that can be obtained via service and leadership opportunities with it.</ab>
        <ab>The Kern model was used in the development, implementation, and evaluation of this 75-minute workshop. The workshop consisted of a PowerPoint presentation, reflection exercises, and case discussion to raise trainees' awareness of the Office of DEI and opportunities to become engaged with and develop faculty leadership competencies through the office.</ab>
        <ab>Sixty-six diverse learners across three sites completed pre- and postworkshop surveys. Ninety-five percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the learning objectives of the workshop had been met.</ab>
        <ab>Overall, this interactive workshop facilitated learners' awareness of the responsibilities of the Office of DEI and opportunities for learners to develop faculty leadership competencies through engagement. Although primarily evaluated among medical students, the module can be of use to learners and faculty of other health professions programs with an Office of DEI.</ab>

        <ab>The spectrum of bladder health and the factors that promote bladder health and prevent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among women are not well understood. This manuscript describes the rationale, aims, study design, sampling strategy, and data collection for the RISE FOR HEALTH (RISE) study, a novel study of bladder health in women conducted by the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptom (PLUS) Research Consortium.</ab>
        <ab>RISE is a population-based, multicenter, prospective longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling, English- and Spanish-speaking adult women based in the United States. Its goal is to inform the distribution of bladder health and the individual factors (biologic, behavioral, and psychosocial) and multilevel factors (interpersonal, institutional, community, and societal) that promote bladder health and/or prevent LUTS in women across the life course. Key study development activities included the: (1) development of a conceptual framework and philosophy to guide subsequent activities, (2) creation of a study design and sampling strategy, prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, and (3) selection and development of data collection components. Community members and cross-cultural experts shaped and ensured the appropriateness of all study procedures and materials. RISE participants will be selected by simple random sampling of individuals identified by a marketing database who reside in the 50 counties surrounding nine PLUS clinical research centers. Participants will complete self-administered surveys at baseline (mailed paper or electronic) to capture bladder health and LUTS, knowledge about bladder health, and factors hypothesized to promote bladder health and prevent LUTS. A subset of participants will complete an in-person assessment to augment data with objective measures including urogenital microbiome specimens. Initial longitudinal follow-up is planned at 1 year.</ab>
        <ab>Findings from RISE will begin to build the necessary evidence base to support much-needed, new bladder health promotion and LUTS prevention interventions in women.</ab>

        <ab>A total of 108 and 106 fellow and faculty responded to the survey, respectively. The majority of fellows and faculty are female. Less than 3% of fellows and 3.7% of faculty identify as Black. More than 90% of fellows/faculty are heterosexual and no respondents identified as transgender/nonbinary; however, 5% and 2% of all respondents preferred not to disclose their sexual orientation and gender identity, respectively. While 85% of faculty received institutional diversity and inclusion training, 67.6% of fellows did. Fellows are more likely to have received training in health equity than program leaders. Both fellows and program leaders express a high interest in health equity curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>Within the diversity of endocrinology training programs, Black physicians are underrepresented in medicine, which persists in endocrinology fellowships. Fellowship programs express enthusiasm for national diversity and health equity curricula, with the majority of programs reporting institutional DEI training.</ab>

        <ab>As the landscape of philanthropy changes following the COVID-19 pandemic, this commentary considers the future of endowed chairs in academic medicine in the light of articles by Thorndyke and colleagues and by Chin-Hong and colleagues in this issue. The authors evaluate the traditional allocation of endowed chairs, which can attract and retain talented faculty and can support focused research far into the future, while other gifts may support more timely concerns, but over a shorter term. The authors weigh the benefits and challenges of allocation of endowed chairs, such as the need to improve representation, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and opportunities to support early-career investigators or research teams. New endowed positions can be challenging to establish, as there may be competition with learner scholarship programs and programmatic support. Leadership turnover of university presidents and deans can slow philanthropic growth and make recruitment and fundraising for new positions even more challenging. The authors discuss the balance of institutional priorities and ways to use endowed chairs for scholarship in evolving areas of medicine and science. They further suggest working with donors to develop more adaptable gift agreements, which will allow institutions to transform endowed positions to meet changing needs while preserving the intentions of the donor. To maintain endowed chairs as a worthwhile and relevant outlet for philanthropy, one which donors will enthusiastically support, it is essential to align them with the changing needs of the institution and the broader environment of academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Despite documented racial and ethnic disparities in care, there is significant variability in representation, reporting, and analysis of race and ethnic groups in the hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) literature.</ab>
        <ab>To evaluate the race and ethnic diversity of study participants and the reporting of race and ethnicity data in HPM research.</ab>
        <ab>Adult patient and/or caregiver-centered research conducted in the U.S. and published as JPSM Original Articles from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2019, were identified. Descriptive analyses were used to summarize the frequency of variables related to reporting of race and ethnicity.</ab>
        <ab>Of 1253 studies screened, 218 were eligible and reviewed. There were 78 unique race and ethnic group labels. Over 85% of studies included ≥ one non-standard label based on Office of Management and Budget designations. One-quarter of studies lacked an explanation of how race and ethnicity data were collected, and 83% lacked a rationale. Over half did not include race and/or ethnicity in the analysis, and only 14 studies focused on race and/or ethnic health or health disparities. White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons were included in 95%, 71%, 43% 37%,10%, and 4% of studies. In 92% of studies the proportion of White individuals exceeded 57.8%, which is their proportion in the U.S.</ab>
        <ab>Our findings suggest there are important opportunities to standardize reporting of race and ethnicity, strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion among research participants, and prioritize the study of racial and ethnic disparities in HPM research.</ab>

        <ab>Meaningful Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) efforts may be stymied by concerns about whether proposed initiatives are performative or tokenistic. The purpose of this project was to analyze discussions by the Research in Medical Education (RIME) Program Planning committee about how best to recognize and support underrepresented in medicine (URiM) researchers in medical education to generate lessons learned that might inform local, national, and international actions to implement meaningful EDI initiatives. Ten RIME Program Planning Committee members and administrative staff participated in a focus group held virtually in August 2021. Focus group questions elicited opinions about "if and how" to establish a URiM research award. The focus group was recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Recognition of privilege, including who has it and who doesn't, underpinned the focus group discussion, which revolved around 2 themes: (1) tensions between optics and semantics, and (2) potential unintended consequences of trying to level the medical education playing field. The overarching storyline threaded throughout the focus group discussion was intentionality. Focus group participants sought to avoid performativity by creating an award that would be meaningful to recipients and to career gatekeepers such as department chairs and promotion and tenure committees. Ultimately, participants decided to create an award that focused on exemplary Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) scholarship, which was eventually named the "RIME URiM Research Award." Difficult but productive conversations about EDI initiatives are necessary to advance underrepresented in medicine (URiM) scholarship. This transparent commentary may trigger further critical conversations.</ab>

        <ab>Across the last several years, numerous surgical departments and societies have focused on addressing the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the field. Since the Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) Diversity and Inclusion Taskforce was created in 2017 (and solidified as a formal committee in 2018, herein referred to as the APDS-DIC), it has sought to address gaps in diversity at various phases of training and development from medical student to surgical leader.</ab>
        <ab>In follow-up to a 2018 study that benchmarked leadership demographics of the APDS, this study analyzed how the APDS' efforts have aligned with recommended DEI strategies and whether this produced demographic changes in organizational leadership.</ab>
        <ab>Fifteen years (2008-2022) of publicly available APDS annual meeting program data and APDS membership lists were analyzed. Leadership positions in the organization were examined by officer, program/vice chair, executive committee, and board of directors. A 2-tailed T-test compared differences in the average proportion of leaders from specific demographic groups before and after the APDS-DIC inception (2008-2016 vs. 2017-2022).</ab>
        <ab>APDS has 724 unique faculty and 140 resident members. The majority of both groups identified as White (68% of faculty and 58% of residents). Over 15 years, there have been 307 available leadership positions held by 67 individuals. All presidents and president-elect positions have been held by White surgeons; nearly 80% have been men. The average proportion of female leaders and the average proportion of racial/ethnic minority leaders were both significantly higher after implementation of the APDS-DIC in 2017 (p=0.0009 for gender and p=0.036 for racial/ethnic minorities).</ab>
        <ab>The APDS' commitment to DEI efforts and establishment of the APDS-DIC in 2017 was associated with a significant increase in women and non-White minorities in organizational leadership positions. The specific role of the APDS-DIC in propelling surgeons from underrepresented groups into leadership and promoting key DEI efforts is broadly applicable to other surgical organizations.</ab>

        <ab>To plan for an expansion of healthcare services in newly developed neighbourhoods, a planning initiative was conducted to better understand the needs of the population. Ensuring equity of care was identified as a priority for this initiative. To evaluate how closely the planning adhered to the principles of health equity, we applied Ontario Health's Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, and Anti-Racism Framework to determine which areas of action were successfully addressed, and which areas of action require further focus. The framework contains 11 components, each delineating a key area of action. Using this framework helped identify areas where the principles of equity were well addressed, as well as pointing to additional areas where further efforts are required. Healthcare organizations must take a leadership role in advancing health equity by planning, delivering, improving, and advocating for the services and systematic changes that will allow its local community members to realize their highest attainable standard of health. Using such a framework can help develop strategic approaches to advancing equity.</ab>

        <ab>This essay argues that we should treat science and risk communicators' choices about tactics, objectives, and goals as behaviors to advance both research and practice. Doing so allows for a discussion about how to use theories about behavior change and trust-building to help foster more strategic communication choices. The essay also seeks to anticipate and respond to potential arguments against using behavior change theories to encourage more strategic communication choices. We argue that it is possible to use behavior change tactics ethically if those tactics are aimed at increasing the likelihood that all participants in communication-including decisions makers like risk scientists-meaningfully engage with true, relevant information. Under the right conditions, such engagement is what should allow for the development of new knowledge, as well as a range of evidence-based evaluative beliefs, feelings, and frames. Being strategic when making choices about communication should also help with identifying situations in which justice, equity, diversity, or inclusion issues require additional attention. The essay concludes by noting that the difficulty of efficient and effective science and risk communication may require increased emphasis on getting experts such as scientists to collaborate with expert communication advisors. It may also be necessary to increase the capacity of science- and risk-focused communication practitioners.</ab>

        <ab>Endowed chairs and professorships are prestigious and financially important awards that symbolize individual faculty recognition. However, data about the gender distribution of these positions are lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine the gender distribution of endowed positions at U.S. medical schools and identify strategies that have been used to promote investiture of women into these positions.</ab>
        <ab>The authors interrogated the websites for all U.S. medical schools for publicly available data. Of 38 schools that listed schoolwide information, they analyzed data from the 30 with at least 10 endowed positions. Then, they conducted interviews with deans of the 10 schools with the highest percentages of women holding endowed positions ("top 10") to understand the strategies they used to increase gender equity in this area.</ab>
        <ab>The percentage of endowed positions held by women at the 30 schools analyzed ranged from 10.8% to 34.6%, with a mean of 21.6%. Themes that emerged from interviews with deans included (1) intentionality to identify women candidates in the selection process, (2) monitoring the numbers of women holding endowed positions, (3) inclusion of endowed positions as part of larger institutional goals on gender equity and diversity, (4) use of endowed positions to recruit, retain, and recognize women faculty, (5) purposeful fundraising to increase the number of endowed positions, and (6) institutional investment of resources to develop women faculty.</ab>
        <ab>Analysis of the gender distribution of endowed positions across 30 representative U.S. medical schools revealed a significant gender disparity. Interviews with deans at the top 10 schools revealed strategies that they have used to promote equity in this important area. Implementation of a systematic national reporting process could provide schools with comparative data to gauge their progress.</ab>

        <ab>The shaping of a new field to encompass health formulations and practices on a planetary scale must consider the multiple agents and territories involved and their differences and inequalities. The inclusion of different social segments in the decision-making processes and theoretical elaboration of Global Health, through participation, is presented as a strategic and necessary condition for facing transnational issues. This participation ensures political and epistemic diversity in establishing a global health committed to Global Health equity. The Latin American tradition that articulates research and action and the proposal for the Knowledge Meeting can contribute to participatory processes of constituting the field of Global Health in its practical and theoretical aspects.</ab>

        <ab>Only 13.1% of US registered dietitian nutritionists and 27.8% of students enrolled in US dietetics education programs identify as racially/ethnically diverse individuals. National demographic trends show increasing percentages of racially/ethnically diverse individuals within the broader US and college student populations; however, these changes have not been mirrored within dietetics. Dietetics educators have an ethical and professional mandate to address diversity, equity, and inclusion within their programs. This paper reviews key terminology related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the context of dietetics education, and describes a new framework to transform dietetics education based on the principles of cultural humility and culturally sustaining teaching. Strategies are presented to facilitate recruitment, admissions, retention, and mentorship for racially/ethnically diverse students and faculty, and to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion within curricula and classrooms. Lastly, this paper provides clear practice applications, including recommendations for program policy change and training/skill building activities for dietetics students, educators, and preceptors.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to characterize the nondiscrimination and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements found on the websites of general surgery residency programs, as well as to measure programmatic commitment to diversity through their involvement with special interest surgical societies (SISS).</ab>
        <ab>The authors evaluated the relationship between DEI statements and SISS participation, and performed a natural language processing analysis of general surgery residency DEI statements.</ab>
        <ab>The residency program websites from 319 non-military general surgery residency programs within the United States were analyzed.</ab>
        <ab>This study evaluated the DEI statement and SISS participation in general surgery residency programs.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 319 general surgery residency websites reviewed, 127 (39.8%) featured an identifiable statement of nondiscrimination or commitment to diversity. Compared to programs without diversity statements, programs with statements were more likely to be involved with special interest surgical societies (53.5% vs 30.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Natural language processing analysis revealed that the diversity statements of programs with SISS involvement had higher word counts (p = 0.001), higher clout scores (measure of confidence conveyed, p = 0.001), and higher positive tone scores (p = 0.006) compared with the statements of those without special interest society involvement.</ab>
        <ab>In the era of virtual interviewing, applicants are forced to rely heavily on surgery residency websites as their main source of information. Less than 40% of programs participating in the Match in 2022 feature diversity statements on their websites. Programs with some degree of involvement with special interest societies were more likely to have statements that score higher in confidence and positivity in natural language processing analysis, which may potentially reflect a more earnest commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Residency programs should continue to improve the visibility of their DEI efforts to recruit a diverse resident class.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare professions are among the fastest growing careers in the United States, but the issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion remain a challenge. The percentage of underrepresented minority groups is disproportionately small despite many efforts to increase workforce diversity over the past several decades. As the demographics in our nation are rapidly changing, increasing racial, ethnic, and cognitive diversity is crucial to achieving a workforce with the capacity to provide accessible and equitable healthcare. Given the growing evidence that a diverse workforce improves healthcare outcomes, fosters unique perspectives (cognitive diversity), and helps to reduce health disparities, there is an urgent need to address perennial barriers such as structural racism, biases, and stereotypes. Educational institutions should be held accountable to integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of healthcare professions education and practice. This article discusses potential areas for innovation and opportunities that can be leveraged in assessing and benchmarking equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare professions. The ability to thoroughly assess the PA profession's culture in relationship to diversity, equity, and inclusion provides an opportunity to determine how well the profession is performing, and to strategically plan for what else need to be done.</ab>

        <ab>Diverse perspectives are critical components of effective teams in every industry. Underrepresentation of minorities in medicine leads to worse outcomes for minority patients, and efforts to increase diversity in the health care workforce are critical. Presently, about 70% of the pediatric surgery workforce is white, and pediatric surgeons at large do not reflect the racial or ethnic diversity of the populations they serve. Pediatric surgery fellowship training programs are the gateway to the field, and fellow selection processes should be optimized to support diversity and inclusion. The Association of Pediatric Surgery Training Program Directors (APSTPD) Diversity Equity and Inclusion subcommittee compiled best practices for bias mitigation during fellow selection, drawing from published literature and personal experiences in our own programs. A list of concrete recommendations was compiled, which can be implemented in every phase from applicant screening to rank list creation. We present these as a position statement that has been endorsed by the executive committee of the APSTPD. Pediatric surgery fellowship programs can utilize this focused review of best practices to mitigate bias and support diverse applicants.</ab>

        <ab>Two events converged in early 2020 to expose vast disparities and inequities that have been harming many racialized and marginalized people for decades and shake up healthcare systems around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and the brutal killing by police of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, created a groundswell of emotions that erupted in protests and calls for social justice. Governments, corporations, and businesses made statements against racism, primarily anti-Black racism, instituted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, and appointed DEI managers to show they were taking action to tackle racism and uphold social justice. However, grassroots community organizations had the most impact in mobilizing populations and effecting change to contain and reduce the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus, as well as challenging leaders to do more than just talk about dismantling systemic, structural, and institutional racism.</ab>

        <ab>Prevention is a cornerstone of the guiding mission of the University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is "to reduce the burden of cancer for the patients of today, through skilled, integrated, and compassionate care and to eliminate the threat of cancer for the patients of tomorrow, through research and education in an environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion." We find it useful to conceptualize different opportunities for cancer prevention using NCI's Health Behaviors Research Branch's multilevel translational framework. The latter considers three intersecting continuums: cancer control-from prevention through survivorship; translation-from basic sciences to dissemination and implementation; and level of influence or impact-from genetics to policy. An advantage of this heuristic is that "prevention" is inherently defined as an inter-programmatic concept cutting across basic, clinical, and population science research rather than solely as a programmatic domain of Population Sciences. Through the UVA community outreach and engagement, we apply this multilevel framework to mitigate the social determinants of cancer risk and outcomes that drive cancer inequities in our catchment area. Below, we provide examples of our prevention research and translation along the model continuums and focus on equity.</ab>

        <ab>In 2019 the majority of US medical students were women (50.5%). However, despite this representation, female representation within orthopaedic surgery remains low when compared to male counterparts. Previously, the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) and Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) published their gender diversity data. No such study has been conducted in the American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS), which is the largest membership organization for foot and ankle-trained orthopaedic surgeons. This study sought to investigate whether increased female representation in the AOFAS membership roster is reflected in different levels within the organization.</ab>
        <ab>The 2012-2022 membership rosters were obtained from the AOFAS and compared by gender. Volunteer, elected, and appointed leadership positions as well as rates of engagement were compared for each of the activities. Leadership positions were defined as committee chair, vice chair, or board of directors (BOD). When available, time for advancement through leadership positions to the presidential role was analyzed by gender. Comparative data were available for 2 other respective subspecialty groups, ASSH and POSNA, from previously published studies.</ab>
        <ab>Between 2012 and 2022, the percentage of female membership in the AOFAS has continued to increase from 7.5% (n=76) to 13% (n=163). Engagement in committee membership positions during this time has more than doubled from 11 of 26 (14.4%) to 57 of 163 (34.9%). When participation trends were evaluated by gender, women showed higher rates of committee involvement than their male counterparts. In 2021 compared to 2012, the percentage of female committee members more than doubled compared with their male counterparts (female 34.9% to male 23.2% vs female 14.4% to male 16.8%). This increase in female gender committee composition trend has been seen in the ASSH and POSNA, but it is more pronounced in the AOFAS. Representation of women in committee chair positions and elected positions has not seen this same parallel increase.</ab>
        <ab>The female membership of the AOFAS has a similar gender composition to other orthopaedic subspecialities. Female membership within the society has increased over the past 10 years. The rates of female involvement within committee membership positions have seen a parallel increase. It will take time to mature into leadership roles as we continue to increase diversity within our respective subspecialty organizations. Inception of the AOFAS Diversity Equity and Inclusion and Women's Subcommittee demonstrate a continued emphasis on this core value within the society.</ab>

        <ab>Patients are increasingly encouraged to participate in health research programs as partners, with the aim to ensure that studies address their priorities. In response, the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) has been created in Canada to transform the patient's role in research from a passive beneficiary to a more proactive partner of change within the healthcare system. This research investigates what people new to Canada living with type 2 diabetes think about participating in research partnerships. Using an ethnographic approach, 31 people new to Canada with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were interviewed. Findings indicated that few people new to Canada were represented among the Diabetes Action Canada (DAC) Network's Circles of Patient Partners in Quebec. Barriers to engagement in research were: lack of information; competing priorities; language barrier and privacy concerns; preconceptions about being a patient partner; prejudices on research engagement as something demanding and binding; and the matter of religious and gender differences. Some participants questioned the extent to which involvement in research can really meet their expectations considering institutional control over research, funding requirements that often dictate priorities and the biomedical approach which still, in many respects, dominates health research. Implications for achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion of patient partners in research are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>The murder of George Floyd created national outcry that echoed down to national institutions, including universities and academic systems to take a hard look at systematic and systemic racism in higher education. This motivated the creation of a fear and tension-minimizing, curricular offering, " Courageous Conversations," collaboratively engaging students, staff, and faculty in matters of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics at the University of Florida.</ab>
        <ab>A qualitative design was employed assessing narrative feedback from participants during the Fall semester of 2020. Additionally, the ten-factor model implementation framework was applied and assessed. Data collection included two focus groups and document analysis with member-checking. Thematic analysis (i.e., organizing, coding, synthesizing) was used to analyze a priori themes based on the four agreements of the courageous conversations framework, stay engaged, expect to experience discomfort, speak your truth, and expect and accept non-closure.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 41 participants of which 20 (48.78%) were department staff members, 11 (26.83%) were department faculty members, and 10 (24.30%) were graduate students. The thematic analysis revealed 1) that many participants credited their learning experiences to what their peers had said about their own personal lived experiences during group sessions, and 2) several participants said they would either retake the course or recommend it to a colleague.</ab>
        <ab>With structured implementation, courageous conversations can be an effective approach to create more diverse, equitable, and inclusive spaces in training programs with similar DEI ecosystems.</ab>

        <ab>Please see the Editorial Comment by Anand K. Narayan discussing this article. Radiology practices nationwide have implemented diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs seeking to change the landscape of a field traditionally dominated by White men. However, measuring these programs' success is often challenging, and a lack of documented success may threaten such programs' ongoing growth. This article explores the application of metrics and overall concepts from the business world to assess the success of DEI programs in radiology practices. Metrics and processes are described for each area, including demographic data for measuring diversity, compensation and leadership representation data for measuring equity, and survey-based data for measuring inclusion. A practical data-driven framework is presented that radiology practices may adapt to their DEI programs. This framework is centered on critical assessment of a practice's current shortcomings and creation of leadership accountability to track progress and effect real change. Through the spectrum of considerations highlighted in this article, DEI programs can have a large impact in driving measurable success for radiology practices and ultimately the specialty at large.</ab>

        <ab>The woefully low proportion of scientists and clinicians underrepresented in medicine (UIM), including members of African-American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities, is well characterized and documented. Diversity in medicine is not only just, but it improves quality and outcomes. Yet, diversity in academic medicine remains stagnant, despite national recognition and urgent calls to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion across health sciences. One strategy that has shown to improve diversity in many sectors is high quality mentoring. While many institutions have adopted mentoring programs, there remains a lack of mentorship that is equitable, individualized, and sets a clear timeline for academic milestones that will position UIM mentees at the optimal trajectory for promotion and retention. A barrier to assembling these programs is the small number of UIM among the senior faculty ranks who are able to serve in this role, given the disproportionate burden to serve on a multitude of academic committees, task forces, and workgroups to fulfill institutional mandates to diversify representation. These time-consuming services, documented in the literature as the "minority tax," are generally uncompensated and unaccounted for in terms of consideration for promotion, leadership positions, and other measures of career advancement. The Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Academic Mentors (JAM) Council represents a novel, culturally responsive, and anti-racist approach to achieve a more equitable and inclusive institutional environment. This approach strategically leverages the intergenerational wisdom and experience of senior UIM faculty via time-protected effort with the overall goals of improving rates of promotion, retention, and career satisfaction of early career UIM colleagues. This community case study describes the rationale, resources needed, processes, and proposed workflow required to launch the JAM Council, as well as the major roles and responsibilities for JAM mentors and mentees, which may be considered by academic medical centers focused on improving diversity among the faculty ranks.</ab>

        <ab>The opioid epidemic is one of the biggest public health crises of our time, and overprescribing of opioids after surgery has the potential to lead to long-term use. The purpose of this review was to identify and summarize the available evidence on interventions aimed at reducing opioid use after orthopedic surgery.</ab>
        <ab>We searched CENTRAL, Embase and Medline from inception until August 2019 for studies comparing interventions aimed at reducing opioid use after orthopedic surgery to a control group. We recorded demographic data and data on intervention success, and recorded or calculated percent opioid reduction compared to control.</ab>
        <ab>We included 141 studies (20 963 patients) in the review, of which 113 (80.1%) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 (4.3%) were prospective cohort studies, 16 (11.4%) were retrospective cohort studies, 5 (3.6%) were case reports, and 1 (0.7%) was a case series. The majority of studies (95 [67.4%]) had a follow-up duration of 2 days or less. Interventions included the use of local anesthetics and/or nerve blocks (42 studies [29.8%]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (31 [22.0%]), neuropathic pain medications (9 [6.4%]) and multimodal analgesic combinations (25 [17.7%]. In 127 studies (90.1%), a significant decrease in postoperative opioid consumption compared to the control intervention was reported; the median opioid reduction in these studies was 39.7% (range 5%-100%). Despite these reductions in opioid use, the effect on pain scores and on incidence of adverse effects was inconsistent.</ab>
        <ab>There is a large body of evidence from randomized trials showing the promise of a variety of interventions for reducing opioid use after orthopedic surgery. Rigorously designed RCTs are needed to determine the ideal interventions or combination of interventions for reducing opioid use, for the good of patients, medicine and society.</ab>

        <ab>This study describes a quality improvement (QI) process to reduce bias and increase inclusion and equity in the recruitment of health service psychology interns in an American Psychological Association-accredited psychology internship program at a national children's hospital.</ab>
        <ab>This QI project utilized two Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles targeting the application review and the interview processes primarily using supervisor engagement and feedback to inform these processes. The goal of the PDSA cycles was to increase diversity in psychology doctoral interns offered interviews and ultimately recruited to the internship program.</ab>
        <ab>The application rating form was revised to place a greater emphasis on factors related to diversity, such as increasing the number of points applicants could earn for being bilingual. Regarding the interview process, structured interview questions were created, and a new, unified rubric was used to score interviewees. The changes in demographics of applicants selected for interviews and feedback from applicants who interviewed are reported.</ab>
        <ab>The QI process resulted in tangible changes to improve equitable and inclusive internship recruitment. Lessons learned throughout this process included the need for continual auditing of practices through an equity lens, engaging supervisors at all stages of the process, and implementing incremental actions.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are important values in health care and academic medicine. Although women have comprised nearly 50% of all US medical school graduates since the early 2000s, gender disparities continue in many specialties and persist in medical education leadership. For women in anesthesiology, gender inequities exist along the academic pipeline, with greater disparity in the higher ranks of academia and leadership. Successful endeavors to improve gender equity in the specialty include increasing awareness, engaging in faculty development, and encouraging transparent promotions processes. The strides will be short and change will be slow unless we shift focus to when the gender imbalance begins-at the transition from undergraduate medical education to graduate medical education. Currently women comprise 37% of academic anesthesiology faculty; however, the current resident pool is only 33% women. If recruitment of a gender-equitable workforce at the undergraduate-to-graduate medical education transition is not a priority, the downstream measures will have minimal impact toward gender equity in academic anesthesiology.</ab>

        <ab>Underrepresented voices and perspectives are missing from academic and clinical health sciences. We aimed to define the unique opportunities and challenges of pediatric clinician-scientists related to equity, diversity and inclusion; and to identify key components of training needed to support people from equity-seeking groups as emerging and early-career pediatric clinician-scientists to generate diverse health research leaders in knowledge generation, implementation and translation.</ab>
        <ab>Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we examined the experiences of clinician stakeholders. Semistructured interviews were conducted with pediatric clinician-scientist stakeholders. Thematic analysis was performed.</ab>
        <ab>We interviewed a total of 39 individuals. Our analysis resulted in 4 interrelated themes: the pervasiveness and invisibility of sexism; the invisibility and visibility of racism; proposed individual-level solutions to the sexism and racism; and proposed institutional and system-level changes to address the porous and leaky pipeline. These themes acknowledged that, ultimately, system change is required for addressing equity, diversity and inclusion in clinical and academic training environments.</ab>
        <ab>These findings highlight the importance of addressing systemic biases that limit the inclusion of women and racialized individuals in pediatric clinician-scientist careers. Further research is needed to explore the problem of exclusion, which will, in turn, inform education of pediatric clinician-scientists and inform better ways to promote equity, diversity and inclusivity; these steps are needed to foster systemic change in the cultures that perpetuate exclusivity in both academic and clinical communities.</ab>

        <ab>Throughout history, armies of the world have codified grooming standards for their members. In the USA, the Department of Defense (DoD) provides overall guidance for grooming standards and each uniformed military service develops, promulgates, and enforces its own grooming standards. The specific details of each service's grooming standards are revised regularly to conform to contemporaneous notions of professionalism and operational necessity. In light of growing recognition of and respect for the diversity of people serving in the military, specific language used to describe certain hairstyles and hair textures as well as associated grooming policies have gained attention. Efforts have been made to modify the policy and language to be more inclusive, especially of minority groups with physiologic and cultural differences that influence grooming practices. Initial efforts in the DoD toward this endeavor were made possible with advocacy from members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</ab>
        <ab>We obtained service-specific documents, current and former, from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps that regulate the grooming standards for military personnel. We then examined the documents for text that addressed hair and hairstyles, specifically noting language describing and regulations regarding traditionally Black or African American hairstyles (i.e., afros, dreadlocks/locks/locs, braids, twists, etc.) for female and male soldiers. We also examined recently introduced legislation which seeks to end discrimination based on a person's hair texture or hairstyle, "Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act," abbreviated as the CROWN Act in the context of current grooming standards.</ab>
        <ab>Our examination of the grooming regulations of four branches of the U.S. Military shows recent modifications of the language governing female hairstyles, particularly natural hairstyles seen among African American women, such as cornrows, braids, and locs (or locks). Changes made to grooming standards demonstrate a shift in language used to describe natural hairstyles. Words with negative connotations (i.e., "matted," "unkempt," and "dreadlock") have been removed. These have been replaced with more descriptive language that provides a more objective definition of certain hairstyles. While these hairstyles have some level of regulation as to exact dimensions and styling rules to fit with the goal of uniformity in appearance and do not extend to male service members, recent updates in grooming standards have expanded to be inclusive of these natural hairstyles. Recent changes in language and policy in the military have been noted as positive examples in the CROWN Act.</ab>
        <ab>The DoD has recognized that former grooming standards, specifically regarding hair and hairstyles, may have introduced inequities in the treatment of military personnel. The DoD and its component military services have long been engaged in programs to ensure equal protections among its workforces. The re-examination and clarification of grooming standards related to hair and hairstyles is another effort to ensure equity and inclusion. The military services are working with great sincerity to implement policies that promote inclusiveness broadly. Steps to remove discrimination on the basis of hair and hairstyle can make the overall work environment more inclusive for people of color. Passage of a federal CROWN Act will promote similar or parallel changes for federal employees outside the military services.</ab>

        <ab>In 2020, the combination of police killings of unarmed Black people, including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about public outrage over long-standing inequalities in society. The events of 2020 ignited global attention to systemic racism and racial inequalities, including the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy and especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Racial and ethnic diversity in graduate programs in particular warrants special attention as graduate students of color report experiencing alarming rates of racism, discrimination, microaggressions, and other exclusionary behaviors. As part of the Graduate Dean's Advisory Council on Diversity (GDACD) at the University of California Merced, the authors of this manuscript held a year-long discussion on these issues and ways to take meaningful action to address these persistent issues of injustices. We have outlined 10 rules to help graduate programs develop antiracist practices to promote racial and ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in the academy. We focus on efforts to address systemic causes of the underrepresentation and attrition of students from minoritized communities. The 10 rules are developed to allow graduate groups to formulate and implement rules and policies to address root causes of underrepresentation of minoritized students in graduate education.</ab>

        <ab>Prevention is a cornerstone of the guiding mission of the University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is "to reduce the burden of cancer for the patients of today, through skilled, integrated, and compassionate care and to eliminate the threat of cancer for the patients of tomorrow, through research and education in an environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion." We find it useful to conceptualize different opportunities for cancer prevention using NCI's Health Behaviors Research Branch's multilevel translational framework. The latter considers three intersecting continuums: cancer control-from prevention through survivorship; translation-from basic sciences to dissemination and implementation; and level of influence or impact-from genetics to policy. An advantage of this heuristic is that "prevention" is inherently defined as an inter-programmatic concept cutting across basic, clinical, and population science research rather than solely as a programmatic domain of Population Sciences. Through the UVA community outreach and engagement, we apply this multilevel framework to mitigate the social determinants of cancer risk and outcomes that drive cancer inequities in our catchment area. Below, we provide examples of our prevention research and translation along the model continuums and focus on equity.</ab>

        <ab>The World Health Organization Caregiver Skills Training Program (WHO-CST) was developed to strengthen caregivers' skills in supporting children with developmental delays and the caregivers' well-being. The WHO-CST Hong Kong (HK) was adapted, and pre-pilot tested to support families with children suspected of having developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder and to empower the caregivers to foster their children's learning, social communication, and adaptive behavior. A sequential mixed-methods research methodology was undertaken to examine the adaptation process and initial implementation experiences. The acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits of the WHO-CST were assessed using stakeholders' and caregivers' qualitative and caregivers' quantitative pre- and post-intervention feedback. The data included materials generated from (1) three consultation meetings with stakeholders; (2) detailed reviews of the translated and adapted WHO-CST materials by master trainees (n = 10) trained by the WHO-CST representatives; (3) needs assessment focus group interviews with caregivers (n = 15) of children with autism spectrum disorder; and (4) pre- and post-CST program qualitative focus group interviews and quantitative evaluation. Consultation with stakeholders suggested that the program was acceptable for the local community, but the home visit and fidelity components were initially considered to be challenges towards the feasibility and sustainability of the program. Caregivers in the needs assessment focus groups gave widely diverse views about the program's uniqueness, length, delivery mode, and the inclusion of videotaping in-home visits. Post-intervention comments by caregivers about the program were mainly positive, while the MTs were critical of the content and length of the training and fidelity process. As one of the first high-income locations to adopt the WHO-CST, the evaluation findings of the WHO-CST-HK indicate that it is feasible and acceptable to implement the program in a metropolitan area where families have busy work schedules and are very conscious of privacy issues. The study results suggest that the WHO-CST program in HK and other high-income countries require scaling up and further evaluation of its implementation in real community settings. This involves systemic and contextual changes to allow task-sharing between professionals and non-specialists at the macro level. Furthermore, technology should be used to support the supervision of non-specialists. In addition, easier access to the WHO-CST materials at the micro level is required to ensure equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion of diversified families of children with developmental delays.</ab>

        <ab>Black students remain underrepresented in medicine despite national efforts to increase diversity in the physician workforce. Historically Black College and University (HBCU) students play a vital role in increasing representation in the workforce. Currently, there is a paucity of literature understanding the impact of COVID-19 on premedical students from HBCUs. Understanding the adverse impact of the pandemic on HBCU students is essential to inform strategies that promote holistic medical school admissions and increased diversity, equity, and inclusion in the medical workforce.</ab>
        <ab>To explore premedical advisors' perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HBCU premedical students pursuing admission to medical school.</ab>
        <ab>In this qualitative study, semistructured interviews of HBCU premedical advisors were performed from March 2020 to March 2021. One-on-one interviews were conducted with 21 advisors with a depth of experience as advisors, varied educational backgrounds, and diverse geographic representation. Data analysis was performed from March 2021 to December 2021.</ab>
        <ab>The experiences of HBCU premedical students during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the premedical advisor.</ab>
        <ab>Among the 21 participants, 13 (62%) were female, 15 (71%) were Black or African American, 11 (52%) had a doctorate degree, and 7 (33%) had more than 10 years of experience as advisors. Participants described 3 major themes: (1) balancing academic responsibilities with family demands; (2) distraction, disruption, and isolation in the virtual learning environment; and (3) harmful impact of new stressors for HBCU applicants in the medical school admissions process.</ab>
        <ab>In this qualitative study of HBCU advisors to premedical students, advisors described how the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected undergraduate HBCU premedical students; students faced family hardships, challenges with virtual learning, and uncertainty in the medical school admissions process. These findings suggest that medical schools should continue to create direct interventions to address the challenges that HBCU students faced during the height of the pandemic and as longitudinal consequences of the pandemic. Addressing these issues may improve physician workforce representation and promote more equitable patient care for underserved communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and other health disparities.</ab>

        <ab>The editorship of medical journals is a leadership role that can affect recognition and career advancement. We determine the gender representation of the editorial boards of oculoplastic surgery journals in comparison to the proportion of women in oculoplastics societies.</ab>
        <ab>The gender composition of the American, European and Asia-Pacific societies of oculoplastic and reconstructive surgery and the editorial boards of their respective society journals were determined with online searches in March 2021. Statistical tests for the equality of proportions were performed.</ab>
        <ab>Excluding 44 individuals with missing gender data, the three combined oculoplastics societies comprised 1,230 distinct members, with 29% women. The editorial review boards of the three official society publications comprised 59 medical editors, 22% of which were women. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of women editors versus women OPRS members ( p = .201) but the study is underpowered to detect a 7% difference. A sensitivity analysis with the missing data did not alter the conclusions. The mean h-index/m-quotient of the women editors was 20.50/0.87 and for the men 21.05/0.84, with no statistically significant difference ( p = .903/0.851).</ab>
        <ab>Women are underrepresented on the editorial boards of oculoplastic journals. Possible methods to improve gender balance include multicriteria objective decision-making criteria for editor nominations, mentoring peer reviewers that are women, and appointing a journal editor for equity, diversity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Disparities in surgical outcomes are well documented. Racial/ethnic minorities are also disproportionately underrepresentated in surgery; however, most surgeons do not acknowledge the existence of disparities. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) education in surgery is needed, yet DEI education is often confined to designated diversity lectures, limiting depth of content. Underrepresented minorities (URMs) are also more likely to be tasked with leading DEI initiatives, perpetuating the minority tax and limiting non-URM engagement.</ab>
        <ab>A DEI curriculum was implemented in a general surgery department, inclusive of programming at morbidity and mortality (M&amp;M) and grand rounds (GR).</ab>
        <ab>After implementing a DEI curriculum there was a significant increase in DEI topics at M&amp;M (0% versus 27.3%; p &lt; 0.01) and GR (0% versus 18.4%; p &lt; 0.001). The majority of DEI M&amp;Ms were presented by non-URMs (88.89%). Most DEI GR were presented by URMs (55%).</ab>
        <ab>Structured integration of DEI initiatives into surgery department conferences may serve as a practical approach to increasing departmental awareness of disparities, expanding DEI engagement, and increasing academic recognition for DEI initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>Our aim was to identify gender and racial disparities in presidential leadership for national medical and surgical organizations.</ab>
        <ab>We located publicly sourced information on national medical organizations. Years between or since the first diverse presidents were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Mann Whitney U tests.</ab>
        <ab>Sixty-seven national medical and surgical organizations were surveyed. 70.8% (n = 34) diversified via gender first (White-female), whereas 26.1% (n = 14) had racial diversity first. Organizations with gender diversity first followed with an African American male president sooner than organizations who first diversified by race (14.7 ± 11.8 v. 27.6 ± 11.3 years, p = 0.018). No significant difference was observed for the third tier of diversification.</ab>
        <ab>Significant gender and racial leadership disparities in national medical organizations are still present. It is notable that organizations with female leaders had a shorter timeline to racial diversity. These findings help to inform strategies to promote and increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in national leadership.</ab>

        <ab>This article offers a summary, synthesis, and highlights of processes, surveys, summits, and discussions among members of the Society for the Study of School Psychology exploring current and historical perspectives as to a potential definition of school psychology research. After multiple revisions, the final definition is as follows: School psychology research is the systematic investigation of phenomena concerning the educational, emotional, behavioral, and social outcomes, as well as the school, family, and societal systems in which these outcomes are imbedded. It is principally concerned with socially responsive implementation and translating research into equitable practices that can lead to improved functioning of students, families, schools, and community systems that support educational and psychological services. It includes basic and applied research and theory development that focuses on a wide array of topics including, for example, prevention, intervention, assessment, diagnosis, diversity, equity and inclusion, measurement, methodology, statistics, and professional issues. This wide range of topics is informed by diverse theories arising from a broad array of disciplines and investigated by researchers from a variety of educational and scientific backgrounds. Common to all of the areas of research inquiry is a focus on enhancing student, family, and community outcomes-particularly educational and social outcomes of all students-and in building the capacity of systems (schools, communities, and other systems) to support those outcomes with a commitment to incorporating social responsiveness in the research process. The aim of this definition is to embrace the breadth of scholarship informing and advancing the science, practice, and policy relevant to the field of school psychology.</ab>

        <ab>Vaccine hesitancy remains a barrier to successful COVID-19 vaccination programs across all populations. Attempts to mitigate this barrier, including mandates, have not been successful, especially in communities of color where the vaccination rates remain low. Nursing leadership, diversity, equity, and inclusion officers, and C-suite executives of 1 health system collaborated to address vaccine hesitancy through various community conversations with health care workers, non-direct caregivers, nursing students, and all populations across 4 state counties. The efforts of the health system were to improve trust in the health care system by presenting transparent dialogue with opportunities for interactive questions through presentations by health care professionals.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity in Institutional Review Board (IRB) membership is important for both intrinsic and instrumental reasons, including fairness, promoting trust, improving decision quality, and responding to systemic racism. Yet U.S. IRBs remain racially and ethnically homogeneous, even as gender diversity has improved. Little is known about IRB chairpersons' perspectives on membership diversity and barriers to increasing it, as well as current institutional efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within IRB membership.</ab>
        <ab>We surveyed IRB chairpersons leading U.S. boards registered with the Office for Human Research Protections. Here, we focus exclusively on responses from a subset of 388 chairpersons of IRBs at universities and academic medical centers (AMCs).</ab>
        <ab>Board chairs were predominantly white and evenly split between men and women. Only about half reported that their boards had at least one member who is Black or African American (51%), Asian (56%), or Hispanic (48%), with 85% of university/AMC boards comprised entirely (15%) or mostly (70%) of white members. Most IRB chairpersons (64%) reported satisfaction with the current diversity of their membership. Participants largely agreed that considering diversity in the selection of IRB members is important (91%), including to improve the quality of IRB deliberation (80%), with an emphasis on racial/ethnic (85%) and gender diversity (74%). Most participants (80%) reported some type of active DEI effort regarding board membership at their university/AMC and just over half (57%) expressed satisfaction with these efforts.</ab>
        <ab>Our national survey found that although university/AMC IRB chairpersons report valuing diversity in board membership, it may be lacking in key areas. Going forward, it will be important to specify clear reasons for diversity in the IRB context, as well to establish targets for acceptable levels of board diversity and to match DEI efforts to those targets.</ab>

        <ab>Most significant change (MSC) analysis is an evaluative method used to supplement outcome and impact program evaluations. MSC stories provide mini-narratives contextualizing the effect a program had on an individual. The Clinical Scholars program evaluation team used MSC to explore learner-centric leadership outcomes of the Clinical Scholars leadership training program.</ab>
        <ab>To identify thematic outcomes of trainees during the three years of their leadership training in the Clinical Scholars program.</ab>
        <ab>We identified three central thematic areas of most significant change: (1) leadership in practice, (2) self-awareness, and (3) equity, diversity, and inclusion. Other present themes included stakeholder engagement, effective leadership, collaboration, impact, expanded influence, innovation, networking, community engagement, evidence-based, implementation science, organizational development, hope, and advocating within organizations, teams, and the community. A total of 25 mid- and advanced-career level participants represented a diverse array of disciplines within the healthcare sector.</ab>
        <ab>MSC stories represented leaders' individual and team growth due to participating in the Clinical Scholars program. Results confirmed fidelity of program implementation to the original program goals, as outlined in the grant proposal. They highlighted three critical areas of development for this cohort of Fellows.</ab>

        <ab>Structural health inequities and racism adversely affect patient health and the culture of academic medicine. Formal training to educate fellows and faculty on antiracism is lacking.</ab>
        <ab>Our objective was to design, implement, and assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a year-long antiracism curriculum within a pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine division.</ab>
        <ab>This was a pre- and postintervention observational study conducted between July 2020 and June 2021. The curriculum was offered during an allotted educational meeting time slot at a single-center pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine division at a large academic institution to fellows and faculty. The curriculum consisted of 13 1-hour virtual interactive workshops delivered by local experts in diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. Surveys assessed knowledge on racism in medicine; opinions, understanding, and comfort surrounding race and racism in medicine; as well as additional questions to solicit feedback on the curriculum itself via visual analog scale and write-in comments.</ab>
        <ab>Before initiating the curriculum, 74% ( n  = 28) of respondents reported interest in an antiracism curriculum, and the majority (95%, n  = 36) believed that discrimination affects medical staff and patients. Respondents reported only moderate comfort in talking about race (median, 58; interquartile range 41-70 on visual analog scale 0-100, where 100 is strongly agree with "I feel comfortable talking about race"). The postintervention survey demonstrated stability of the belief of the presence of racial discrimination and a 15% increase in self-directed learning about related topics. Although knowledge related to the use of race in medical algorithms improved, 14% fewer participants reported interest in continuing to engage in a division-wide structured antiracism curriculum.</ab>

        <ab>There has been increased interest and attention to the need for equity, diversity, and inclusion, in the field of applied behavior analysis in recent years. Several publications have focused on these topics and educational curricula and professional development opportunities have been developed. One aspect that has received less attention is how companies providing behavior analytic services can help to promote and sustain a diverse workforce. The purpose of this article is to provide examples and recommendations for how these overarching goals can be addressed. The examples and recommendations are described in the context of a small company that has made important strides in addressing this topic through its mission to serve members of marginalized communities.</ab>

        <ab>Our synthetic review of the relevant and related literatures on the ethics and effects of using AI in education reveals five qualitatively distinct and interrelated divides associated with access, representation, algorithms, interpretations, and citizenship. We open our analysis by probing the ethical effects of algorithms and how teams of humans can plan for and mitigate bias when using AI tools and techniques to model and inform instructional decisions and predict learning outcomes. We then analyze the upstream divides that feed into and fuel the algorithmic divide, first investigating access (who does and does not have access to the hardware, software, and connectivity necessary to engage with AI-enhanced digital learning tools and platforms) and then representation (the factors making data either representative of the total population or over-representative of a subpopulation's preferences, thereby preventing objectivity and biasing understandings and outcomes). After that, we analyze the divides that are downstream of the algorithmic divide associated with interpretation (how learners, educators, and others understand the outputs of algorithms and use them to make decisions) and citizenship (how the other divides accumulate to impact interpretations of data by learners, educators, and others, in turn influencing behaviors and, over time, skills, culture, economic, health, and civic outcomes). At present, lacking ongoing reflection and action by learners, educators, educational leaders, designers, scholars, and policymakers, the five divides collectively create a vicious cycle and perpetuate structural biases in teaching and learning. However, increasing human responsibility and control over these divides can create a virtuous cycle that improves diversity, equity, and inclusion in education. We conclude the article by looking forward and discussing ways to increase educational opportunity and effectiveness for all by mitigating bias through a cycle of progressive improvement.</ab>

        <ab>Bias is commonplace in the health care environment and can negatively impact patients and their health outcomes. Simulation has long been shown to be an effective teaching tool for communication skills in health care, but it has rarely been used to deliver concrete behavioral skills that address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This scoping review examines 23 published articles surrounding the use of simulation in health care education to impart behavioral skills that reduce bias and promote DEI. Included articles described various behavioral skills including communication, history-taking, and system/community-level advocacy. The most commonly used simulation modality to teach these skills included the use of simulated participants (16 articles, 70%). The main DEI topics addressed in the trainings included sexual orientation/gender identity, language, and culture/ethnicity. Based on findings from this review, the authors suggest recommendations for educators who are considering teaching DEI-related skills through simulation.</ab>

        <ab>The need to improve gender equity (GE) in academic medicine is well documented. Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs), partnerships between leading National Health Service (NHS) organizations and universities in England, conduct world-class translational research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). In 2011, eligibility for BRC funding was restricted to universities demonstrating sustained GE success recognized by the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science Silver awards. Despite this structural change, GE research in BRC settings is underdeveloped, yet critical to the acceleration of women's advancement and leadership. To explore both women's and men's perceptions of GE and current markers of achievement in a BRC setting.</ab>
        <ab>Thematic analysis of data from two research projects: 53 GE survey respondents' free-text comments (34 women, 16 men), and 16 semi-structured interviews with women affiliated to the NIHR Oxford BRC.</ab>
        <ab>Four major themes emerged from the analysis: perceptions of the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science (GE policy); views on monitoring GE in BRCs; views on current markers of achievement in academia and GE; and recommendations for actions to improve GE in BRC settings. Monitoring of GE in BRCs was deemed to be important, but complex. Participants felt that current markers of achievement were not equitable to women, as they did not take contextual factors into account such as maternity leave and caring responsibilities. BRC-specific organizational policies and metrics are needed in order to monitor and catalyse GE.</ab>
        <ab>Markers of achievement for monitoring GE in BRCs should consider contextual factors specific to BRCs and women's career progression and professional advancement. GE markers of achievement should be complemented with broader aspects of equality, diversity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>In 2018, our Midwestern university medical center began offering unconscious bias training. Each session concluded with a standard evaluation. We analyzed two years of data that focused on three areas: 1) whether demographic differences or amount of prior knowledge on the topic influenced the training experience; 2) what participants liked best about the training; and 3) whether participants' stated intentions to apply their learning at the end of the training aligned with institutional goals of the training.</ab>
        <ab>Participants attended sessions open to the campus community pre-scheduled by the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and posted on its website. Chi-square tests were utilized to test associations between outcomes and questionnaire responses. Outcome measures included race/ethnicity, prior knowledge level, and overall rating of the training. Thematic analysis was used to code comments and establish themes from two open-ended survey questions.</ab>
        <ab>Significant differences were found by race and ethnicity for all questionnaire responses; each were p &lt; 0.001. Those who reported they had advanced/expert knowledge on the topic were less likely to report the training increased their knowledge, and those who reported their race as White/Caucasian tended to give the training the highest overall rating, as did heterosexuals. Through thematic analysis, participants valued the interactive nature of the training sessions, the use of storytelling, and the safety of the learning environment. Participants' intention to apply their learning indicated they had gained general awareness of bias and settings where it might influence their work.</ab>
        <ab>In an effort to foster a better working and learning environment for those who are underrepresented in the health professions, training was provide that may not have met the expectations of all participants. At the same time, participants who identified as White clearly increased their awareness of bias. Therefore, it is recommended to move away from one-size-fits-all unconscious bias training and develop a robust training continuum to provide ongoing advancement for diverse audiences.</ab>

        <ab>Lack of racial and ethnic diversity in health research negatively impacts generalizability. We describe Mexican and Mexican American women's willingness to participate in health research in Oregon.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a survey with Mexican-origin Latinas aged 18-49 years. Our primary outcome was willingness to participate in health research; we also asked sociodemographics and barriers and facilitators to participation. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with willingness to participate.</ab>
        <ab>Of 500 participants, 41% said that they would be willing to participate in health research, 14% said no, and 45% were unsure. In multivariable analyses, past participation in research and speaking English well were independently associated with willingness to participate. Barriers to participation included language, accessibility, and fear of medical procedures. Facilitators included improving future health care, language, and free medical care.</ab>
        <ab>Mexican-origin Latinas in Oregon are willing to participate in health research, but many are unsure. Providing study materials in Spanish is a concrete first step to improve recruitment and promote equity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this study was to review internal medicine residency program websites in the United States based on their published support for wellness, diversity, equity, and inclusion concepts. Inclusion of wellness, diversity, equity, and inclusion on program websites can serve as critical student benchmarks, and it may be paramount to optimize residency program websites accordingly.</ab>
        <ab>This is a cross-sectional study of the websites of 597 internal medicine residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education between March 25 and April 25, 2022. The websites were assessed based on 22 characteristics consisting of wellness verbiage, gender and underrepresented in medicine evaluation of faculty and residents, and diversity, equity, and inclusion-related semantics. Website photos were used to assess ethnic/sex representation. These attributes were devised by two sequentially set up focus groups consisting of 49 racially, ethnically, and gender-diverse medical students.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 579 internal medicine programs were reviewed. Only 239 (41%) had a dedicated page for resident wellness activities and efforts, while 134 (19%) had no mention of the concept throughout their web pages. Similarly, only 136 (23%) had a dedicated wellness officer, whether faculty or resident, who was focused on departmental interests. Gender diversity could be determined in 445 (77%) and 459 (79%) websites for faculty and residents, respectively. Underrepresented in medicine faculty and residents was noted in 293 (51%) and 393 (68%) of websites, respectively. A diversity, equity, and inclusion section was present in 172 (30%) of programs, with 93 (16%) having an assigned faculty or resident. Chairpersons or program directors stressed diversity, equity, and inclusion in up to 456 (79%) of the websites, with 181 (31%) having program mission statements or goals that include diversity, equity, and inclusion verbiage.</ab>
        <ab>A deficit of various essential wellness, diversity, equity, and inclusion attributes persists across internal medicine residency websites. Residency programs would benefit from optimizing their websites to attract more diverse applicants.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction  Matching into an orthopaedic surgery residency program presents a challenging accomplishment for applicants to achieve in any given year. Due to the profound changes to the application process caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic it was theorized that there would be a change in the number of graduates matching close to their home medical school region, state, and program. Methods  Orthopaedic surgery residency program Web sites and social media accounts were accessed to elucidate current resident data, including graduates' medical school, and geographical location of their school. Chi-square analysis was performed to identify trends in current residents matching within their home program, state, and region associated with the 2021 orthopaedic match. These numbers were compared with previous year's successful applicants. Results  In 2021, a significant 4.4% ( p =0.02) increase in successful matches within applicants' home states occurred (33.4% vs. 37.8%) and home programs ( p &lt;0.001) when compared with previous years (21.2% vs. 27.4%). However, in 2021, there was no significant change in home region matching ( p =0.56) with 60% of successful matches occurring in home regions. This was statistically consistent with what was observed in previous years (61.4%). Conclusion  The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with restrictions in travel and interview options resulting in a significant increase in the number of orthopaedic applicants who matched into their home program, or at programs in their home state compared with previous years. Although no statistically significant regional change occurred during the 2021 match, it remains the leading predictor of where successful applicants will match. With many unknowns related to the upcoming match cycles it is important for applicants and programs to have a general idea of recent trends and outcomes to best focus their efforts, especially if diversity and minority inclusion are considered in highly competitive specialties like orthopaedic surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Assessing the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate of emergency departments (EDs) can inform organizational change to provide equitable, inclusive, and high-quality care to their diverse patient populations. The purpose of this project was to investigate patient perspectives on the climate of DEI in an urban ED.</ab>
        <ab>This was a cross-sectional survey study conducted in a large-volume, urban ED in Detroit, MI, from November 2018 to January 2019. The survey was developed by an experienced ED DEI committee via an iterative process and broad consensus.</ab>
        <ab>During their care in the ED, 849 patients completed an anonymous survey about their perspectives and experiences of DEI in that ED. Overall, the responses were favorable as most respondents reported that the ED staff treated patients from all races equally (75.8%) and made patients feel accepted (86%). However, some respondents felt that the ED staff's treatment of populations with greater complexity, such as patients who are mentally ill (16.8%) or lower income (14.3%), needs the most improvement.</ab>
        <ab>This DEI climate assessment survey of ED patients' perspectives revealed important insights that could guide strategic initiatives to advance DEI in the ED. This assessment may serve as a model for continuous evaluation of DEI over time and in multiple healthcare settings to help guide organizational change efforts.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the general US population, many, if not most, medical schools fall short of matriculating students reflective of this change in diversity. The Latinx community constitutes nearly 20% of the US population and is expected to rise substantially in the coming decades. Over the past 20 years, the number of Latinx students applying to and being admitted to medical school has grown but remains below 4% of the total medical student body composition. Several factors contribute to the under-representation of Latinx students in medical schools that include access to secondary education, finances, lack of mentorship or advice, and a multitude of other structural inequities and system-level biases. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are often named as key pillars of workforce development across the US medical schools and academic institutions. Despite significant efforts, medical schools continue to have low Latinx representation within their student body, and recruitment efforts often lack sustainability. In this manuscript, we share our experience of increasing Latinx student representation within a top-ranked medical school in the US southeast region. We have discussed the barriers we faced in enrolling and attracting Latinx students' amidst similar under-representation of Latinx faculty, staff, and leadership and the challenges of financial support for applicants and financial aid packages for admitted students. The strategies we implemented to achieve an increased representation of Latinx students in the School of Medicine (SOM) included revitalizing the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA), ensuring Latinx student representation within the SOM admission committee that included Latinx faculty as active participants in recruitment and retention efforts, redesigning the medical Spanish course, and creating dedicated outreach plans during second look weekend for interested Latinx students and active outreach to applicants and accepted students by current students. In combination, these efforts led to a significant increase in Latinx representation in the SOM student body from 2.6% in 2009 to 12.2% in 2021. We will conclude by discussing our ongoing challenges and our approach to sustain and improve Latinx representation in our medical school.</ab>

        <ab>To assess the perceived state of diversity in Radiology Residency Programs in the United States and to evaluate the level of acceptance for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.</ab>
        <ab>An electronic survey was conducted of the Radiology Residency Programs in the United States in December 2021 and January 2022. Respondents were recruited by email sent to the members of the Association of University Radiologists who were Radiology Residency Program Directors. Quantitative and Qualitative analyses were performed.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 198 emails sent out to the Radiology Program Directors, 53 completed surveys were returned (response rate of 27%). Although some progress has been made in increasing the number of women and Asians in Academic Radiology, there is persisting imbalance of the numbers of African American and Latinx radiologists which comprise far less than 25% of the physician workforce. Nearly half of the respondents reported having a Vice Chair of DEI. Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis. Most respondents agreed that diversity should be considered when recruiting faculty and residents. Many noted a strong commitment to DEI but they felt there was room for improvement in formalizing efforts to aid in recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Diversity education was more likely mandatory for residents and optional for faculty.</ab>
        <ab>Academic Radiology programs are recognizing the value of internal DEI leadership roles. Radiologists are implementing DEI initiatives and making intentional changes in the recruitment of diverse radiologists. More concerted efforts are needed to increase the low numbers of African American and Latinx radiologists. Effective evaluation metrics for various DEI programs are needed to assess how successful these endeavors are in creating lasting changes.</ab>

        <ab>A crucial reckoning was initiated when the COVID-19 pandemic began to expose and intensify long-standing racial/ethnic health inequities, all while various sectors of society pursued racial justice reform. As a result, there has been a contextual shift towards broader recognition of systemic racism, and not race, as the shared foundational driver of both societal maladies. This confluence of issues is of particular relevance to Black populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic and racial injustice. In response, institutions have initiated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts as a way forward. This article considers how the dual pandemic climate of COVID-19-related health inequities and the racial justice movement could exacerbate the "time and effort tax" on Black faculty to engage in DEI efforts in academia and biomedicine. We discuss the impact of this "tax" on career advancement and well-being, and introduce an operational framework for considering the interconnected influence of systemic racism, the dual pandemics, and DEI work on the experience of Black faculty. If not meaningfully addressed, the "time and effort tax" could contribute to Black and other underrepresented minority faculty leaving academia and biomedicine - consequently, the very diversity, equity, and inclusion work meant to increase representation could decrease it.</ab>

In this comprehensive review, we synthesize evidence of greater increases in mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among socially or economically marginalized groups in the United States, including (a) people who are low income or experiencing homelessness, (b) racial and ethnic minorities, (c) women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) communities, (d) immigrants and migrants, (e) children and people with a history of childhood adversity, and (f) the socially isolated and lonely. Based on this evidence, we propose that reducing social and economic inequality would promote population mental health and societal resilience to future crises. Specifically, we propose concrete, actionable recommendations for policy, intervention, and practice that would bolster five "pillars" of societal resilience: (1) economic safety and equity, (2) accessible healthcare, including mental health services, (3) combating racial injustice and promoting respect for diversity, equity, and inclusion, (4) child and family protection services, and (5) social cohesion. Although the recent pandemic exposed and accentuated steep inequalities within our society, efforts to rebuild offer the opportunity to re-envision societal resilience and policy to reduce multiple forms of inequality for our collective benefit.</ab>

        <ab>The National Institute of General Medical Sciences Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) has been successful in producing clinician-scientists, with a majority of graduates pursuing research-related careers. However, there are a number of areas of continuing concern for the program. In particular, women and individuals from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds remain persistently underrepresented in MSTPs relative to the average college-aged U.S. population and to students receiving life sciences bachelor's degrees. The authors, who include leaders of NIGMS, identify a number of challenges and opportunities for enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the MSTPs and suggest strategies for addressing them.</ab>

        <ab>The objective of this project was to train future physicians to work effectively and thoughtfully with diverse populations by teaching them to employ Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) skills to increase cultural humility, with the goal of improving attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about working with diverse patients. We developed ACT for cultural humility online interactive modules as part of an elective course to teach Medical Spanish to 4th-year medical students. Pre- and post-pilot data pertaining to the cultural humility training modules on the Work-Related Acceptance and Action questionnaire, Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We also included descriptive data pertaining to overall satisfaction with the cultural humility modules and intent to apply the material learned to patient care. Our data showed a significant increase in the cultural humility of our participants as well as an increase in psychological flexibility, a higher favorability rating toward various ethnicities, improvements in attitude, and positive changes in beliefs and knowledge following completion of the modules. The modules were well received by the medical students, with high social validity ratings. The ACT for cultural humility curriculum has great potential to enhance medical education in diversity, equity, and inclusion by increasing both the understanding and the cultural humility of medical students and future professionals to work with diverse populations. The current paper provides a framework that can be used by other programs to shape the education of the future medical workforce to help promote culturally humble care.</ab>

        <ab>In July of 2020, AORN created a comprehensive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion plan that includes a patient-focused committee whose goal is to improve the care, experience, and outcomes of each patient by providing relevant information, education, and resources about diversity, equity, and inclusion to the perioperative team. To gain insight into racial disparities in the surgical setting, the committee conducted a literature search and identified relevant evidence. As in health care in general, disparities in surgical care and outcomes exist between patients of color and their white counterparts. The reasons are multifactorial and interconnected, with contributing factors related to the patient, health care providers, the health care system, and surgical and postoperative care. Disparities can occur at any point along the perioperative continuum. Research conducted during the past 10 years supports the existence of disparities in the surgical setting and across surgical specialties, but few researchers have recommended strategies that perioperative teams can implement for improvement. The white paper identifies disparities in the surgical setting, actions that facilities and perioperative teams can take to mitigate disparities, and information gaps that should be the focus of future research. Perioperative team members and health care organizations are ethically responsible to lead the development and implementation of changes in health care settings and in public and health policies that address disparities in surgical care and outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Although often assumed as objective, texts in nursing education are value-laden artifacts. Not unlike many educational materials, nursing texts are socially situated and often reflect dominant discourses of white supremacy, patriarchy, colonialism, cis/heteronormativity, gender binaries, and ableism. In addition to conveying what institutions and educators value, the discourses that are mediated through text socialize students in their ways of thinking and acting. There is a collective responsibility to critically examine how and why particular discourses persistently permeate texts used in nursing education. Open educational resources, as one type of text in nursing, are often touted as symbols of social justice because they are accessible for use by diverse learners and can be adapted to suit educators' needs.</ab>
        <ab>With a focus on better understanding how equity, diversity, and inclusion can inform the design and production of open education resources, our guiding research question was: How do students perceive and envision equity, diversity, and inclusion in nursing-related open educational resources?</ab>
        <ab>Guided by a social justice framework, we used interpretive description methodology informed by participatory action research values to answer this question.</ab>
        <ab>Sixteen students participated from a post-secondary year-one nursing course in two focus groups and thirty-three students completed an open-ended survey.</ab>
        <ab>Data analysis yielded four themes: representation, learning, identities, and self.</ab>
        <ab>Nurse educators have the opportunity to design open educational resources in ways that empower students and elevate social justice. Thus, a more nuanced and critical approach towards social justice is needed to better integrate diversity in nursing-related resources.</ab>

        <ab>In response to decades-long exclusionary practices, academic institutions are now recruiting early career researchers (ECRs) from systemically marginalized populations who specialize in equity-related research. As a result, these ECRs are likely to conduct research within their communities on topics that have personal relevance-insider research. Methodological training for insider research places an emphasis on methods, such as reflexivity, to ensure rigor; however, the emotional and psychological impacts of these research methods on the researcher are seldom discussed. Therefore, I use analytic autoethnography to illustrate the embodied impacts of conducting insider research using an example of personal relevance and argue that methodological practices require an embodied reflexivity that centers the researcher and the impacts the research has on them. This paradoxically rewarding and taxing work necessitates changes in methodological training and practice, institutional support, and an openness to innovation when calling for equity, diversity, and inclusion in the academy.</ab>

        <ab>LGBTQ+ populations constitute increasing proportions of children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, this group suffers from health inequities, including oral health. The report "Oral Health: Advances and Challenges" identified the LGBTQ+ community as an underserved population which faces significant barriers in accessing oral health care. Coverage of LGBTQ+ topics in formal education settings in both dental schools and dental hygiene programs is scarce, which contributes to inequities within this group. Increasing curriculum content related to LGBTQ+ populations is of utmost importance to promote optimal patient-provider interactions while improving oral health outcomes. Ensuring equity in oral health care provision will require deliberate, consistent efforts on the part of all stakeholders. Dental and allied dental education programs have made important strides in enhancing equity and inclusion in their institutions by engaging campus groups that support LGBTQ+ populations, creating mentorship programs, and collaborating with non-profit advocacy groups. Such efforts have successfully empowered LGBTQ+ patients, providers, and allies who are committed to further closing the knowledge gap. Most of the research regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts have been done in the medical arena and there is a void in the data available from the dental profession. To fill this void, recommendations are offered that institutions can easily implement to expand LGBTQ+ diversity and inclusion visibility.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to describe six nursing programs that exemplify a variety of ways that social mission goals are pursued in different contexts.</ab>
        <ab>Using a case study approach, we selected nursing schools that excelled in at least one of the following social mission domains: education program, community engagement, governance, diversity &amp; inclusion, institutional culture &amp; climate and research. We conducted video interviews with the administration, faculty and students.</ab>
        <ab>Main themes were: (1) central university/college commitment; (2) allocation of school resources; (3) faculty buy-in; (4) community partnerships; and, (5) an institutional culture of inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Educational Institutions in the U.S. have responded to government policies that called for more inclusive educational systems. The goal is to reduce the oppression created by "racism" and enhance the environmental trajectory toward equity and justice. Although significant social and economic advances have been made, these have not been sustainable, and disparities remain. As educational systems have not kept pace with the demographics and economic trends, there is a call to action to affirm the need to establish policies that support diversity within pipeline pathways, faculty recruitment, and retention. Leveraging knowledge and networking across institutions with communities can transform academic cultures, reduce unconscious/implicit bias, and microaggression. As racism exists in every segment of our culture, building sustainable capacity and a system proportional to the populations' relative needs can help chart a direction forward for policies that support justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion among dental institutions.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: One of the six guiding principles of the EMS Agenda 2050 is to foster a socially equitable care delivery system. A specific recommendation within this principle is that "local EMS leadership, educators and clinicians [should] reflect the diversity of their communities." Research has shown that women comprise a minority of emergency medicine services (EMS) field clinicians. In academic settings, women are represented at lower rates among experienced EMS faculty than within Emergency Medicine clinicians or faculty at large. The reasons for these differences are also unknown. Little data exist describing the number or experience of female physicians and professionals in EMS. Purpose: Our objective was to describe the composition and experiences of EMS physicians, researchers and professionals who participate in the Women in EMS group of the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP). Methods : We performed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods descriptive study of women belonging to the Women in EMS Committee of NAEMSP. A survey was sent to the 143 members of this group using a list-serve, and the data was collected in Redcap. Results: Seventy-four people completed the survey. Respondents were 96% female, 82% Caucasian, 11% underrepresented minorities (URM), and 7% LGBTQI. Of the 88% that are physicians, 78% are board certified in Emergency Medicine, compared to 55% in EMS. Forty-eight percent reported they received some form of mentorship. Among these respondents, a minority reported female mentorship, which was usually from a remote rather than local mentor (41% vs. 15%). Eighty-three percent of respondents had experienced some form of discrimination or harassment in their career, but only 68% reported their workplace culture discourages such behavior. Thirty-three percent of respondents report receiving unequal recognition because of gender. Thematic evaluation of the qualitative responses showed that respondents felt there were fewer barriers to mentorship and professional advancement opportunities in local work versus national engagement. Conclusions: In a survey evaluating representation of female professionals in EMS, participants reported on their career representations, and experiences of gender-based inequity within their EMS career settings. Several opportunities exist to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion for women in EMS based on our findings.</ab>

This position statement outlines the Anaesthesia Editors' current policies and practices aiming to achieve equity, represent the diversity of our specialty and actively include people engaged with this journal and beyond. We will define, promote and embed principles of equity, diversity and inclusion across all our work. We will monitor and report author and editor characteristics and ensure recruitment practices are transparent and adhere to our principles on equity, diversity and inclusion. We will attempt to remove systemic barriers restricting those from under-represented groups from progressing into leadership roles within anaesthesia. We will respond to threats and barriers to the principles and practices we set. With these principles and specific actions we undertake, we aim to be pro-active rather than reactive. We commit to embracing and embedding equity, diversity and inclusion in all our practices and regularly reviewing, improving and updating our policies and practices.</ab>

        <ab>The Region V Public Health Training Center (RVPHTC) serves the public health workforce in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. An important tool in priority-setting workforce development is the training needs assessment (TNA), which is vital to identifying and addressing the capacity-building needs of the public health workforce.</ab>
        <ab>In 2021, we conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with key partners in the local, state, and tribal health workforce.</ab>
        <ab>Findings reflect the results of 23 interviews administered from March to May 2021. Questions solicited in-depth input related to key training gaps identified in our 2020 quantitative TNA; the impact of COVID-19 on the public health workforce; general needs, including preferred training modalities; needs by audience type; and the current capacity for public health agencies to support student development.</ab>
        <ab>Key training needs of the public health workforce identified by the 2021 TNA include the strategic skills domains of (1) resource management; (2) change management; (3) justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion; and (4) effective communication. The first 3 domains were also noted as having the greatest training need in our 2020 quantitative TNA of local health department leadership.</ab>
        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for training in effective communication in new ways and the continued need for training support in the skill domains prioritized in the 2020 assessment. Findings demonstrate the need for capacity building around crosscutting skills and the intersection of strategic skill domains if the field is to be prepared for future threats to public health.</ab>

        <ab>High-stakes, standardized testing has historically impeded education/career attainment for members of underrepresented minority groups and people needing testing accommodations. This study was to understand how high-stakes, standardized testing, particularly the NCLEX-RN, impacts diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in nursing. This study explored the history, context, perspectives surrounding standardized testing, with a focus on the NCLEX-RN. The authors consider content, form, and delivery of testing, including accommodations. They identify available data and data collection gaps relevant to DEI and the NCLEX-RN. No nursing organization published the national data necessary to evaluate/refine the NCLEX-RN from a DEI perspective. Preliminary nursing studies and data from other professions indicated disparities in testing outcomes. Nursing must determine if prospective nurses are experiencing disparities in testing outcomes. The authors highlight opportunities to advance DEI through improved data collection, reformed licensure processes, and the reframing of standardized testing as one of many tools to determine competency.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the established value of diversity, equity, and inclusion as critical components to achieving academic excellence, building diversity within nursing education remains a challenge. Institutional gatekeeping, overt racism, and implicit biases are barriers that perpetuate a low percentage of nursing faculty of color. From pre-search strategic prioritization to submission of the search committee report, a multi-prong, just, transparent, systematic, and strategic approach to hiring is needed to advance opportunities for hiring a diverse faculty. This article provides nursing administration leaders, search committee members, and faculty engaged in hiring practices with a stepwise review of specific strategies. Evidence and tools to mitigate bias, attract excellent and diverse applicant pools, conduct fair evaluations, and support ongoing reflection and improvement of hiring practices are described. An overview of types of implicit bias in hiring practices, descriptive evaluation rubrics, and self-reflection questions are included.</ab>

        <ab>Community-engaged research (CEnR) is an approach to inquiry that centers scientist-community partnerships characterized by mutuality and reciprocity, and is well-aligned with trauma-informed principles, such as trustworthiness, transparency, and fostering empowerment.</ab>
        <ab>The current paper considers definitions and applications of CEnR, highlighting examples from the trauma literature, from the formulation of research questions to the dissemination of research findings.</ab>
        <ab>To realize CEnR's promise to contribute to innovation, scientific understanding, and increased impact in the trauma field will require a shift in training and institutions. Fortunately, a growing interest in advocacy, public psychology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion presents an opportunity for synergy. Practical guidance is offered for supporting CEnR by preparing students, investing in faculty, and building infrastructure. Clinical Impact Statement: Community-engaged research (CEnR) focuses on equitable scientist-community partnerships in research, and shares principles with trauma-informed work. By prioritizing community collaboration, CEnR has the potential to lead to innovation, scientific understanding, and increased impact in the trauma field. For example, CEnR approaches emphasize dissemination to public audiences, which could help educate the public and policymakers about trauma and its impact.

        <ab>To describe the literature on clinician-scientist training programs to inform the development of contemporary and inclusive training models.</ab>
        <ab>The authors conducted a scoping review, searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase databases from database inception until May 25, 2020. Studies presenting primary research that described and evaluated clinician-scientist training programs were identified for data abstraction. On the basis of deductive and inductive methods, information about program characteristics, curricula, teaching strategies, and success metrics was extracted. The extracted variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</ab>
        <ab>From the initial 7,544 citations retrieved and 4,974 unique abstracts screened, 81 studies were included. Of the 81 included studies, 65 (80.2%) were published between 2011 and 2020, 54 (66.7%) were conducted in the United States, and 64 (79.0%) described programs that provided broad clinician-scientist training. Few programs provided funding or protected research time or specifically addressed needs of trainees from underrepresented minority groups. Curricula emphasized research methods and knowledge dissemination, whereas patient-oriented research competencies were not described. Most programs incorporated aspects of mentorship and used multiple teaching strategies, such as direct and interactive instruction. Extrinsic metrics of success (e.g., research output) were dominant in reported program outcomes compared with markers of intrinsic success (e.g., career fulfillment).</ab>
        <ab>Although programs are providing clinician-scientists with practical skills training, opportunities exist for curricular and pedagogic optimization that may better support this complex career path. Training programs for clinician-scientists can address contemporary issues of wellness and equity by reconsidering metrics of program success and evolving the core tenets of their education models to include equity, diversity, and inclusion principles and patient-oriented research competencies.</ab>

        <ab>The International Liver Transplantation Society (ILTS) has placed a strong focus on achieving gender equality and equity in liver transplant (LT). We aimed to understand gender distribution in leadership positions among LT physicians around the world and within ILTS.</ab>
        <ab>In 2019, the ILTS Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee distributed a survey to obtain granular data on gender and characteristics of transplant physicians as well as those in leadership positions in each center. Additionally, data were collected on the gender composition of the ILTS membership, council, chairpersons, and committees and from the United Network for Organ Sharing.</ab>
        <ab>Data were collected from 243 transplant centers. Thirty-two (13.2%) had at least 1 woman as the director of LT, chief of transplant surgery, or chief of transplant hepatology. Of the 243 centers, 133 reported the age and gender of the leadership personnel. Women physicians comprised 152 of the 833 transplant surgeons (18.2%) and 298 of the 935 hepatologists (31.9%). Among the 1331 ILTS physician members, 588 (44.2%) provided gender information in their member profiles, and 155 (26.3%) identified themselves as women. Of the 26 ILTS leadership positions, 7 (26.9%) were held by women.</ab>
        <ab>This analysis of worldwide gender distribution in the LT physician workforce showed notable gender disparity in LT leadership around the globe and within the ILTS. These data provide a launching point for promoting and achieving gender equality and equity in LT.</ab>

        <ab>The Current Insights feature is designed to introduce life science educators and researchers to current articles of interest in other social science and education journals. In this installment, I highlight three recent studies from the fields of psychology and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education that can inform life science education. The first assesses the impact of a novel study strategy: having students deliberately make mistakes and correct them. The second encourages educators to think more carefully about the impact of different types of interest on student learning. The third reminds us of the impact of personal beliefs in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.</ab>

        <ab>Medical education refers to education and training delivered to medical students in order to become a practitioner. In recent decades, medicine has been radically transformed by scientific and computational/digital advances-including the introduction of new information and communication technologies, the discovery of DNA, and the birth of genomics and post-genomics super-specialties (transcriptomics, proteomics, interactomics, and metabolomics/metabonomics, among others)-which contribute to the generation of an unprecedented amount of data, so-called 'big data'. While these are well-studied in fields such as medical research and methodology, translational medicine, and clinical practice, they remain overlooked and understudied in the field of medical education. For this purpose, we carried out an integrative review of the literature. Twenty-nine studies were retrieved and synthesized in the present review. Included studies were published between 2012 and 2021. Eleven studies were performed in North America: specifically, nine were conducted in the USA and two studies in Canada. Six studies were carried out in Europe: two in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, and one in several European countries. One additional study was conducted in China. Eight papers were commentaries/theoretical or perspective articles, while five were designed as a case study. Five investigations exploited large databases and datasets, while five additional studies were surveys. Two papers employed visual data analytical/data mining techniques. Finally, other two papers were technical papers, describing the development of software, computational tools and/or learning environments/platforms, while two additional studies were literature reviews (one of which being systematic and bibliometric).The following nine sub-topics could be identified: (I) knowledge and awareness of big data among medical students; (II) difficulties and challenges in integrating and implementing big data teaching into the medical syllabus; (III) exploiting big data to review, improve and enhance medical school curriculum; (IV) exploiting big data to monitor the effectiveness of web-based learning environments among medical students; (V) exploiting big data to capture the determinants and signatures of successful academic performance and counteract/prevent drop-out; (VI) exploiting big data to promote equity, inclusion, and diversity; (VII) exploiting big data to enhance integrity and ethics, avoiding plagiarism and duplication rate; (VIII) empowering medical students, improving and enhancing medical practice; and, (IX) exploiting big data in continuous medical education and learning. These sub-themes were subsequently grouped in the following four major themes/topics: namely, (I) big data and medical curricula; (II) big data and medical academic performance; (III) big data and societal/bioethical issues in biomedical education; and (IV) big data and medical career. Despite the increasing importance of big data in biomedicine, current medical curricula and syllabuses appear inadequate to prepare future medical professionals and practitioners that can leverage on big data in their daily clinical practice. Challenges in integrating, incorporating, and implementing big data teaching into medical school need to be overcome to facilitate the training of the next generation of medical professionals. Finally, in the present integrative review, state-of-art and future potential uses of big data in the field of biomedical discussion are envisaged, with a focus on the still ongoing "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been acting as a catalyst for innovation and digitalization.</ab>

        <ab>The Research Centers in Minority Institutions, (RCMI) Program was established by Congress to address the health research and training needs of minority populations, by preparing future generations of scientists at these institutions, with a track record of producing minority scholars in medicine, science, and technology. The RCMI Consortium consists of the RCMI Specialized Centers and a Coordinating Center (CC). The RCMI-CC leverages the scientific expertise, technologies, and innovations of RCMI Centers to accelerate the delivery of solutions to address health disparities in communities that are most impacted. There is increasing recognition that the gap in representation of racial/ethnic groups and women is perpetuated by institutional cultures lacking inclusion and equity. The objective of this work is to provide a framework for inclusive excellence by developing a systematic evaluation process with common data elements that can track the inter-linked goals of workforce diversity and health equity. At its core, the RCMI Program embodies the trinity of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We propose a realist evaluation framework and a logic model that integrates the institutional context to develop common data metrics for inclusive excellence. The RCMI-CC will collaborate with NIH-funded institutions and research consortia to disseminate and scale this model.</ab>

        <ab>Success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates sexist and racist "rewards" by prioritizing citations and impact factors. These metrics are flawed and biased against already marginalized groups and fail to accurately capture the breadth of individuals' meaningful scientific impacts. We advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We outline pathways for a paradigm shift in scientific values based on multidimensional mentorship and promoting mentee well-being. These actions will require collective efforts supported by academic leaders and administrators to drive essential systemic change.</ab>

        <ab>Hispanic and Latino (HL) cancer survivors are at a critical disadvantage compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients regarding sociodemographic adversities and access to equitable treatment options. By 2030, there will be about four million HL cancer survivors in the U.S., representing nearly 20% of survivors in this country. Hispanics and Latinos are subjected to significant challenges in accessing and receiving equitable care relative to NHWs. Hispanics and Latinos also experience lower rates of health insurance and financial resources, limiting health care options. These disparities often originate from disparate social determinants of health, including lower funding for education and school programs, greater neighborhood stressors and violence, lower access to healthy and affordable food, and greater barriers to community health and exercise opportunities. Even among HL cancer survivors with proper access to health care, they experience disparate treatment options, including low inclusion in clinical trials and/or access to experimental therapies. A solution to these barriers necessitates complex and systemic changes that involve, for example, investing in public health programs, increasing the diversity and cultural awareness of the medical workforce, and promoting research opportunities such as clinical trials that are inclusive of HLs. Only through meaningful reform will equitable cancer care be available for all in the U.S. regardless of racial and/or ethnic background. This article reviews some of the critical social determinants of health and biases relevant to HL cancer survivors and provides recommendations for achieving cancer health equity. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hispanics and Latinos experience a significant and often disproportionate cancer-related burden compared with non-Hispanic and Latino White individuals and other racial and ethnic groups. Meaningful reform to achieve health equity in oncology should focus on approaches to gaining trust among diverse patients, cultural and community sensitivity and engagement in oncology care and research, diversifying the workforce, and improving inclusion in clinical trial participation. Taken together, these recommendations can lead to exemplary and equitable care for all patients.</ab>

        <ab>The communities of Banff, Canmore, Lake Louise, and Kananaskis are home to some of Alberta's most popular tourist attractions. In recent years, the area has seen a significant increase in foreign-born residents. The Bow Valley Immigration Partnership (BVIP) brings together immigrants and stakeholders from multiple sectors to identify and implement strategies to promote integration.</ab>
        <ab>In collaboration with community service agencies and local employers, we developed the Bow Valley Workplace Inclusion Charter (WIC), a set of voluntarily adopted policies designed to increase inclusive practices in the workplace and promote integration of newcomers into the community. We then recruited and supported several employers in the area to make and implement specific commitments related to improving social determinants of health such as working conditions, social inclusion, education, and social support networks for immigrant workers.</ab>
        <ab>Eight Bow Valley employers, providing work for 38% of workers in the area, were enrolled in the pilot program. Mid-course evaluation identified facilitators and barriers to implementation of the WIC. At the conclusion of the pilot period, we evaluated the commitments implemented by each signatory to the WIC. Six of 8 employers fulfilled at least 5 commitments as articulated in the WIC, and 4 employers fulfilled 10 or more commitments.</ab>
        <ab>The WIC is a novel way of partnering with employers, community service agencies and immigrant workers to create inclusive workplace practices and improve integration of immigrants into the community. The WIC also has the potential to be adapted to address the needs of other equity-seeking groups who bring diversity to the workplace.</ab>

        <ab>Pediatric residency programs must adapt their curriculum to meet evolving patient needs yet face limited resources to implement changes resulting in gaps. We performed a categorical pediatric residency program curriculum needs assessment to inform curriculum development efforts. We analyzed data from the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics Annual Survey of Graduating Residents and pediatric program and associate program director polls conducted at a 2019 pediatric residency program director national meeting. We used conventional content analysis to code and categorize. Participants included 528 (53%) graduating residents representing 88% of programs, 89 program directors, and 177 associate program directors representing at minimum 45% of programs. Participants demonstrated concordance on the top 4 needs—additional clinical experiences, career development, business of medicine, and health systems. Program leaders also identified wellness and resiliency; disparities; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and communication. This is the first categorical pediatric program general curriculum needs assessment conducted of pediatric leadership and graduating residents in over a decade. While program leadership and resident data were collected 2 years apart, we found concordance on the top 4 categories and consistency with prior national needs assessments with the exception of career development. New curriculum development efforts are underway.</ab>

        <ab>Pediatric residency programs must adapt their curriculum to meet evolving patient needs yet face limited resources to implement changes resulting in gaps. We performed a categorical pediatric residency program curriculum needs assessment to inform curriculum development efforts.</ab>
        <ab>We analyzed data from the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics Annual Survey of Graduating Residents and pediatric program and associate program director polls conducted at a 2019 pediatric residency program director national meeting. We used conventional content analysis to code and categorize.</ab>
        <ab>Participants included 528 (53%) graduating residents representing 88% of programs, 89 program directors, and 177 associate program directors representing at minimum 45% of programs. Participants demonstrated concordance on the top 4 needs-additional clinical experiences, career development, business of medicine, and health systems. Program leaders also identified wellness and resiliency; disparities; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and communication.</ab>
        <ab>This is the first categorical pediatric program general curriculum needs assessment conducted of pediatric leadership and graduating residents in over a decade. While program leadership and resident data were collected 2 years apart, we found concordance on the top 4 categories and consistency with prior national needs assessments with the exception of career development. New curriculum development efforts are underway.</ab>

        <ab>The Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) recently issued a call for submissions that recognize and address social injustices; speak to diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workforce and among our user populations; and share critical perspectives on health sciences librarianship as well as those on any topic within JMLA 's scope written by authors who are Black, Indigenous, or People of Color. We also committed to creating more equitable opportunities for authors, reviewers, and editorial board members from marginalized groups. As part of this effort, we conducted a demographic survey of all individuals who served as a member of the JMLA editorial board or reviewer or had submitted a manuscript to JMLA between 2018 and 2020. We found that most survey respondents are white, heterosexual, women and do not identify with a disability, meaning that JMLA is missing out on a diversity of perspectives and life experiences that could improve the journal's processes and policies, enrich its content, and accelerate the research and practice of health sciences librarianship. Therefore, to avoid perpetuating or aggravating systemic biases and power structures in scholarly publishing or health sciences librarianship, we pledge to take concrete steps toward making JMLA a more diverse and inclusive journal.</ab>

        <ab>The terms diversity, equity, and inclusion have become part of a national conversation as we come to grips with longstanding societal negligence. But what do these terms mean with respect to health care, and are we manifesting them in our medical practices?</ab>
        <ab>Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index and Google, we mapped the locations of physical therapy and primary care clinics within the 4 most diverse Wisconsin counties-Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha, and Dane-which also had high Social Vulnerability Indexes, to assess health equity in these communities.</ab>
        <ab>Most physical therapy practices are located outside of vulnerable communities. While primary care is much more proficient at having a presence in these neighborhoods, there are still absences in some areas.</ab>
        <ab>Our analysis suggests that physical therapy services in Wisconsin are often inaccessible to members of vulnerable communities: a matter of equity. Efforts to improve equity via patient access must entail interventions that address the other components of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We recommend that other health care professionals conduct similar analyses in order to determine whether we, as a health care community, are positioning ourselves to best service our patients.</ab>

        <ab>This study reviews ancestral differences in the genetics of the LPA gene, risk categories of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as defined by guidelines, ancestry-specific Lp(a) risk, absolute and proportional risk, predictive value of risk thresholds among different ancestries, and differences between laboratory vs clinical accuracy in Lp(a) assays. For clinical decision-making, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the predictive value of Lp(a) does not vary sufficiently to mandate the use of ancestry-specific risk thresholds. This paper interprets the literature on Lp(a) and ancestral risk to support: 1) clinicians on understanding cardiovascular disease risk in different ancestral groups; 2) trialists for the design of clinical trials to ensure adequate ancestral diversity to support broad conclusions of drug effects; 3) regulators in the evaluation of the design and interpretation of results of Lp(a)-lowering trials with different Lp(a) inclusion thresholds; and 4) clinical laboratories to measure Lp(a) by assays that discriminate risk thresholds appropriately.</ab>

        <ab>Adequate equitable recruitment of underrepresented groups in clinical research and trials is a national problem and remains a daunting challenge to translating research discoveries into effective healthcare practices. Engagement, recruitment, and retention (ER&amp;R) training programs for Clinical Research Professionals (CRPs) often focus on policies and regulations. Although some training on the importance of diversity and inclusion in clinical research participation has recently been developed, there remains a need for training that couples critical equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) concepts with skill development in effective recruitment and retention strategies, regulations, and best practices.</ab>
        <ab>We developed the ER&amp;R Certificate program as a holistic approach to provide Duke University CRPs the opportunity to build competency in gap areas and to increase comfort in championing equitable partnerships with clinical research participants. The thirteen core and elective courses include blended learning elements, such as e-learning and wiki journaling prompts, to facilitate meaningful discussions. Pre- and post-assessments administered to CRP program participants and their managers assessed program impact on CRP skills in ER&amp;R tasks and comfort in equitable, diverse, and inclusive engagement of clinical research participants.</ab>
        <ab>Results from the first two cohorts indicate that CRPs perceived growth in their own comfort with program learning objectives, especially those centered on participant partnership and EDI principles, and most managers witnessed growth in competence and responsibility for ER&amp;R-related tasks. Results suggest value in offering CRPs robust training programs that integrate EDI and ER&amp;R training.</ab>

        <ab>In an attempt to redesign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments to be more inclusive of all student populations, institutions of higher learning are reviewing their programs, policies, and the ways they engage students. The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) has been working with STEM departments over the past 10 years to improve the student experience by incorporating evidence-based teaching practices and creating curricula with a deeper focus on conceptual understanding of scientific principles, competencies, and the process of science. PULSE created the PULSE rubrics, a set of five rubrics designed to assist life sciences departments in assessing their implementation of the recommendations of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Vision and Change report in the areas of curriculum, assessment, faculty practice and faculty support, infrastructure, and climate for change. An additional rubric, on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), is described in this paper. Each of the 13 criteria of the PULSE DEI rubric begins with a context section of background information with references and a scale of 0 to 4 (baseline to exemplar) with descriptors for each score. The PULSE DEI rubric has been added to allow departments to determine the starting point for their DEI work and reveal areas that require attention. All PULSE rubrics can be accessed from the PULSE Community website (https://www.pulse-community.org/rubrics).</ab>

        <ab>Enhancing diversity in the scientific workforce is a long-standing issue. This study uses mixed methods to understand the feasibility, impact, and priority of six key strategies to promote diverse and inclusive training and contextualize the six key strategies across Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) Program Institutions.</ab>
        <ab>Four breakout sessions were held at the NCATS 2020 CTSA Program annual meeting focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. This paper focuses on the breakout session for Enhancing DEI in Translational Science Training Programs. Data were analyzed using a mixed methods convergent approach. The quantitative strand includes the online polling results. The qualitative strand includes the breakout session and the chat box in response to the training presentation.</ab>
        <ab>Across feasibility, impact, and priority questions, prioritizing representation ranked number 1. Building partnerships ranked number 2 in feasibility and priority, while making it personal ranked number 2 for impact. Across each strategy, rankings supported the qualitative data findings in feasibility through shared experiences, impact in the ability to increase DEI, and priority rankings in comparison to the other strategies. No divergence was found across quantitative and qualitative data findings.</ab>
        <ab>Findings provide robust support for prioritizing representation as a number one strategy to focus on in training programs. Specifically, this strategy can be operationalized through integration of community representation, diversity advocates, and adopting a holistic approach to recruiting a diverse cadre of scholars into translational science training programs at the national level across CTSAs.</ab>

        <ab>A future in which scientific discoveries are valued and trusted by the general public cannot be achieved without greater inclusion and participation of diverse communities. To envision a path towards this future, in January 2019 a diverse group of researchers, educators, students, and administrators gathered to hear and share personal perspectives on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the plant sciences. From these broad perspectives, the group developed strategies and identified tactics to facilitate and support EDI within and beyond the plant science community. The workshop leveraged scenario planning and the richness of its participants to develop recommendations aimed at promoting systemic change at the institutional level through the actions of scientific societies, universities, and individuals and through new funding models to support research and training. While these initiatives were formulated specifically for the plant science community, they can also serve as a model to advance EDI in other disciplines. The proposed actions are thematically broad, integrating into discovery, applied and translational science, requiring and embracing multidisciplinarity, and giving voice to previously unheard perspectives. We offer a vision of barrier-free access to participation in science, and a plant science community that reflects the diversity of our rapidly changing nation, and supports and invests in the training and well-being of all its members. The relevance and robustness of our recommendations has been tested by dramatic and global events since the workshop. The time to act upon them is now.</ab>

        <ab>There is growing acknowledgement of the legacy of White supremacy and racism in the discipline of epidemiology. Our department in the University of Washington School of Public Health undertook a systematic effort to begin addressing institutionalized racism and inclusive teaching in our courses. In July 2020, we introduced a new tool (the "Course Development Plan" (CDP)) to advance our curriculum. The CDP includes 2 components: 1) a guideline document that provides strategies on how to modify curricula and classroom teaching to incorporate antiracism and principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI); and 2) a structured worksheet for instructors to share EDI and antiracism practices they already incorporate and practices they plan to incorporate into their classes. Worksheets for each class are submitted prior to the beginning of the quarter and are reviewed by a peer faculty member and at least 1 epidemiology student; reviewers provide written feedback on the CDP worksheet. Further evaluation to assess the impact of the CDP process on classroom climate is ongoing. In this commentary, we discuss our department's efforts, the challenges we faced, and our hopes for next steps.</ab>

        <ab>Despite widespread interest in creating a more equitable and inclusive culture, a lack of workforce diversity persists in Radiology, in part due to a lack of universal and longitudinal metrics across institutions. In an attempt to establish benchmarks, a subset of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee volunteered to design a DEI dashboard as a potential tool for academic radiology programs to use to document and track their progress. This freely-available, modular dashboard includes suggested (plus optional department-defined) DEI activities/parameters and suggested assessment criteria across three domains: faculty, residents &amp; fellows, and medical students; it can be completed, in whole or in part, by departmental leaders annually. The suggested metrics and their associated rubrics were derived from the collective experiences of the five working group members, all of whom are chairs of academic radiology departments. The resulting dashboard was unanimously approved by the remaining 14 DEI committee members and endorsed by the SCARD board of directors.</ab>

        <ab>Achievement of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is an ongoing discussion that has evolved over time in the field of orthopaedic surgery. To enhance and highlight commitments to diversity, many academic department and health organizations have designated individuals to serve as their DEI leader. However, suboptimal structure and support of this specific leadership position have limited its potential and have led to increased position turnover and stagnation in progress. To mitigate these challenges, the Orthopaedic Diversity Leadership Consortium (ODLC) was formed as a growing network of orthopaedic diversity leaders from around the United States as well as international members and industry affiliates. The mission of ODLC is to optimize the sustainability of DEI efforts by providing professional development support and best-practice solutions to leaders serving in this capacity. The efforts of the organization are guided by 3 key objectives: leadership development, design of strategic plan models for diversity, and interprofessional education for perioperative care teams on inclusion. Through this powerful network and its educational offerings, ODLC works to increase role efficacy and to encourage sustainable creation of diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments for our patients, colleagues, and team members.</ab>

        <ab>Equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are fundamental principles. Little is known about the pattern of practice and perceptions of EDI among liver transplant (LT) providers. International Liver Transplant Society (ILTS) EDI Committee survey around topics related to discrimination, mentorship, and gender. Answers were collected and analyzed anonymously. Worldwide female leadership was also queried via publicly available data. The survey was e-mailed to 1312 ILTS members, 199 responses (40.7% female) were collected from 38 countries (15.2% response rate). Almost half were surgeons (45.7%), 27.6% hepatologists and 26.6% anesthetists. Among 856 LT programs worldwide, 8.2% of leadership positions were held by females, and 22% of division chiefs were female across all specialties. Sixty-eight of respondents (34.7%) reported some form of discrimination during training or at their current position, presumably related to gender/sexual orientation (20.6%), race/country of origin (25.2%) and others (7.1%). Less than half (43.7%) received mentorship when discrimination occurred. An association between female responses and discrimination, differences in compensation, and job promotion was observed. This survey reveals alarmingly high rate of experience with racial and gender disparity, lack of mentorship, and very low rates of female leadership in the LT field and calls to action to equity and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in clinical and translational science (CTS) are paramount to driving innovation and increasing health equity. One important area for improving diversity is among trainees in CTS programs. This paper reports on findings from a special session at the November 2020 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) national program meeting that focused on advancing diversity and inclusion within CTS training programs.</ab>
        <ab>Using qualitative content analysis, we identified approaches brought forth to increase DEI in KL2 career development and other training programs aimed at early-stage CTS investigators, beyond the six strategies put forth to guide the breakout session (prioritizing representation, building partnerships, making it personal, designing program structure, improving through feedback, and winning endorsement). We used an inductive qualitative content analysis approach to identify themes from a transcript of the panel of KL2 program leaders centered on DEI in training programs.</ab>
        <ab>We identified four themes for advancing DEI within CTS training programs: 1) institutional buy-in; 2) proactive recruitment efforts; 3) an equitable application process; and 4) high-quality, diverse mentorship.</ab>
        <ab>Implementing these strategies in CTS and other training programs will be an important step for advancing DEI. However, processes need to be established to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies through continuous quality improvement, a key component of the CTSA program. Training programs within the CTSA are well-positioned to be leaders in this critical effort to increase the diversity of the scientific workforce.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing health inequities in vulnerable and marginalized patient populations. Continuing professional development (CPD) can be a critical driver of change to improve quality of care, health inequities, and system change. In order for CPD to address these disparities in care for patient populations most affected in the health care system, CPD programs must first address issues of equity and inclusion in their education development and delivery. Despite the need for equitable and inclusive CPD programs, there remains a paucity of tools and frameworks available in the literature to guide CPD and broader education providers on how best to develop and deliver equitable and inclusive education programs. In this article, we describe the development and application of a Health Equity and Inclusion (HEI) Framework for education and training grounded in the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate model for instructional design. Using a case example, specifically a hospital-wide trauma-informed de-escalation for safety program, we demonstrate how the HEI Framework can be applied practically to CPD programs to support equity and inclusion in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation phases of education program delivery. The case example illustrates how the HEI Framework can be used by CPD providers to respect learner diversity, improve accessibility for all learners, foster inclusion, and address biases and stereotypes. We suggest that the HEI Framework can serve as an educational resource for CPD providers and health professions educators aiming to create equitable and inclusive CPD programs.</ab>

        <ab>People with disabilities experience concerning rates of ableism and are significantly under-represented within healthcare education and professions. Focusing on healthcare professions is important for enhancing the diversity and inclusion of equity-deserving groups within the workforce. The objective of this review was to explore the experiences and impact of workplace discrimination and ableism among healthcare providers and trainees with disabilities.</ab>
        <ab>Systematic searches of seven databases from 2000 to January 2022 were conducted. Five reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted the data and rated the study quality.</ab>
        <ab>48 studies met our inclusion criteria, representing 13,815 participants across six countries over a 21-year period. The findings highlighted rates and types of workplace ableism, which occurred at the institutional (i.e., inaccessible environments, physical barriers and unsupportive work environments) and individual level (i.e., negative attitudes, bullying, harassment). The impact of ableism on healthcare providers included difficulty disclosing due to fear of stigma, and effects on well-being and career development.</ab>
        <ab>Our findings revealed a critical need for more research on the experiences of ableism amongst healthcare providers and the impact it has on their well-being. Further efforts should explore mechanisms for including and welcoming people with disabilities in healthcare professions.Implications for rehabilitationWorkplace ableism is prevalent in health care professions and could be discouraging people with disabilities from entering or completing health care education and training, leading to an under-representation of this equity-deserving group within health care.More efforts are needed to recruit, retain and support people with disabilities in the health care workforce.Health care providers who have a disability often experience workplace discrimination and inaccessible physical environments which can impact their health and well-being.Managers, senior leadership and health care organizations should advocate for improved social inclusion of employees with disabilities.</ab>

        <ab>This commentary discusses improving research advocacy as part of National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trial activities in scientific steering committees and task forces between 2016 and 2020. Before 2016, the focus of patient advocate input on clinical trial concept evaluation was assessing accrual feasibility. By leveraging informal benchmarking and an outside-in perspective, the NCI patient advocate steering committee, comprised of NCI scientific steering committee and task force advocates, has recalibrated research advocacy within and across its clinical trial concepts. Additionally, by focusing on research advocacy fundamentals, the NCI patient advocate steering committee clarified the scope of the research advocate roles, focused its mission, defined and developed competencies, measured engagement, and created collateral and processes that support better interactions and greater value generation. Continuous improvement in the collateral and the underlying approaches, along with calibrating their application and monitoring results, will be necessary to keep pace with the science and further enhance the value of cancer clinical trial research advocacy. The road ahead should build on these fundamentals and include increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical trial and research advocacy participants and the supporting infrastructure.</ab>

        <ab>Addressing issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become central in implementing inclusive and socially responsible rehabilitation education and clinical practice. Yet, the constructs of disability and d/Deaf identity and culture, as well as ableism and allyship are often overlooked. Or, these concepts are approached using outdated philosophical perspectives that pathologize disability and fail to prioritize the lived experiences, expertise, intersectionality, and self-identified needs of people with disabilities. A Critical Disability Studies (CDS) framework may provide a background for better understanding and responding to these issues through allyship.</ab>
        <ab>This study employed a CDS framework to understand the lived experiences of ableism and allyship from faculty, staff, and students on University of Washington (UW) campuses who identify as d/Deaf, disabled/with a disability, or as having a chronic health condition.</ab>
        <ab>During 2020-2021, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 22 diverse undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff with disabilities, one third who also identified as people of color. Encounters were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using constant comparison until themes emerged.</ab>
        <ab>Four major themes that emerged from the data are: (1) Ever-present ableism in healthcare, (2) Ableism at the intersections, (3) COVID: Surfacing ableism and expanding access, and (4) Disability allyship and healthcare partnership building. Experiences of ableism and allyship were identified at individual, group/unit, and institutional/systemic levels, though participants reported significantly fewer instances of allyship compared to experiences of ableism. Participants identified intersections between disability and other marginalized identities and juxtaposed the benefits of widespread adoption of many access-increasing practices and technologies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also highlighting ways in which the pandemic created new obstacles to inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>This analysis provides insights into ways of implementing inclusive practices in rehabilitation education, practice, and beyond. Rehabilitation students, faculty, and staff may not be aware of how ableism affects their disabled peers or underpins their professional education. It is important to cultivate opportunities within professional education and clinical training to explicitly address our collective role in creating inclusive and accessible academic and healthcare experiences for our diverse community post COVID-19. Drawing on a CDS framework, the research team devised the mnemonic TRAC, which includes Training, Recognition and Representation, Attendance and Action, and Calling to account as strategic guidelines for operationalizing such opportunities.</ab>
        <ab>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</ab>

        <ab>In this review, I describe our scientific journey to unearth the impact of RNA metabolism in cancer using the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E as an exemplar. This model allowed us to discover new structural, biochemical, and molecular features of RNA processing, and to reveal their substantial impact on cell physiology. This led us to develop proof-of-principle strategies to target these pathways in cancer patients leading to clinical benefit. I discuss the important role that the unexpected plays in research and the necessity of embracing the data even when it clashes with dogma. I also touch on the importance of equity, diversity, and inclusion to the success of the scientific enterprise.</ab>

        <ab>As the surgical community continues to work towards greater diversity, equity, and inclusion, the need for buy-in from all surgeons-including those of the White majority-becomes increasingly apparent. This article invites all surgeons to aid in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts as "allies," "upstanders," and "champions for change," and provides 2 specific frameworks for enacting allyship within the surgical field. Overt and conscious efforts to embrace allyship are imperative as we seek to fulfill our professional responsibilities to patients and will help create a workplace environment where all persons feel accepted, valued, welcomed, and respected.</ab>

        <ab>Systemic racism and inequity are embedded in higher education, especially in nursing. By disregarding health disparities and inequities, a hidden curriculum is endorsed, implicitly letting both instructors and students know that not addressing these subjects is acceptable.</ab>
        <ab>Needs assessments were performed to assess faculty and student attitudes about the needs for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) concepts. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, the School of Nursing leadership, faculty, and students created taskforces to implement anti-oppression curricula throughout prelicensure courses.</ab>
        <ab>Anti-oppression curricula and workshops were piloted successfully in the first semester of prelicensure nursing. Student feedback was positive with constructive suggestions. JEDI curriculum mapping was completed across the prelicensure nursing curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>JEDI concepts must be integrated across nursing curricula to identify gaps. Forming a collaboration between leadership, faculty, and students is an optimal way to proceed as they all are invested and accountable for change. [ J Nurs Educ . 2022;61(8):447-454.] .</ab>

        <ab>Gender diversity in radiology has centered on the societal construct of the gender binary, with significant work focused on increasing the number of women in radiology. Along with this critically important goal, it is imperative that we acknowledge gender is more expansive than a binary category because it represents a spectrum of gender identities. The discussion of this spectrum is lacking in our conversations around gender diversity and equity in radiology. Addressing equity for people of all gender identities is beneficial for us all. We define three key areas of focus: (1) improving fundamental knowledge about gender diversity and application of this knowledge in education, (2) recruiting and retaining gender-diverse physicians and (3) specific diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy to support gender-affirming environments. Improved understanding and inclusion of the full spectrum of gender in these areas will improve diversity and equity, and, in turn, enhance creativity and innovation in radiology.</ab>

        <ab>Minority faculty and trainees experience unique factors that can hinder their success in academic medicine-collectively referred to as "minority tax." The authors argue that a similar "deaf tax" of unique barriers, experiences, and responsibilities disproportionately burdens deaf trainees and faculty. The cumulative effects of these deaf tax experiences represent a significant disadvantage for deaf professionals in academic medicine. Through a combination of relevant literature and the authors' personal experiences as deaf professionals, several causative domains of deaf tax are outlined, including the fight for reasonable accommodations, prejudice and discrimination, training and diversity barriers, and a lack of deaf mentorship. In addition, a number of practical steps are offered for institutional leaders to consider implementing to improve equity and inclusion in academic medicine, including facilitating language equity and communication access, implementing deaf awareness training, fostering effective deaf mentorship, and promoting deaf professionals into leadership positions. Addressing these issues would help remove the obstacles that create the high deaf tax burden and lower the near-insurmountable barrier of entry, advancement, and retention in academic medicine for deaf professionals.</ab>

        <ab>The ultimate aim of an assessment is to help examiners make valid conclusions about an individual's skill given their performance on a particular measure. Yet, assessing the language abilities of culturally and linguistically diverse individuals requires researchers and practitioners to carefully consider the appropriateness of traditional parameters of test psychometrics (e.g., reliability, or consistency of assessments as measurement) plus the intersectional identities that inform the generalizability of these parameters. The purpose of this clinical focus article is to provide clinicians and researchers with resources to interpret and use common standardized language assessments in English for culturally and linguistically diverse school-age youth. We present theories from psychometrics, legal studies, and education relevant to language assessment of diverse individuals, review standardized language assessments in English, and provide theory-to-practice applications of language assessment scenarios.</ab>
        <ab>Implementing intersectional approaches in working with diverse children and using assessment scores as just one piece of evidence amid a broader evidence base will contribute to a more accurate evaluation of culturally and linguistically diverse children's language abilities. A comprehensive approach involving multiple stakeholders across the field of communication sciences and disorders may support achieving such implementation.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Transgender and gender non-binary (TGNB) individuals face numerous inequalities in healthcare and there is substantial work to be done in fostering TGNB culturally competent care in radiology. A radiology department's online presence and use of gender-inclusive language are essential in promoting an environment of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). The naming of radiology fellowships and continuing medical education (CME) courses with terminology such as "Women's Imaging" indicates a lack of inclusivity to TGNB patients and providers, which could result in suboptimal patient care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all institutions in Canada and the United States (US) offering training in Breast Imaging, Women's Imaging, or Breast and Body Imaging. Data was collected from each institution's radiology department website pertaining to fellowship names, EDI involvement, and CME courses. Results: 8 Canadian and 71 US radiology fellowships were identified. 75% of Canadian and 90% of US fellowships had gender-inclusive names. One (12.5%) Canadian and 29 (41%) US institutions had EDI Committees mentioned on their websites. Among institutions publicly displaying CME courses about breast/body or women's imaging, gender-inclusive names were used in only 1 (25%) of the Canadian CME courses, compared to 81% of the US institutions. Conclusions: Most institutions in Canada and the US have gender-inclusive names for their radiology fellowships pertaining to breast and body imaging. However, there is much opportunity to and arguably the responsibility for institutions in both countries to increase the impact and visibility of their EDI efforts through creation of department-specific committees and CME courses.</ab>

        <ab>Vascular surgery training programs face multiple pressures, including attracting and retaining trainees. Current knowledge of trainees' views with respect to diversity and equity in vascular training programs is limited. We sought to understand United States vascular surgery trainees' perceptions and expectations regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</ab>
        <ab>The Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery designed and administered the Annual Training Survey to specifically address DEI and administered it to all trainees (Integrated Residents/Fellows; n = 637) at 122 institutions in August 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 637 vascular trainees, 227 (35%) responded. The respondents included 115 male and 62 female trainees, with 50 not disclosing or not answering the question. The majority of respondents (96.9%) believed their programs incorporated a diverse background of trainees. Of the trainees, 89.8% felt that the faculty were similarly comprised of a diverse background. The majority of respondents (63.6%) felt that their training program was both more diverse and focused on inclusion compared with other training programs at their institution. However, 20% of respondents had experienced discrimination. Seventy-three percent (n = 143) of trainees felt empowered to disagree or engage in a discussion should they observe a faculty member make a disparaging remark about a patient's background/race/gender, although 27% (n = 35) trainees expressed fear of retaliation as a reason to not engage. Trainees view their program director (82.6%), faculty mentor (60.9%), and Graduate Medical Education office (52.7%) as potential resources for support. Overall, 83.7% (n = 160) of trainees believe that their program has been open to discussion of race relations within the medical community.</ab>
        <ab>Trainees are committed to multifaceted diversity and inclusion. The perception of trainees regarding DEI issues within vascular surgery training programs appears to be positive; however, trainees did describe discrimination and gender biases in their institutions. This data has the potential to improve institutional education of faculty and trainees about the multidimensional levels of diversity and increased awareness and incorporation of this philosophy can assist in the recruitment of diverse vascular surgeons.</ab>

        <ab>The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committee of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) performed a survey whose aim was to explore characteristics of our membership, members' definitions, perceptions, and experiences with DEI in the endocrinology community, and future directions for the organization in this arena.</ab>
        <ab>A cross-sectional study was conducted consisting of an anonymous, self-administered online questionnaire that captured members' demographic and professional data and assessed their responses to questions about DEI in the endocrinology community. The questionnaire was sent to all AACE members (n=4,079) during May and June 2021. A descriptive analysis was performed, and variables were cross-tabulated to find significant associations.</ab>
        <ab>Four hundred thirty members completed the survey (response rate, 10.5%). Respondents considered a wide array of demographic variables in their definition of diversity, and most perceived the endocrine community to be diverse. Almost half of respondents reported discrimination in their workplace, with women being more likely to report it. Respondents prioritized addressing health care inequities, providing a mentorship program, and providing educational material and resources about DEI as the highest priorities for the organization in this space.</ab>
        <ab>AACE DEI survey data revealed a diverse AACE membership. Member perspectives will aid in creating a roadmap to broaden DEI among the greater endocrine community.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last decade, health care professionals in the field of radiology have experienced increasing rates of burnout. A study in 2017 showed high prevalence of burnout in pediatric radiology, and other studies have identified several drivers for burnout. An important factor in promoting wellness and mitigating burnout is leveraging diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. This manuscript highlights the importance of diversity in high-functioning teams as well as the critical role of equity and inclusion in the workplace to help create an organization where people belong and can effectively succeed.</ab>

        <ab>Without specific attention to health equity considerations in design, implementation, and evaluation, the rapid expansion of digital health approaches threatens to exacerbate rather than ameliorate existing health disparities.</ab>
        <ab>We explored known factors that increase digital health inequity to contextualize the need for equity-centered informatics. This work used a narrative review method to summarize issues about inequities in digital health and to discuss future directions for researchers and clinicians. We searched literature using a combination of relevant keywords (e.g., "digital health", "health equity", etc.) using PubMed and Google Scholar.</ab>
        <ab>We have highlighted strategies for addressing medical marginalization in informatics according to vectors of power such as race and ethnicity, gender identity and modality, sexuality, disability, housing status, citizenship status, and criminalization status.</ab>
        <ab>We have emphasized collaboration with user and patient groups to define priorities, ensure accessibility and localization, and consider risks in development and utilization of digital health tools. Additionally, we encourage consideration of potential pitfalls in adopting these diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-related strategies.</ab>

        <ab>Women, underrepresented minorities, and international medical graduates are underrepresented in urology. We sought to compare demographics of leaders in academic urology to urology faculty and academic medical faculty.</ab>
        <ab>The Association of American Medical Colleges provided academic medical faculty demographics. Women, underrepresented minorities, and international medical graduates in leadership roles (department/division chair or full professor) were identified. Fisher's exact tests were performed to compare proportions of those groups in urology leadership to academic urology, academic medicine leadership, and academic medicine.</ab>
        <ab>In 2019, there were 179,105 faculty in academic medicine with 41,766 in leadership and 1,614 faculty in urology with 567 in leadership. Significantly fewer women were in urology leadership compared to academic urology (7.4% vs. 22.0%, p &lt; 0.0001), academic medical leadership (7.4% vs. 25.0%, p &lt; 0.0001), and academic medicine (7.4% vs. 42.0%, p &lt; 0.0001). Significantly fewer underrepresented minorities were in urology leadership compared to academic medicine (6.9% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.04) with no significant difference when compared to urology faculty (6.9% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.4) or medical faculty leadership (6.9% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.6). Significantly more international medical graduates were in urology leadership compared to across academic urology, (32% vs. 24%, p = 0.0006), but significantly fewer than those in leadership across all medical specialties (32% vs. 40%, p = 0.0001).</ab>
        <ab>Women and underrepresented minorities are significantly underrepresented in academic urologic leadership while international medical graduates are statistically overrepresented. Considering calls for diversity, equity, and inclusion, these data highlight a need for increased representation in leadership positions in academic urology.</ab>

        <ab>Orthopaedic surgery is one of the most competitive but least diverse surgical specialties, with ever-increasing academic achievements (such as test scores) shown by applicants. Prior research shows that white applicants had higher United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores as well as higher odds of Alpha Omega Alpha status compared with Black, Hispanic, and other applicant groups. Yet, it still remains unknown whether differences in application metrics by race/ethnicity sufficiently explain the underrepresentation of certain racial or ethnic minority groups in orthopaedic residency programs.</ab>
        <ab>In this study, we sought to determine (1) the relative weight of academic variables for admission into orthopaedic residency, and (2) whether race and gender are independently associated with admission into an orthopedic residency.</ab>
        <ab>The Electronic Residency Application System (ERAS) data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) of first-time MD applicants (n = 8966) for orthopaedic surgery residency positions in the United States and of admitted orthopaedic residents (n = 6218) from 2005 to 2014 were reviewed. This dataset is the first and most comprehensive of its kind to date in orthopaedic surgery. Academic metrics, such as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores, number of publications, Alpha Omega Alpha status, volunteer experiences, work experience, as well as race and gender, were analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression models. The first model analyzed the association of academic metrics with admission into orthopaedic residency. In the second model, we added race and gender and controlled for metrics of academic performance. To determine how well the models simulated the actual admissions data, we computed the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) including the area under curve (AUC), which measures the model's ability to simulate which applicants were admitted or not admitted, with an AUC = 1.0 representing a perfect simulation. The odds ratio and confidence interval of each variable were computed.</ab>
        <ab>When only academic variables were analyzed in the first model, Alpha Omega Alpha status (odds ratio 2.12 [95% CI 1.80 to 2.50]; p &lt; 0.001), the USMLE Step 1 score (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.04]; p &lt; 0.001), the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge score (OR 1.01 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.02]; p &lt; 0.001), publication count (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.05]; p &lt; 0.001), and volunteer experience (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.04]; p &lt; 0.001) were associated with admissions into orthopaedics while work and research experience were not. This model yielded a good prediction of the results with an AUC of 0.755. The second model, in which the variables of race and gender were added to the academic variables, also had a good prediction of the results with an AUC of 0.759. This model indicates that applicant race, but not gender, is associated with admissions into orthopaedic residency. Applicants from Asian (OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.92]), Black (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.77], Hispanic (OR 0.48 [95% CI 0.36 to 0.65]), or other race groups (OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.55 to 0.77]) had lower odds of admission into residency compared with white applicants.</ab>
        <ab>Minority applicants, but not women, have lower odds of admission into orthopaedic surgery residency, even when accounting for academic performance metrics. Changes in the residency selection processes are needed to eliminate the lower admission probability of qualified minority applicants in orthopaedic residency and to improve the diversity and inclusion of orthopaedic surgery. Changes including increasing the diversity of the selection committee, bias training, blinding applications before review, removal of metrics with history of racial disparities from an interviewer's candidate profile before an interview, and use of holistic application review (where an applicants' experiences, attributes, and academic metrics are all considered) can improve the diversity landscape in training. In addition, cultivating an environment of inclusion will be necessary to address these long-standing trends in orthopaedic surgery.</ab>
        <ab>Race, but not gender, is associated with the odds of acceptance into orthopaedic surgery residency despite equivalent academic metrics. Changes in residency selection processes are suggested to eliminate the lower admission probability of qualified minority applicants into orthopaedic residency and to improve the diversity and inclusion of orthopaedic surgery.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion have been recognized as important drivers of excellence and innovation in the physician workforce. Given the historical underrepresentation of women in medicine, gender diversity is of interest. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to quantify leadership representation of female physicians in primary care sports medicine settings, including primary care sports medicine fellowship programs, select sports medicine societies, and select sports medicine-related scientific journals. Data were collected by querying the corresponding web site for each fellowship program, society, and journal and analyzed in a descriptive manner. Results showed that fewer female physicians hold primary care sports medicine leadership roles than men do. This work establishes a baseline for female representation in primary care sports medicine leadership; efforts should continue to increase the presence of women in leadership positions.</ab>

        <ab>Despite their increased enrollment into medical school, women still face systemic barriers in medicine, whether in an academic or nonacademic setting. Those from Under-Represented Minority (URM) groups face similar issues, which may affect their desire to enter, pursue, and/or maintain a career in medicine. Social media provides unique opportunities for peer-to-peer support among members of URM communities and for amplification of their voices calling for social justice-here defined as a redistribution of power and the quest for equity in access to opportunities, including access to mentorship, professional development, and timely promotion in academic rank. These issues are relevant to oncologists especially as we strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion and to ensure that our patients have equal access to care, regardless of their circumstances. In this article, we review current literature that highlights issues faced by women and historically URM groups in medicine, particularly in oncology. We also discuss the physician's role as a social justice advocate and the concept of the public physician.</ab>

        <ab>Climate change and the destruction of ecosystems by human activities are among the greatest challenges of the 21st century and require urgent action. Health care activities significantly contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases and waste production, with gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy being one of the largest contributors. This Position Statement aims to raise awareness of the ecological footprint of GI endoscopy and provides guidance to reduce its environmental impact. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) outline suggestions and recommendations for health care providers, patients, governments, and industry. MAIN STATEMENTS 1: GI endoscopy is a resource-intensive activity with a significant yet poorly assessed environmental impact. 2: ESGE-ESGENA recommend adopting immediate actions to reduce the environmental impact of GI endoscopy. 3: ESGE-ESGENA recommend adherence to guidelines and implementation of audit strategies on the appropriateness of GI endoscopy to avoid the environmental impact of unnecessary procedures. 4: ESGE-ESGENA recommend the embedding of reduce, reuse, and recycle programs in the GI endoscopy unit. 5: ESGE-ESGENA suggest that there is an urgent need to reassess and reduce the environmental and economic impact of single-use GI endoscopic devices. 6: ESGE-ESGENA suggest against routine use of single-use GI endoscopes. However, their use could be considered in highly selected patients on a case-by-case basis. 7: ESGE-ESGENA recommend inclusion of sustainability in the training curricula of GI endoscopy and as a quality domain. 8: ESGE-ESGENA recommend conducting high quality research to quantify and minimize the environmental impact of GI endoscopy. 9: ESGE-ESGENA recommend that GI endoscopy companies assess, disclose, and audit the environmental impact of their value chain. 10:  ESGE-ESGENA recommend that GI endoscopy should become a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions practice by 2050.</ab>

        <ab>Diversification of the Translational Science workforce is a strategic goal for the National Center for the Advancement of Translational Science (NCATS) program. NCATS has identified the development of translational science education, training, and support for a diverse translational science workforce as key to advancing the growing field of translational science. An annual mixed-methods assessment has been conducted on Common Metrics data submitted by over 60 Clinical &amp; Translational Science Awards (CTSA) programs nationwide and includes metrics addressing recruitment and retention of scientists with particular attention to underrepresented persons and women. This article describes a methodology for the development of From Insights to Action , a resource for guiding program implementation and strategic planning to develop a diverse clinical and translational science workforce. This was informed by the Common Metrics Initiative process and constituted of findings from qualitative interviews of a subset of CTSAs that participated. The dissemination of this guide had several impacts, including providing structural foci for the CTSA Fall 2020 program meeting centered on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in translational science; addressing NCATS' goal of workforce diversity; and understanding the number of diverse graduates still engaged in research.</ab>

        <ab>Over the last two decades, medical schools and academic health centers have acknowledged the persistence of health disparities in their patients and the lack of diversity in their faculty, leaders and extended workforce. We established an Office of Health Equity and Inclusion (OHEI) at our pediatric academic medical center after a thorough evaluation of prior diversity initiatives and review of faculty development data.</ab>
        <ab>To describe the lessons learned at a pediatric academic medical center in prioritizing and implementing health equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) initiatives in creating the OHEI.</ab>
        <ab>We reviewed internal administrative data and faculty development data, including data related to faculty who are underrepresented in medicine, to understand the role of our EDI initiatives in the strategic priorities addressed and lessons learned in the creation of the OHEI.</ab>
        <ab>The intentional steps taken in our medical center's strategic approach in the creation of this office led to four important lessons to improve pediatric health equity: (1) board, senior executive and institutional prioritization of EDI initiatives; (2) multi-specialty and interprofessional collaboration; (3) academic approach to EDI programmatic development; and (4) intentionality with accountability in all EDI initiatives.</ab>
        <ab>The key lessons learned during the creation of an Office of Health Equity and Inclusion can provide guidance to other academic health centers committed to implementing institutional priorities that focus their EDI initiatives on the improvement of pediatric health equity.</ab>

        <ab>Women and people of color are often underrepresented in medicine. This study examined the inclusivity and diversity of the recent history of the Canadian Association of Thoracic Surgeons (CATS) in both its executive committees and invited participation at its annual meeting.</ab>
        <ab>CATS internal records and previous programs of CATS annual meetings were reviewed from 1997 to 2020. Leadership positions, invited speakers, and award recipients were categorized by sex and race.</ab>
        <ab>Of 199 CATS members in 2020, 93 (47%) were White men, 64 (32%) were men of color, 24 (12%) were White women, and 18 (9%) were women of color. The majority of CATS presidents (86%), committee chairs (57%), named lecturers (88%), other invited speakers (67%), and major award winners (90%) were White men. Women and people of color were underrepresented. The Resident Research Award was the most diverse: of 23 awards, 10 (44%) have been to men of color, 6 (26%) to White men, 4 (15%) to women of color, and 2 (8%) to White women.</ab>
        <ab>There is a need for more representation and inclusion of both women and people of color at multiple levels in CATS. This includes opportunities for improvement in the make-up of its executive committees, the speakers at its annual conference, and the recipients of its awards. CATS has established an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Task Force to address this critical issue.</ab>

        <ab>The success of mentoring derives from active and respectful listening and the willingness to learn and accept opportunities for personal growth. This shapes every trainee and their destined path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The act of cultivating rapport, asking, and pondering meaningful questions, and receiving constructive feedback are critical to support a productive mentoring relationship. Successful mentoring in STEM can be established and allow mentees, especially underrepresented minorities (URMs), to flourish in an environment where they feel welcomed and supported. However, mentees from underrepresented groups often experience inadequate mentoring due to a mentor's lack of awareness, poor trainings themselves, or lack of understanding of the mentee's hardships. It is important for mentors and mentees to work together to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM education through creativity, authenticity, and networking. We analyzed data obtained from students who attended a recent workshop that are interested in going to graduate school. Our results show that despite low initial expectations for the workshop, many students were satisfied in the knowledge they gleaned. The future and role of diversity in STEM within these underrepresented groups lies in community support and an important role that they can play in the lives of others through DEI initiatives and throughout their careers all of which involves positive mentoring.</ab>

        <ab>The open science framework has garnered increased visibility and has been partially implemented in recent years. Open science underscores the importance of transparency and reproducibility to conduct rigorous science. Recently, several journals published by the American Psychological Association have begun adopting the open science framework. At the same time, the field of psychology has been reckoning with the current sociopolitical climate regarding anti-Blackness and White supremacy. As psychology begins to adopt the open science framework into its journals, the authors underscore the importance of embracing and aligning open science with frameworks and theories that have the potential to move the field toward antiracism and away from the embedded White supremacy value systems and ideals. The present article provides an overview of the open science framework; an examination of White supremacy ideology in research and publishing; guidance on how to move away from these pernicious values; and a proposal on alternate value systems to center equity, diversity, and inclusion with the aim of establishing an antiracist open science framework.

        <ab>The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by retaining and advancing Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) individuals in the discipline of communication sciences and disorders (CSD), amid critical shortages of faculty to train the next generation of practitioners and researchers. Publishing research is central to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty. However, inequity in peer review may systematically target BIPOC scholars, adding yet another barrier to their success as faculty. This viewpoint article addresses the challenge of inequity in peer review and provides some practical strategies for developing equitable peer-review practices. First, we describe the demographics of ASHA constituents, including those holding research doctorates, who would typically be involved in peer review. Next, we explore the peer-review process, describing how inequity in peer review may adversely impact BIPOC authors or research with BIPOC communities. Finally, we offer real-world examples of and a framework for equitable peer review.</ab>
        <ab>Inequity at the individual and systemic levels in peer review can harm BIPOC CSD authors. Such inequity has effects not limited to peer review itself and exerts long-term adverse effects on the recruitment, retention, and advancement of BIPOC faculty in CSD. To uphold ASHA's commitment to DEI and to move the discipline of CSD forward, it is imperative to build equity into the editorial structure for publishing, the composition of editorial boards, and journals content. While we focus on inequity in CSD, these issues are relevant to other disciplines.</ab>

        <ab>A narrative review of research obtained via several databases, including PubMed and Medline, was conducted.</ab>
        <ab>A vision of equity and inclusion, which meets the need of the heterogeneous UK population, can only be realized by adopting a culturally competent approach to systems-wide working in organ donation in four core areas-transplant services; workforce and staff training; diversity and inclusion research; and public engagement.</ab>
        <ab>Most of the data on the background of organ donors and recipients use general categories such as Asian or Black. We need to progress to a position of more granular data by more specific ethnicity so that we can better understand the trends and target action accordingly.</ab>
        <ab>By positively embracing the heterogeneity of the UK population, demand for transplantation can be reduced through a sustained commitment to public health interventions and culturally competent approaches in the management of long-term conditions.</ab>
        <ab>Improved access to transplantation and reduced waiting times can be achieved to increase the number of organ donors from minority ethnic groups if there are concerted and adequately resourced culturally competent interventions with concomitant evaluation programmes.</ab>

        <ab>There are growing bodies of evidence demonstrating the benefits of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) on academic and organizational excellence. In turn, some editors have stated their desire to improve the EDI of their journals and of the wider scientific community. The Royal Society of Chemistry established a minimum set of requirements aimed at improving EDI in scholarly publishing. Additionally, several resources were reported to have the potential to improve EDI, but their effectiveness and feasibility are yet to be determined. In this commentary we suggest six approaches, based on the Royal Society of Chemistry set of requirements, that journals could implement to improve EDI. They are: (1) adopt a journal EDI statement with clear, actionable steps to achieve it; (2) promote the use of inclusive and bias-free language; (3) appoint a journal's EDI director or lead; (4) establish a EDI mentoring approach; (5) monitor adherence to EDI principles; and (6) publish reports on EDI actions and achievements. We also provide examples of journals that have implemented some of these strategies, and discuss the roles of peer reviewers, authors, researchers, academic institutes, and funders in improving EDI.</ab>

        <ab>Mental health-related professions, like many fields, have begun reexamining common practices and opportunities following the 2020 reawakening to the need for antiracist practices/policies. This push includes encouraging both seasoned professionals and newer trainees to do inward and outward work to increase self- and other-awareness and recognize biases. Often, it is unclear where to begin, and this deeper reflection can bring up uncomfortable realizations about oneself, colleagues, and even broader professions. Doing this deep work is most beneficial when done in a community that can provide support and further challenge. Thus, the practice of reflective supervision/consultation (RSC) is well-suited for integration of conversations about bias (implicit and explicit) as well as racism/antiracism. The current paper provides background on these concepts, the model of RSC, and specific examples of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles within the infant and early childhood mental health (IECMH) field. Parallels are drawn to existing "key concepts" of reflective supervision to provide examples for integrating conversations about bias into reflective supervision. Finally, specific tools and strategies for use are offered as starting points, with encouragement for supervisors to continue to generate ideas and tools for these important conversations. Next steps and implications for broader practice are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Achieving optimal health for all requires confronting the complex legacies of colonialism and white supremacy embedded in all institutions, including health care institutions. As a result, health care organizations committed to health equity must build the capacity of their staff to recognize the contemporary manifestations of these legacies within the organization and to act to eliminate them. In a culture of equity, all employees-individually and collectively-identify and reflect on the organizational dynamics that reproduce health inequities and engage in activities to transform them. The authors describe 5 interconnected change strategies that their medical center uses to build a culture of equity. First, the medical center deliberately grounds diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts (DEI) in critical theory, aiming to illuminate social structures through critical analysis of power relations. Second, its training goes beyond cultural competency and humility to include critical consciousness, which includes the ability to critically analyze conditions in the organizational and broader societal contexts that produce health inequities and act to transform them. Third, it works to strengthen relationships so they can be change vehicles. Fourth, it empowers an implementation team that models a culture of equity. Finally, it aligns equity-focused culture transformation with equity-focused operations transformation to support transformative praxis. These 5 strategies are not a panacea. However, emerging processes and outcomes at the medical center indicate that they may reduce the likelihood of ahistorical and power-blind approaches to equity initiatives and provide employees with some of the critical missing knowledge and skills they need to address the root causes of health inequity.</ab>

        <ab>A total of 226 surveys were sent out with a 22.6% response rate. Across all survey respondents, only 28.2% of surgeons were female and 24.4% were URiM, with no programs reporting any non-binary surgeons. In the last 3 years, 95.8% programs reported an increase in female surgeons, while only 75.5% programs reported an increase in URiM surgeons. Program size made no difference in diversity across race or gender.</ab>

        <ab>Thoughtful clinical trial design is critical for efficient therapeutic development, particularly in the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where trials often aim to detect modest treatment effects among a population with heterogeneous disease progression. Appropriate outcome measure selection is necessary for trials to provide decisive and informative results. Investigators must consider the outcome measure's reliability, responsiveness to detect change when change has actually occurred, clinical relevance, and psychometric performance. ALS clinical trials can also be performed more efficiently by utilizing statistical enrichment techniques. Innovations in ALS prediction models allow for selection of participants with less heterogeneity in disease progression rates without requiring a lead-in period, or participants can be stratified according to predicted progression. Statistical enrichment can reduce the needed sample size and improve study power, but investigators must find a balance between optimizing statistical efficiency and retaining generalizability of study findings to the broader ALS population. Additional progress is still needed for biomarker development and validation to confirm target engagement in ALS treatment trials. Selection of an appropriate biofluid biomarker depends on the treatment mechanism of interest, and biomarker studies should be incorporated into early phase trials. Inclusion of patients with ALS as advisors and advocates can strengthen clinical trial design and study retention, but more engagement efforts are needed to improve diversity and equity in ALS research studies. Another challenge for ALS therapeutic development is identifying ways to respect patient autonomy and improve access to experimental treatment, something that is strongly desired by many patients with ALS and ALS advocacy organizations. Expanded access programs that run concurrently to well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials may provide an opportunity to broaden access to promising therapeutics without compromising scientific integrity or rushing regulatory approval of therapies without adequate proof of efficacy.</ab>

        <ab>The number of disabled students enrolled in higher education institutions is increasing. Yet in disciplines such as nursing, where placements are an important part of student success, students' lived experiences, though an important and necessary aspect of promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion, has been ignored. In this paper, we respond to such issues by creating and utilizing a novel storytelling method that harnesses the antiessentialist philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Storytelling empowers students to both describe their experiences and inform institutions on how to better serve them, and we use concepts from Deleuze and Guattari to provide a framework for thinking about students and their pathways toward success as multiple. As we show, applying storytelling as a method through this lens offers an expansion of strategies to put students first and, therefore, promote equity at the administrative, research, educational, and practical levels. We describe how thinking rhizomatically opens new avenues of insight, allowing for the creation of institutional assemblages based on a diverse array of students' needs, enabling them to become successful in their own ways.</ab>

        <ab>The growing racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity within the United States underscores the importance of neuropsychologists developing cultural competence to improve patient care and support increased practitioner diversity. APA has recognized the importance of expanding the field's diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) efforts to promote the retention of historically underrepresented practitioners and culturally competent practices. Supervisors and mentors are particularly well suited and ethically required to support DEIB-related professional development in their trainees. However, current literature suggests that a lack of time and perceived lack of competence in initiating and facilitating these conversations remain barriers to DEIB efforts. This paper aims to increase a supervisor's/mentor's self-efficacy in facilitating these efforts. We offer adapted theoretical models of cultural competence and provide a "tool kit" of experiential activities adapted for neuropsychologists that can be utilized to support the initiation, maintenance, and quality of DEIB-focused discussions within these relationships.</ab>

        <ab>African American and Black scientists are awarded disproportionately fewer National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants than White scientists. Increasing Black representation on NIH scientific review groups (SRGs) likely will contribute to increased equity in funding rates because research topics of Black and African American scientists' submitted applications will be more highly valued; however, Black and African American scientists often perceive barriers that prevent them from serving on NIH SRGs.</ab>
        <ab>To examine perceived barriers that prevent Black and African American scientists from serving on NIH SRGs.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study used a mixed methods online approach with a convenience sample of Black and African American scientists to identify barriers to NIH grant review participation. Eligible participants were recruited online from professional organizations with primarily Black and African American membership. From February through April 2021, participants were asked to identify barriers to serving on NIH SRGs using concept mapping. Participants brainstormed statements describing barriers to serving on NIH SRGs, sorted statements into content themes, and rated statements on how true they were. Multidimensional scaling and a hierarchical cluster analysis identified content themes. Data analysis was conducted in May and June of 2021.</ab>
        <ab>Self-reported barriers to serving on an NIH SRG among Black and African American scientists.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 52 scientists participated in both phases of the study (mean [SD] age, 42.3 [8.2] years; 46 women [88.5%]). Participants provided 68 unique statements that were organized into 9 thematic clusters describing barriers to serving on NIH SRGs. Themes included structural racism, diversity not valued, toxic environment, review workload demand, lack of reward, negative affect about the review process, competing demands at home institution, lack of opportunity, and perceptions of being unqualified.</ab>
        <ab>Black and African American scientists reported many barriers to serving on NIH SRGs that are unique to Black and African American scientists, as well as barriers that transcend race but are exacerbated by structural racism. This study provides NIH with concrete opportunities to address realized barriers to increase inclusion of Black and African American scientists on NIH SRGs, fund more Black and African American scientists, and ultimately reduce health inequities in the US.</ab>

        <ab>Historically, in the United States, nursing programs reflected practices that systematically discriminated against Black students and nurses.</ab>
        <ab>The authors investigated historical nursing school admission policies to determine if racist practices existed that impeded Black students' ability to access formal nurse training programs. This study further examined whether those historical discriminating practices continue to exist in schools of nursing today and if admission policies in a Southern School of Nursing contributed to inequitable admission of students. Current recommendations for increasing diversity, equity and inclusion in nursing schools will be addressed.</ab>
        <ab>This study combines social-historical archival research with a case study of the racial breakdown of applied versus admitted nursing students at a Southern university.</ab>
        <ab>School of Nursing admission data (2019-2021) demonstrate discrepancies in the distribution of admitted students by race, reflecting the ongoing effects of systematic discrimination.</ab>
        <ab>In the United States, the nursing profession is pursuing strategies to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, the lingering effects of policies that systematically built barriers keeping underrepresented groups from earning a nursing education persist. Holistic admission is one way that nursing programs can address this inequity.</ab>

        <ab>Recent initiatives have emphasized the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery. Racial/ethnic disparities remain prevalent throughout surgical training, and the "diversity pipeline" in resident recruitment and retention remains poorly defined.</ab>
        <ab>Data was retrospectively collected using two separate datasets. The Association of American Medical Colleges database was used to obtain demographic data on US medical school graduates. The US Graduate Medical Education annual report was used to obtain demographic data on surgical residents. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare racial/ethnic distribution within surgical residency programs with graduating medical students. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze population trends over time.</ab>
        <ab>The study population included 184,690 surgical residents from 2011 to 2020. Nine resident cohorts were created according to surgical specialty - general surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, urology, and vascular surgery. Among surgical programs, White residents were overrepresented in 8 of 9 specialties compared to the concurrent graduating medical student class for all years (p &lt; 0.01 each, no difference in ophthalmology). Black residents were underrepresented in 8 of 9 specialties (p &lt; 0.01 each, no difference in general surgery). Asian representation was mixed among specialties (4 overrepresented, 1 equal, 4 underrepresented), as was Hispanic representation (5 overrepresented, 4 equal) (p &lt; 0.01 each).</ab>
        <ab>These data suggest that racial/ethnic disparities are inherent to the process of recruitment and retention of surgical residents. Efforts to improve the "diversity pipeline" should focus on mentorship and development of minority medical students and creating an equitable learning environment.</ab>

        <ab>Many will draw distinctions between finding your purpose and tapping into spirituality. And many more are quick to point out that they are spiritual but not religious. This predictable definitional dynamic makes me doubtful that adoption of purpose finding strategies will be the gateway to unlocking the ambivalence and stigma related to sharing one's faith in company settings. Drawing from tenets that drive social epidemics, wellness professionals and faith leaders travel in 'closed circles' and it will take 'connectors' with ties in both circles to spread the idea that workplace wellness and faith traditions can have positive synergies. Healthy People 2030 defines health and well-being as "how people think, feel, and function-at a personal and social level-and how they evaluate their lives as a whole." This editorial describes components of faith friendly organizations and argues that employee resource groups and trends in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives could be a catalyst for greater openness to including people's faith traditions as a part of bringing their whole selves to work.</ab>

        <ab>Improving the diversity and representation in the medical workforce requires intentional and deliberate efforts to improve the pipeline and pathway for underrepresented in medicine (UIM) applicants. Diversity enhances educational experiences and improves patient care and outcomes. Through a critical review of the literature, in this article we offer evidence-based guidelines for physician pipeline and pathway programs (PP). Recommendations are provided regarding considerations on the types of programs and surrounding implementation to ensure a sound infrastructure and framework. We believe this guide will be valuable for all leaders and faculty members seeking to grow the UIM applicant pool in our efforts to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within medicine.</ab>

        <ab>The nation's largest public health care system, New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H + H), is engaged in a fundamental transformation of its nursing culture, actualizing many of the recommendations in the National Academies, The Future of Nursing 2020-2030: Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity. NYC H + H and its more than 9600+ nurses and 970+ social workers share a common public health mission, vision, and values to deliver essential health care services to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society, regardless of ethnicity, culture, creed, gender, age, sexual orientation, income, immigration, or insurance status. This mission dovetails with all of the recommendations in the Future of Nursing report. Systemwide implementation of these recommendations is proceeding, with some programs further advanced than others. This article highlights the system's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; nursing professional development; collaboration with academic partners; labor contract provisions to support recruitment and retention campaigns; technological advances to remove barriers to patient care; and nurse residency program and professional-shared governance implementation. NYC H + H safeguards 1.4 million patients annually, caring for 1 in every 6 New Yorkers through 11 essential hospitals, 5 post-acute care facilities, more than 70 community centers, and correctional health services in city jails.</ab>

        <ab>Surgical residents are increasingly concerned about inequities in patient access and outcomes. This study reviews general surgery residency programs websites for educational and community-focused efforts to recognize and intervene on the root causes of structural inequities.</ab>
        <ab>We reviewed the websites of the 332 ACGME-accredited general surgery residency programs for mission statement, curriculum and research details in addition to diversity, equity and inclusion statements. Through deductive coding, we pursued a thematic analysis of visible and intentional steps to incorporate and emphasize surgical equity in surgical training.</ab>
        <ab>The majority (76%) of training program websites do not mention healthcare inequity. Of the programs that do, 24 (7% of all residencies reviewed) describe initiatives, including an endowed lectureship in anti-racism and community engagement work.</ab>
        <ab>We identified efforts to prioritize surgical equity at general surgery residency programs across a range of resources and settings. This review of public efforts toward equity highlights opportunities for programs to engage with their trainees and communities.</ab>

        <ab>A concerted commitment across research stakeholders is necessary to increase equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and address barriers to cancer clinical trial recruitment and participation. Racial and ethnic diversity among trial participants is key to understanding intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may affect patient response to cancer treatments. This ASCO and Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) Research Statement presents specific recommendations and strategies for the research community to improve EDI in cancer clinical trials. There are six overarching recommendations: (1) clinical trials are an integral component of high-quality cancer care, and every person with cancer should have the opportunity to participate; (2) trial sponsors and investigators should design and implement trials with a focus on reducing barriers and enhancing EDI, and work with sites to conduct trials in ways that increase participation of under-represented populations; (3) trial sponsors, researchers, and sites should form long-standing partnerships with patients, patient advocacy groups, and community leaders and groups; (4) anyone designing or conducting trials should complete recurring education, training, and evaluation to demonstrate and maintain cross-cultural competencies, mitigation of bias, effective communication, and a commitment to achieving EDI; (5) research stakeholders should invest in programs and policies that increase EDI in trials and in the research workforce; and (6) research stakeholders should collect and publish aggregate data on racial and ethnic diversity of trial participants when reporting results of trials, programs, and interventions to increase EDI. The recommendations are intended to serve as a guide for the research community to improve participation rates among people from racial and ethnic minority populations historically under-represented in cancer clinical trials. ASCO and ACCC will work at all levels to advance the recommendations in this publication.</ab>

        <ab>Inclusive and equitable research is an ethical imperative. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) as well as human-centered design are approaches that center partnership between community members and academic researchers. Together, academic-community research teams iteratively study community priorities, collaboratively develop ethical study designs, and co-create innovations that are accessible and meaningful to the community partners while advancing science. The foundation of the CBPR approach is reliant on its core principles of equity, colearning, shared power in decision-making, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. While the CBPR approach has been used extensively in public health and other areas of healthcare research, the approach is relatively new to audiology, otolaryngology, and hearing health research. The purpose of the present article is to advance an understanding of the CBPR approach, along with principles from human-centered design, in the context of research aimed to advance equity and access in hearing healthcare.</ab>
        <ab>The literature is reviewed to provide an introduction for auditory scientists to the CBPR approach and human-centered design, including discussion of the underlying principles of CBPR and where it fits along a community-engaged continuum, theoretical and evaluation frameworks, as well as applications within auditory research.</ab>
        <ab>Recent applications of CBPR have been framed broadly within the theoretical positions of the socioecological model for a systems-level approach to community-engaged research and the Health Services Utilization model within health services and disparities research using CBPR. Utilizing human-centered design strategies can work in tandem with a CBPR approach to engage a wide range of people in the research process and move toward the development of innovative yet feasible solutions.</ab>
        <ab>Leveraging the principles of CBPR is an intricate and dynamic process, may not be a fit for some topics, some researchers' skillsets, and may be beyond some projects' resources. When implemented skillfully and authentically, CBPR can be of benefit by elevating and empowering community voices and cultural perspectives historically marginalized in society and underrepresented within research. With a focus on health equity, this review of CBPR in the study of hearing healthcare emphasizes how this approach to research can help to advance inclusion, diversity, and access to innovation.</ab>

        <ab>Standardized testing has been utilized by K-12 schools, undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as employers. Historically, it has been seen as an efficacious way to identify the best performing candidates to receive program entry or move forward in a hiring process. However, there is significant evidence mounting about the limitations of standardized testing and, yet, we persist with them because of their relative ease. The purpose of this perspective paper is to begin a conversation about the place of standardized tests in dental education and its relationship to institution goals related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>On the 75th anniversary of the founding of the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 11 of the surviving chairs of the board convened virtually to reflect on the past 40 years of major trends for the accrediting body of physiatrists. The field rapidly expanded in the 1980s, driven by changes in the reimbursement environment. This rapid expansion drove an improvement in the caliber of residents choosing the field and in the quality of training programs. As physical medicine and rehabilitation evolved from a small- to medium-sized specialty, the board addressed many challenges: securing a credible position within the American Board of Medical Specialties; addressing a rising demand for subspecialty certification; improving training and exposure to physiatry; enhancing the quality of the accreditation process; and reducing the burden of accreditation on diplomates. The future development of physiatry includes improving diversity, equity, and inclusion, while restoring provider morale, well-being, and meaningfulness in work. Although challenges remain, physiatry as a field has grown to be well established through the board's efforts and respected within the larger medical community.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion within the healthcare workforce are conducive to providing culturally competent care. However, few existing studies have assessed the level of racial and ethnic diversity among resident physicians and residency applicants. Our objective was to provide a comparative analysis of the trends in racial and ethnic representation within different subspecialties in medicine.</ab>
        <ab>Using data from the American Association of Medical Colleges and the Journal of the American Medical Association, we evaluated the racial and ethnic identification of residency applicants and current residents in 9 procedural-focused specialties from 2005 to 2019 and performed a descriptive analysis to compare the different levels of racial and ethnic diversity in these specialties.</ab>
        <ab>Among the specialties analyzed during the study period, neurosurgery had the greatest magnitude of differences between Black/African-American residency applicants and current residents. The percentage of Black/African-American applicants was 92% greater than that of Black/African-American residents (10% of applicants vs. 5.2% of residents). In contrast, the percentage of White neurosurgery residents was 17.6% greater than that of White neurosurgery applicants (53.9% of applicants vs. 63.4% of residents). Similar trends were noted in all the specialties evaluated. Obstetrics and gynecology demonstrated the least disparity between Black/African-American applicants and residents (13.7% of applicants vs. 10.2% of residents; 35.4% difference). Hispanic and Asian representation varied widely between specialties.</ab>
        <ab>Among the surveyed specialties, neurosurgery demonstrated the greatest disparity between the percentage of Black/African-American residency applicants and current residents. To further drive progress in this domain, we advocate for a series of initiatives designed to increase underrepresented minority participation in neurosurgery practice and scholarship.</ab>

        <ab>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers a high burden of uremic symptoms that may be underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. Unpleasant symptoms, such as CKD-associated pruritus and emotional/psychological distress, often occur within symptom clusters, and treating 1 symptom may potentially alleviate other symptoms in that cluster. The Living Well with Kidney Disease and Effective Symptom Management Consensus Conference convened health experts and leaders of kidney advocacy groups and kidney networks worldwide to discuss the effects of unpleasant symptoms related to CKD on the health and well-being of those affected, and to consider strategies for optimal symptom management. Optimizing symptom management is a cornerstone of conservative and preservative management which aim to prevent or delay dialysis initiation. In persons with kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis (KDRD), incremental transition to dialysis and home dialysis modalities offer personalized approaches. KDRD is proposed as the preferred term given the negative connotations of "failure" as a kidney descriptor, and the success stories in CKD journeys. Engaging persons with CKD to identify and prioritize their personal values and individual needs must be central to ensure their active participation in CKD management, including KDRD. Person-centered communication and care are required to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion; education/awareness that considers the health literacy of persons with CKD; and shared decision-making among the person with CKD, care partners, and providers. By putting the needs of people with CKD, including effective symptom management, at the center of their treatment, CKD can be optimally treated in a way that aligns with their goals.</ab>

        <ab>Medical schools aim to select and train future physicians representative of and able to serve their diverse population needs. Enhancing equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in admissions processes includes identifying and mitigating barriers for those underrepresented in medicine (URM).</ab>
        <ab>In 2017, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry (Western University, Ontario, Canada) critically reviewed its general Admissions pathways for the Doctor of Medicine (MD) program. Till that time, interview invitations were primarily based on academic metrics rather than a holistic review as for its Indigenous MD Admissions pathway. To help diversify the Canadian physician workforce, Schulich Medicine utilized a multipronged approach with five key changes implemented over 2 years into the general MD Admissions pathways: 1. A voluntary applicant diversity survey (race, socioeconomic status, and community size) to examine potential barriers within the Admissions process; 2. Diversification of the admissions committee and evaluator pool with the inclusion of an Equity Representative on the admissions committee; 3. A biosketch for applicants' life experiences; 4. Implicit bias awareness training for Committee members, file reviewers and interviewers; and 5. A specific pathway for applicants with financial, sociocultural, and medical barriers (termed ACCESS pathway). Diversity data before (Class of 2022) vs. after (Class of 2024) these initiatives and of the applicant pool vs. admitted class were examined.</ab>
        <ab>For the Class of 2024, the percentage of admitted racialized students (55.2%), those with socioeconomic challenges (32.3%), and those from remote/rural/small town communities (18.6%) reflected applicant pool demographics (52.8, 29.9, and 17.2%, respectively). Additionally, 5.3% (vs. 5.6% applicant pool) of admitted students had applied through ACCESS. These data suggest that barriers within the admissions process for these URM populations were potentially mitigated by these initiatives. The initiatives broadly improved representation of racialized students, LGBTQ2S+, and those with disability with statistically significant increases in representation of those with socioeconomic challenges (32.3 vs. 19.3%, p = 0.04), and those with language diversity (42.1 vs. 35.0%, p = 0.04). Thus, these changes within the general MD admissions pathways will help diversify the future Canadian physician workforce and inform future initiatives to address health equity and social accountability within Canada.</ab>

        <ab>Promoting a diverse workforce of healthcare professionals that delivers equitable patient care is an important goal in oncology, as in all of medicine. While most medical schools have a diversity office and associated initiatives, little is known about radiation oncology (RO) department-level efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We describe the current state of DEI leadership and initiatives in RO departments in the US to guide future policies and programs.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 124 US RO departments affiliated with a medical school were contacted to identify departmental DEI leadership. Identified DEI leaders were asked to complete an anonymous survey assessing characteristics of their departmental DEI leadership, committee/organizational structure, activities, and perceived barriers to, and impact of, their work. Descriptive statistics are reported.</ab>
        <ab>Among 85 RO departments that responded (68.5% response rate), 48 (56.5%) reported having a departmental DEI leader. Thirty-four DEI leaders completed the survey (70.8%). Most DEI leaders were assistant or associate professors (n=28, 82.2%), women (n=25, 73.1%), and identified with at least one non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity (n=18, 53.6%). Nineteen (55.9%) had an associated departmental DEI committee; with 10 (52.6%) starting in 2020 or later. Few DEI leaders had administrative support (38.2%), funding (29.4%), protected time (23.5%), or increased compensation for added duties (23.5%). Seventeen (51.7%) believed their DEI-focused efforts were considered for promotion. The most reported initiatives included offering programming/education, supporting students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, improving recruitment practices/hiring, and implementing pipeline/pathway projects. The perceived impact of DEI initiatives included an increased culture of respect (89.7%), improved healthcare disparity awareness (75.9%), and improved systematic/structural racism awareness (79.3%).</ab>
        <ab>Departmental DEI efforts are increasingly common within RO, however, the structure, resources, and recognition associated with DEI work are variable. Additional dedicated resources and recognition for these efforts will help ensure a culture of inclusive excellence for the RO workforce and patients.</ab>

        <ab>While the number of positions, committees, and projects described as "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)" work has grown rapidly in recent years, there has been little attention to the theory, praxis, or lived experience of this work. In this perspective, we briefly summarize the research and concepts put forth by DEI leaders in higher education more broadly, followed by an analysis of the literature's application to academic medicine. We then discuss the ways in which language obscures the nature of DEI and the necessity of scholarship to evaluate the extensive range of practices, policies, statements, and programs the label is given to.</ab>

        <ab>During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVIDiSTRESS Consortium launched an open-access global survey to understand and improve individuals' experiences related to the crisis. A year later, we extended this line of research by launching a new survey to address the dynamic landscape of the pandemic. This survey was released with the goal of addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion by working with over 150 researchers across the globe who collected data in 48 languages and dialects across 137 countries. The resulting cleaned dataset described here includes 15,740 of over 20,000 responses. The dataset allows cross-cultural study of psychological wellbeing and behaviours a year into the pandemic. It includes measures of stress, resilience, vaccine attitudes, trust in government and scientists, compliance, and information acquisition and misperceptions regarding COVID-19. Open-access raw and cleaned datasets with computed scores are available. Just as our initial COVIDiSTRESS dataset has facilitated government policy decisions regarding health crises, this dataset can be used by researchers and policy makers to inform research, decisions, and policy.</ab>

        <ab>Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer generally have narrow therapeutic indices along with potentially serious adverse toxicities. Many cancer drugs are at least partially excreted through the kidney and, thus, the availability of accurate data on safe and effective dosing of these drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential to guide treatment decisions. Typically, during drug development, initial clinical studies only include patients with normal or only mildly impaired kidney function. In subsequent preregistration studies, a limited number of patients with more severe kidney dysfunction are included. Data obtained from patients with either severe kidney dysfunction (here defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 ml/min or stage 4G CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring kidney replacement treatment are particularly limited before drug registration and only a minority of new drug applications to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include data from this population. Unfortunately, limited data and/or other safety concerns may result in a manufacturer statement that the drug is contraindicated in patients with advanced kidney disease, which hinders access to potentially beneficial drugs for these patients. This systemic exclusion of patients with CKD from cancer drug trials remains an unsolved problem, which prevents provision of optimal clinical care for these patients, raises questions of inclusion, diversity, and equity. In addition, with the aging of the population, there are increasing numbers of patients with CKD and cancer who face these issues. In this review, we evaluate the scientific basis to exclude patients with CKD from cancer trials and propose a comprehensive strategy to address this problem.</ab>

        <ab>Historic science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplinary cultures were founded in a system that was predominately male, white, heterosexual, and able-bodied (i.e., "majority"). Some societal norms have changed, and so has demand for inclusive STEM engagement. However, legacy mental models, or deeply held beliefs and assumptions, linger and are embedded in the STEM system and disciplinary cultures. STEM reform is needed to maximize talent and create inclusive professions, but cannot be achieved without recognizing and addressing norms and practices that disproportionately serve majority vs. minoritized groups. As leading voices in disciplinary work and application, disciplinary and professional societies (Societies) are instrumental in shaping and sustaining STEM norms. We, leaders of the Amplifying the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success (ACCESS+) project, recognize the need to provide Society diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) change leaders with tools necessary to foster systemic change. In this Perspectives article, we present the Equity Environmental Scanning Tool (EEST) as an aid to help Society DEI change leaders elucidate legacy mental models, discern areas of strength, identify foci for advancement, and benchmark organizational change efforts. We share our rationale and work done to identify, and, ultimately, adapt a Society DEI self-assessment tool from the United Kingdom. We share background information on the UK tool, content and structural changes made to create the EEST, and an overview of the resulting EEST. Ultimately, we seek to increase awareness of a Society-specific DEI self-assessment tool designed to help Society DEI change leaders advance inclusive reform.</ab>

        <ab>The job placement of persons with disability is often threatened by prejudices and stereotypes; even when they are employed, they have less qualified and less paid jobs. The aim of this study was to investigate the self-perceived employability in a sample of workers with disability, hypothesizing to find a good level of self-determination and positive meaning of work.</ab>
        <ab>Ten semi-structured interviews have been conducted, applying a mix-method to the data analysis through qualitative interpretation and quantitative content analysis. Results confirmed what recent literature shows about the need for job inclusiveness for persons with disability and also underlined a profound sense of satisfaction related to the job, strong identity, and empowerment derived from the job involvement.</ab>
        <ab>Practical implications are related to the job design procedure inspired by diversity management, in order to pay attention to every single diversity and ensure equity and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</ab>

        <ab>A healthcare workforce that demonstrates cultural competence and humility while reflecting the diversity of the surrounding community has the potential to significantly benefit the patient population it serves. In this context and given numerous societal influences and the events of 2020, the leadership of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Albany Medical Center recognized the need to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in multiple areas. These included premedical education, medical education, postgraduate medical education, faculty development, staff satisfaction, and patient care. The department formed a DEI taskforce that developed an ongoing, multipronged, interdisciplinary approach to address these important aspects of our work and clinical environment with the goals of improving staff wellbeing, reducing burnout, and promoting the health of our community. Our experience is shared here to illustrate how a small, dedicated team can implement a variety of DEI initiatives quickly and with relatively little cost at a large academic medical center.</ab>

        <ab>In order to accurately detect and prevent racial disparities, self-reported race (SRR) and ethnicity remain valuable tools; however, inaccurate capture of patient identity and broad aggregation of minoritized race groups present challenges for data interpretation. Also, although SRR is a proxy for shared social/cultural experience, it is not an accurate representation of shared endogenous factors. Biological investigations into cancer disparities, particularly those involving genetic features, should be framed in the context of genetic background or ancestry, as these are heritable aspects of population health. In reality, both genetics and environment work in concert to influence cancer risk and clinical outcomes. The best opportunity to define actionable means for reducing health disparities is in rigorous and comprehensive generation of rich data sets that characterize environmental, biological, and genetic components of disparate disease burden. To translate this pivotal disparities research into clinical tools and improved policies, we describe a diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) framework, which will increase participation from diverse backgrounds, reexamine previous research with a rigorous evaluation of appropriate SRR groupings, and engage community leaders to ensure that future research addresses the needs of communities at increased risk. On this path forward, we may finally end cancer disparities.</ab>

        <ab>As the largest longitudinal study of adolescent brain development and behavior to date, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® has provided immense opportunities for researchers across disciplines since its first data release in 2018. The size and scope of the study also present a number of hurdles, which range from becoming familiar with the study design and data structure to employing rigorous and reproducible analyses. The current paper is intended as a guide for researchers and reviewers working with ABCD data, highlighting the features of the data (and the strengths and limitations therein) as well as relevant analytical and methodological considerations. Additionally, we explore justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts as they pertain to the ABCD Study and other large-scale datasets. In doing so, we hope to increase both accessibility of the ABCD Study and transparency within the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience.</ab>

        <ab>Trainees' value as effective leaders within academic medicine has been increasingly recognized. From their perspective as adult learners who enter medical education from diverse backgrounds, trainees offer significant value to the teaching, learning, and practice of medicine. As such, trainees have developed and led various successful initiatives throughout academic medicine. In this Invited Commentary, 2 medical students with national leadership roles provide their perspectives on how student-led initiatives and advocacy can help push academic medicine forward. The authors first provide an overview of the success of student-led initiatives throughout medical education as evidenced by the Trainee-Authored Letters to the Editor in this issue, highlighting the unique contributions and perspectives of trainees in the development and implementation of new initiatives or ways of thinking. Although trainees add value to many areas in academic medicine, here the authors highlight 4 current areas that align with Association of American Medical Colleges priorities: (1) public health emergencies including the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) equity, inclusion, and diversity; (3) wellness and resilience amongst trainees and health care providers; and (4) recent changes to the United States Medical Licensing Examination and the transition to residency. By sharing their experiences with student-led initiatives within each of these domains, the authors provide lessons learned and discuss successes and obstacles encountered along the way. Overall, there is a critical need for increased engagement of trainees in medical education. Empowering trainees now ensures the academic medicine leaders of tomorrow are prepared to face the challenges that await them.</ab>

        <ab>Disparities in salary and advancement of emergency medicine (EM) faculty by race and gender have been consistently demonstrated for over three decades. Prior studies have largely focused on individual-level solutions. To identify systems-based interventions, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) formed the Research Equity Task Force in 2018 with members from multiple academies (the Academy of Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine [AACEM], the Academy of Academic Administrators in Emergency Medicine [AAAEM], the Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine [AWAEM], and the Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine [ADIEM]) and sought recommendations from EM departmental leaders.</ab>
        <ab>The task force conducted interviews containing both open-ended narrative and closed-ended questions in multiple phases. Phase 1 included a convenience sample of chairs of EM departments across the United States, and phase 2 included vice-chairs and other faculty who lead promotion and advancement. The task force identified common themes from the interviews and then developed three-tiered sets of recommendations (minimal, target, and aspirational) based on participant responses. In phase 3, iterative feedback was collected and implemented on these recommendations from study participants and chairs participating in a national AACEM webinar.</ab>
        <ab>In findings from 53 interviews of chairs, vice-chairs, and faculty leaders from across the United States, we noted heterogeneity in the faculty development and promotion processes across institutions. Four main themes were identified from the interviews: the need for a directed, structured promotion process; provision of structured mentorship; clarity on requirements for promotion within tracks; and transparency in salary structure. Recommendations were developed to address gaps in structured mentorship and equitable promotion and compensation.</ab>
        <ab>These recommendations for AEM departments have the potential to increase structured mentorship programs, improve equity in promotion and advancement, and reduce disparities in the AEM workforce. These recommendations have been endorsed by SAEM, AACEM, AWAEM, ADIEM, and AAAEM.</ab>

        <ab>Despite the many challenges inherent in conducting high-quality evaluations in the field of environmental education (EE), there is a growing recognition of the importance of evaluation, not only to gauge program success, but also to use evaluation results to improve programming, support organizational learning, and ensure programs are meeting the needs of diverse audiences. The challenges to conducting high-quality evaluations are exacerbated by historical issues of inequity and systemic racism that are pervasive in the United States and globally. We reviewed the literature on culturally responsive approaches to evaluation to propose a culturally responsive evaluation framework and consider its application in EE. This framework helps EE organizations and evaluators consider how issues of race, power, privilege, and inequity influence the evaluation process and the validity of evaluation findings. Implementing this framework may be resource-intensive, but it has the potential to improve evaluation processes and produce actionable results to further address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of EE. We call for organizations that support EE efforts to recognize the importance of this approach, and provide adequate resources to encourage its implementation.</ab>

        <ab>A career in systems science offers exciting prospects as well as challenges around the world, which are often underexplored or unknown. Gender parity, diversity, inclusion, and equity are essential for knowledge production, systems science research, and innovation to be representative, democratic, and critically informed. By virtue of its focus on systems, omics science is ideally poised to understand and respond to systemic and structural issues that hinder gender parity, equity, and democracy in science and society. In this context, voices from women in systems science in resource-limited countries are often inaudible, a gap that this article aims to bridge. We present here some of the pressing issues and possible ways forward for equitable representation of women in science. We highlight emerging frontiers of systems science such as digital transformation, Industry 4.0, and cyber-physical systems where gender parity and equity are crucial. This article also examines some of the challenges faced by women scientists in Africa. All in all, much work is needed across communities and countries worldwide for diversity and gender equity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)-based programs. Adapting a critical lens that examines power asymmetries in STEM in Africa and around the world, and new ways of thinking for bringing women scientists in Africa to leadership positions in traditional STEM fields such as computer science and engineering where large gender equity gaps exist, is a timely and principled necessity in 21st century science and society.</ab>

        <ab>Long-standing challenges facing the mental health system require more effective strategies to furnish a workforce whose diversity matches an increasingly diverse population. Current and former system leaders can offer expert guidance informed by their experiences and perspectives. Their professional journeys to leadership in this area provide context and unique insight into issues of justice, including workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in psychiatry. These experts agree that significant policy changes are needed to improve psychiatric workforce diversity and that implementing change will require that disparate groups together to achieve this goal. Financial considerations must be included in policy and advocacy.</ab>

        <ab>Recent recognitions of longstanding societal effects of structural and overt acts of racism have led to calls for the elimination of race, a social construct, from medical algorithms. This accelerated a growing concern with the use of race in kidney function estimating equations. A task force sponsored by the two leading nephrology societies in the United States has reassessed the inclusion of race in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation and recently put forth recommendations. New race-free equations have been developed and guides for widespread implementation have been provided. We herein review the journey of kidney function estimating equations, race in GFR estimating equations, new race-free equations and the path forward in caring for chronic kidney disease. We urge upon all primary care providers to employ concerted focus on early detection and identification of kidney dysfunction as well as risk factors including social determinants of health to prevent progression.</ab>

        <ab>Efforts to make research environments more inclusive and diverse are beneficial for the next generation of Great Lakes researchers. The global COVID-19 pandemic introduced circumstances that forced graduate programs and academic institutions to re-evaluate and promptly pivot research traditions, such as weekly seminar series, which are critical training grounds and networking opportunities for early career researchers (ECRs). While several studies have established that academics with funded grants and robust networks were better able to weather the abrupt changes in research and closures of institutions, ECRs did not. In response, both existing and novel partnerships provided a resilient network to support ECRs at an essential stage of their career development. Considering these challenges, we sought to re-frame the seminar series as a virtual collaboration for ECRs. Two interdisciplinary graduate programs, located in different countries (Windsor, Canada, and Detroit, USA) invested in a year-long partnership to deliver a virtual-only seminar series that intentionally promoted: the co-creation of protocols and co-led roles, the amplification of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion throughout all aspects of organization and representation, engagement and amplification through social media, the integration of social, scientific and cultural research disciplines, all of which collectively showcased the capacity of our ECRs to lead, organize and communicate. This approach has great potential for application across different communities to learn through collaboration and sharing, and to empower the next generation to find new ways of working together.</ab>

        <ab>Educational institutions increasingly recognize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to combat and dismantle structures that sustain inequities. However, successful DEI work hinges on individuals being authentic allies and incorporating allyship into their professional development. Allyship involves members of dominant groups recognizing their privilege and engaging in actions to create inclusivity and equitable spaces for all. Individuals from dominant groups with desires to actively support others from marginalized groups are often unsure how to fight oppression and prejudice. Our goal as faculty with diverse perspectives and heterogeneous intersectional identities is to provide readers with the tools to develop as an authentic ally through educating themselves about the identities and experiences of others, challenging their own discomfort and prejudices, dedicating the time and patience to learning how to be an ally, and taking action to promote change toward personal, institutional, and societal justice and equality. Ultimately, each person must advocate for change because we all hold the responsibility. When everyone is an authentic ally, we all thrive and rise together.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the egregious disproportionate burden of disease based on race, ethnicity, and failure of organizations to address structural racism. This paper describes a journey by members of the National Academies of Practice (NAP) who came together to address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Through collaborative efforts, a virtual, interactive workshop was designed and delivered at NAP's 2021 Virtual Forum to facilitate discussions about DEI priorities across professions and to initiate a sustainable action plan toward achieving inclusive excellence. Resulting discoveries and reflections led us to the essential question: can we truly become an anti-racist interprofessional healthcare organization?</ab>

Sexual minorities (ie, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual [LGBTQIA] communities) face many challenges in society and the workplace, including mental health conditions, discrimination, and increased risk for burnout. In this review, we outline the current state of mental health conditions and burnout in sexual minority individuals, discrimination and harassment faced both in society and the workplace, and steps that workplaces can take to become more inclusive and welcoming.</ab>

        <ab>Our annual coeditors' retreat is a time to step back from the words on the page and reflect on our values for this work. Our values set the course for goals and subsequent actions for the year. In our 3 days away from the office to focus on the journal, we have the quiet space to set intentions. Then, we set timelines, we send emails, we put things in motion. We came to this year's retreat prepared to consider a critical topic: equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). That Families, Systems, &amp; Health (FSH) recruit, welcome, review, and publish science that is representative of the widest range of experience and perspective is a core value for us as coeditors. We feel we have a moral and ethical obligation as leaders, scientists, and humans, to pursue social justice and equitable health outcomes for all. Such efforts are needed to help rectify the longstanding history of systemic racism and discrimination against minoritized communities that continues even today. In the context of recent events including protests against racial injustices as well as health disparities experienced by people of color during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the scientific community is realizing we can no longer remain bystanders. Our role as coeditors of a journal affords the opportunity to support equitable and inclusive practices representing a diverse array of individuals and communities throughout the peer review and publication process, which not only enhances equity but also improves science. In exploratory conversations with our leadership team (i.e., coeditors, associate editors, and department editors) and editorial board, we knew that all of us were of a mind in our values and aspirations to improve EDI in FSH. We write this editorial to transparently communicate in a way that provides context for recent and upcoming changes in journal processes designed to support EDI. We want to clearly state our intentions to work on improving EDI throughout all aspects of FSH. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).</ab>

        <ab>This second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research across the translational spectrum focuses on study design factors. Although objectivity is a cornerstone value of science, subjectivity is embedded in every step of the research process as investigators make choices about who they collaborate with, which research questions they ask, how they recruit participants, which research tools they use, and how they analyze and interpret data. We present theory and evidence from disciplines such as sociology, medical anthropology, statistics, and public health to discuss 4 common study design factors, including 1) the dominant biomedical narrative of pain that restricts funding and exploration of social indicators of pain, 2) low diversity and inclusion in pain research enrollment that restricts generalizability to racialized groups, 3) the use of "race" or "ethnicity" as a statistical variable and proxy for lived experiences (eg, racism, resilience), and 4) limited modeling in preclinical research for the impact of social factors on pain physiology. The information presented in this article is intended to start conversations across stakeholders in the pain field to explore how we can come together to adopt antiracism practices in our work at large to achieve equity for racialized groups. PERSPECTIVE: This is the second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research. This part identifies common study design factors that risk hindering progress toward pain care equity. We suggest reframes using an antiracism framework for these factors to encourage all pain investigators to collectively make strides toward equity.</ab>

        <ab>Academic medical centers striving to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and antiracism initiatives often ask faculty to volunteer substantial time to committee work, recruitment, mentoring, community, and administrative responsibilities. These requests are not in lieu of current workload and seldom count toward scholarship; the service may go unrecognized, unrewarded, and uncompensated. URiM faculty (underrepresented in medicine) providing such service thus pay a minority tax when precious time is syphoned away from career-advancing activities and personal growth. The resulting strain on available resources has social, psychological, and monetary ramifications that can undermine the long-term objectives of DEI initiatives. We examine the facets of the minority tax, consider the current state of diversity, and present a roadmap to redistribute, reform, and reduce URiM taxation through shared engagement in DEI initiatives. Key interventions include ascribing value to DEI efforts, implementing evidence-based policies to reduce bias, and promoting mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship.</ab>

        <ab>Genetic counselors, like many other healthcare providers, play a vital role in genomic health care. As a profession, we, along with our colleagues and students, have recognized the need to improve and incorporate diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) within our daily ways of practice to help create access to genomic technologies. In order to create systemic change and focus on unity, open communication, and transparency, we introduce a suggested framework called ERA (Education, Recruitment, Retainment, Research, and Active Outreach). This framework would benefit a genetic counselor throughout various stages of their career, from student to practicing genetic counselor, and can be broadly applied to all specialties of genomic medicine. Different iterations of DEIJ efforts have arisen in the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), from the D&amp;I (Diversity and Inclusion) Task Force to the J.E.D.I (justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion) committee. The lack of recorded history of these previous efforts and the lack of communication between current DEIJ organizations is one of the many reasons the ERA framework demands unity and transparency to achieve sustainable positive change. Genetic counselors must unite and work collaboratively to conduct and promote DEIJ efforts, so the benefits of genomic medicine can be realized by all.</ab>

        <ab>In addition to formal training, informal training often occurs through a hidden curriculum. As the hidden curriculum shapes the knowledge and values held by learners, we must consider its role in implicit bias. One example is through the selection of images used in formal instruction. This study aimed to examine the representation of sex and race among images in two textbooks in emergency medicine (EM).</ab>
        <ab>We performed a cross-sectional study of the sex and race representation of figures in Rosen's Emergency Medicine : Concepts and Clinical Practice 9th Edition and Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine : A Comprehensive Study Guide 9th Edition . Two reviewers screened all images for inclusion, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Images were excluded if they did not include visualized skin. Two reviewers independently reviewed each image and assessed the sex, race, and roles in the image. A third reviewer resolved any disagreements.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 959 images (Rosen's n  = 377; Tintinalli's n  = 582) met inclusion criteria. Race was estimated in 877 cases (91.3%). Of those, White individuals comprised 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.0%-80.2%). Sex was estimated in 362 cases (37.7%). Of those images, males comprised 70.2% (95% CI 65.4%-74.9%), and females comprised 29.8% (95% CI 25.1%-34.6%).</ab>
        <ab>There is a male sex and White race predominance in visual representation among two EM textbooks. We propose a call to action for the mindful selection of images in formal education to represent diversity, equity, and inclusion and close the gap between the formal and hidden curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>The authors have no potential conflicts to disclose.</ab>

        <ab>There is increasing evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the evaluation and treatment of people with psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis, and inadequate racial/ethnic diversity in psoriatic disease (PsD) research. At the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2021 annual meeting, a program focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was presented to highlight known health and healthcare disparities in PsD. There is limited understanding of the prevalence and severity of PsD and how it affects quality of life among racial/ethnic minorities with PsD. Educational gaps and lack of diversity in our dermatology workforce may be contributing to challenges in appropriately diagnosing and treating PsO in darker skin types. Racial/ethnic minorities are also inadequately represented in clinical research, including trial recruitment and participation, for PsD. A panel of patient research partners, researchers, and clinicians ended the session with a broad discussion on how GRAPPA can better ensure racial/ethnic DEI in their educational, research, and clinical missions.</ab>

        <ab>'Fit' refers to an applicants' perceived compatibility to a residency programme. A variety of structural, identity-related and relational factors contribute to self-assessments of fit. The 2021 residency recruitment cycle in the USA was performed virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about how video-interviewing may affect residency applicants' ability to gauge fit.</ab>
        <ab>A multidisciplinary, anonymous survey was distributed to applicants at a large academic institution between rank order list (ROL) certification deadline and Match Day 2021. Using Likert-type scales, applicants rated factors for importance to 'fit' and their ease of assessment through video-interviewing. Applicants also self-assigned fit scores to the top-ranked programme in their ROL using Likert-type scales with pairs of anchoring statements.</ab>
        <ab>Four hundred seventy-three applicants responded to the survey (25.7% response rate). The three most important factors to applicants for assessment of fit (how much the programme seemed to care, how satisfied residents seem with their programme and how well the residents get along) were also the factors with the greatest discrepancy between importance and ease of assessment through video-interviewing. Diversity-related factors were more important to female applicants compared with males and to non-White applicants compared with White applicants. Furthermore, White male applicants self-assigned higher fit scores compared with other demographic groups.</ab>
        <ab>There is a marked discrepancy between the most important factors to applicants for fit and their ability to assess those factors virtually. Minoritised trainees self-assigned lower fit scores to their top-ranked programme, which should raise concern amongst medical educators and highlights the importance of expanding current diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the medical workforce is linked to improved patient care and innovation, as well as employee retention and engagement. The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology launched a survey to provide a benchmark of DEI and engagement among radiation oncology (RO) professionals in Europe.</ab>
        <ab>An anonymous survey was disseminated among RO professionals in Europe. The survey collected demographics and professional information, and participants were asked if they felt they belonged to a minority group. A DEI and workforce engagement questionnaire by Person et al. evaluated 8 inclusion factors. A favourable score was calculated by adding the percentage of "strongly agreed" or "agreed" answers.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 812 complete responses were received from 35 European countries. 21% of respondents felt they belonged to a minority group, mostly based on race/ethnicity (5.9%), nationality (4.8%) and age (4.3%). Compared to benchmark data from the United States, scores were lower for most inclusion factors, and to a greater extent for minority groups. The overall favourable score was 58% for those belonging to a minority group, significantly lower than for other respondents (71%, p &lt; 0.001). Those belonging to a minority group because of their gender or age had the lowest overall favourable score (47% and 51% respectively).</ab>
        <ab>Our work indicates that actions to improve DEI and workforce engagement among RO professionals in Europe are urgently needed, in particular among minority groups. This would potentially improve employee wellbeing and retention, promoting high quality care and innovation.</ab>

        <ab>The Centralized Otolaryngology Research Efforts (CORE) grant program coordinates research funding initiatives across the subspecialties of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Modeled after National Institutes of Health study sections, CORE grant review processes provide comprehensive reviews of scientific proposals. The organizational structure and grant review process support grant-writing skills, attention to study design, and other components of academic maturation toward securing external grants from the National Institutes of Health or other agencies. As a learning community and a catalyst for scientific advances, CORE evaluates clinical, translational, basic science, and health services research. Amid the societal reckoning around long-standing social injustices and health inequities, an important question is to what extent CORE engenders diversity, equity, and inclusion for the otolaryngology workforce. This commentary explores CORE's track record as a stepping-stone for promoting equity and innovation in the specialty. Such insights can help maximize opportunities for cultivating diverse leaders across the career continuum.</ab>

        <ab>Documented disparities have profoundly impacted the training and careers of physicians from socially and historically marginalized groups, including women, people with disabilities, people who identify with racial and ethnic minority groups, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning+ community. Professionalism is a core component of medical training and practice, yet a focus on workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion is often absent. This report aims to encourage the adoption of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion as a crucial component of professionalism, with an emphasis on the field of psychiatry.</ab>

        <ab>Background: Outdated gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) information practices in health care contribute to health inequities for sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. Objective: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. Results: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. Conclusions: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency. Modern GSSO information practices depend on and reinforce SGM competency in health care. JMIR Med Inform 2021;9(2):e25467 doi:10.2196/25467</ab>

        <ab>The Association for Multidisciplinary Education and Research in Substance Use and Addiction (AMERSA) acknowledges that racism profoundly affects persons who use alcohol and other drugs. Racism's deadly effects compounded with other social determinants of health result in a cascade of negative impacts. The AMERSA Board of Directors (BOD) proposes an initial set of strategies to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion using a framework that speaks to four key AMERSA experiences: engagement, education, mentorship, and leadership. Through these strategies, AMERSA commits to promoting equity and inclusion to dismantle the individual, institutional, and structural racism that has permeated the United States for centuries.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the study is to contribute to the "well-being, diversity, equity, and inclusion" dialogue of the post-pandemic era. Specifically, we explored the joint effects of biological sex and gender diversity in self-identity on the role demands-work and family conflict relationships. To advance the inclusion of scientific knowledge, the present study was conducted in the cultural context of a Chinese society. We surveyed a sample of 317 Taiwanese employees. We used structured questionnaires to collect data on biological sex, gender identity (self-endorsement on masculinity and femininity traits), work and family demands, work-to-family conflict (WFC), and family-to-work conflict (FWC). We found two sets of significant three-way interactions (sex × femininity × role demands) in predicting work and family conflict. First, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the positive relationship between work demands and FWC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Second, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the relationship between family demands and WFC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Our findings highlight the importance of jointly examining the biological, psychological, and social aspects of gender on the work and family interface. Contextualizing in an Eastern cultural tradition, we put the spotlight on societal pressure on people of nontraditional gender identities.</ab>

        <ab>The accreditation of medical educational programs is thought to be important in supporting program improvement, ensuring the quality of the education, and promoting diversity, equity, and population health. It has long been recognized that accreditation systems will need to shift their focus from processes to outcomes, particularly those related to the end goals of medical education: the creation of broadly competent, confident professionals and the improvement of health for individuals and populations. An international group of experts in accreditation convened in 2013 to discuss this shift.</ab>
        <ab>Participants unequivocally supported the inclusion of more outcomes-based criteria in medical education accreditation, specifically those related to the societal accountability of the institutions in which the education occurs. Meaningful and feasible outcome metrics, however, are hard to identify. They are regionally variable, often temporally remote from the educational program, difficult to measure, and susceptible to confounding factors. The group identified the importance of health outcomes of the clinical milieu in which education takes place in influencing outcomes of its graduates. The ability to link clinical data with individual practice over time is becoming feasible with large repositories of assessment data linked to patient outcomes. This was seen as a key opportunity to provide more continuous oversight and monitoring of program impact. The discussants identified several risks that might arise should outcomes measures completely replace process issues. Some outcomes can be measured only by proxy process elements, and some learner experience issues may best be measured by such process elements: in brief, the "how" still matters.</ab>
        <ab>Accrediting bodies are beginning to view the use of practice outcome measures as an important step toward better continuous educational quality improvement. The use of outcomes will present challenges in data collection, aggregation, and interpretation. Large datasets that capture clinical outcomes, experience of care, and health system performance may enable the assessment of multiple dimensions of program quality, assure the public that the social contract is being upheld, and allow identification of exemplary programs such that all may improve. There remains a need to retain some focus on process, particularly those related to the learner experience.</ab>

        <ab>In 2018, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education(ACGME)updated its Common Program Requirements to include training in caring for diverse populations and understanding social determinants of health. In our large pediatric residency program, we implemented a formal equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) curriculum in 2018 after a needs assessment. The curriculum includes monthly didactic sessions and two half- day skill-building sessions on EDI fundamentals and responding to microaggressions. Objective: To describe how curriculum implementation changed residents self-perceived knowledge, attitudes and behaviors when delivering patient care to diverse patient populations. Two focus groups (n=13) were conducted by trained facilitators with senior pediatric residents using a structured question guide. Written notes and audio transcripts were recorded. Four project members coded the notes and transcripts using a codebook. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The full project team reviewed and discussed common themes. Of the 13 residents, 61% (8/13) were R2s. 31% (4/13) were residents of color and 77% (10/13) were female. Four major themes were identified (Table 1. First, residents described a sense of importance and empowerment to engage in EDI issues after the curriculum. Second, residents reported gaining specific skills to recognize and address microaggressions. Third, residents described attitude and behavior shifts from increased awareness of biases in patient care. The fourth theme was a limitation in providing equitable care due to availability and appropriate use of interpreters. Pediatric residents reported increased awareness and improved skills when providing care to diverse populations after implementation of an EDI curriculum. Residents described how this curriculum provided language to properly recognize and address witnessed inequities. Next steps in curricular efforts include a follow-up quantitative survey of all residents, focus groups with interns and direct observation of resident behaviors to assess impact.</ab>

        <ab>Medicine's social mandate recognizes the importance of introducing changes to systems and practices to meet the healthcare needs of marginalized populations. Social accountability efforts encompass a wide array of actions, including equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and adapting knowledge relevant to practice across education, research, and clinical domains. To influence change in education, ongoing structures and processes are needed to ensure adequacy, relevance, and effectiveness of curricular coverage. In support of this, we created an innovative and creative approach to developing curricular modules to prepare medical students to provide care that is responsive to the cultural, economic, and psychosocial realities of diverse patient populations. The DISCuSS model (Diversity, Identify, Search, Create module (with community engagement), Sustainability, Social accountability) provides a community-engaged, iterative approach to curriculum development relevant to social accountability. Over the past 5 years, we have created nine curricular modules focused on health-related inequities and social concerns, including modules on Indigenous and refugee health, sexual and gender minority health, human trafficking, and addiction. AFMC Graduation Questionnaire results have shown a statistically significant increase in our students 'preparedness to provide care to diverse populations.' The DISCuSS model, which continues to evolve, can be adapted and used in other settings.</ab>

        <ab>Advancing equality and equity in society is creating positive change, and the time has come to critically evaluate veterinary medicine, which, by all metrics, lacks diversity. To keep pace with increasingly diverse demographics and recent surges in pet ownership among all racial/ethnic groups, significant efforts to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) must occur in veterinary colleges and the profession. Recruiting more underrepresented students, building pipelines for diverse faculty/staff, and creating inclusive, welcoming environments where all can thrive are critical steps toward enhancing DEIB within our organizations and profession. Our goal is to share experiences and lessons learned from our intentional commitment to strengthen DEIB, with the hope that our journey will be helpful to others. Increasing diversity in the veterinary profession will be facilitated through removing barriers, creating inclusive work environments where all people feel they belong, and ensuring fair and equitable hiring and personnel management practices. These steps should in turn improve access and quality of veterinary care, ensure we are more representative of the communities we serve, increase revenue, and preserve the human-animal bond. "You cannot change any society unless you take responsibility for it, unless you see yourself belonging to it, and responsible for changing it." - Grace Lee Boggs.</ab>

        <ab>            Problem          :Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) trainings for medical school faculty often lack self-reflective and pedagogically focused components that may promote incorporation of anti-racism and social justice into medical school curricula.             Intervention          : A four-session Narrative Medicine (NM) anti-racism program was designed for medical school faculty using critical race theory, phenomenology, and NM methods. Each workshop consisted of a lecture on key NM concepts and a small-group breakout session incorporating group discussion, close reading, and reflective writing.             Context          : This NM anti-racism program was developed and implemented in April 2021 by two medical students for faculty at an institution in the southeastern U.S. The program was supported by the Office of Inclusive Excellence at the institution and held in collaboration with the institution's medical education teaching academy. Program evaluation consisted of pre- and post-program surveys, which queried participants' previous experiences with DEI and medical humanities programs, perceptions of self-identity and privilege, and confidence in teaching concepts of anti-racism. Of the total program participants (n = 32), 19 completed both surveys (54.3%). Survey data were analyzed using bivariate testing methods and qualitative thematic analysis.             Impact          : Post-program surveys showed 13 (68.4%) participants felt "somewhat more" or "more" comfortable engaging in concepts of race, and 12 (63.2%) participants felt "somewhat more" or "more" comfortable including topics of race into their teaching compared to before the program. Five themes were generated following qualitative analysis: (1) the value of longitudinal narrative reflection in a small-group setting for DEI work; (2) desire to commit more time to DEI, anti-racist, and social justice work while balancing busy teaching and clinical schedules; (3) the value of storytelling in DEI and anti-racism programming; (4) an understanding of deconstructive and reconstructive work of anti-racism in medicine; and (5) an increased ability to educate and enact change through teaching, activism, and institutional cultural and policy changes.             Lessons Learned          : This novel NM DEI training for medical school faculty was successful in increasing comfort discussing and teaching concepts of race in the medical school classroom, while providing a uniquely reflective space for personal growth. Participation in this longitudinal reflective experience was limited by physician schedules, therefore efforts to make time to participate in similar longitudinal interventions must be undertaken.</ab>

        <ab>The United States has long made substantial investments in clinical research with the goal of improving the health and well-being of our nation. There is no doubt that these investments have contributed significantly to treating and preventing disease and extending human life. Nevertheless, clinical research faces a critical shortcoming. Currently, large swaths of the U.S. population, and those that often face the greatest health challenges, are less able to benefit from these discoveries because they are not adequately represented in clinical research studies. While progress has been made with representation of white women in clinical trials and clinical research, there has been little progress in the last three decades to increase participation of racial and ethnic minority population groups. This underrepresentation is compounding health disparities, with serious consequences for underrepresented groups and for the nation. At the request of Congress, Improving Representation in Clinical Trials and Research: Building Research Equity for Women and Underrepresented Groups identifies policies, procedures, programs, or projects aimed at increasing the inclusion of these groups in clinical research and the specific strategies used by those conducting clinical trials and clinical and translational research to improve diversity and inclusion. This report models the potential economic benefits of full inclusion of men, women, and racial and ethnic groups in clinical research and highlights new programs and interventions in medical centers and other clinical settings designed to increase participation.</ab>

        <ab>The National Football League (NFL) and its teams, some of the world's most profitable sporting properties, face challenges with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). With a history of discriminatory work environments, including a recent high-profile lawsuit, the NFL and its teams have a poor reputation on these issues. This perspective piece investigated NFL teams' utilization of organization employees dedicated to DEI. Utilizing a content analysis of publicly available data, this piece investigated DEI employees at NFL team organizations. The study analyzed the position's characteristics including the name of the role, the department in which it was housed, and the reporting structure. The study also examined the demographics and professional background of the employees in the roles. The findings conclude that NFL teams lag behind other American businesses in their adoption of Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) roles. As of 2022, only 31.25% of NFL teams had a dedicated DEI staff person. Three additional teams host diversity councils utilizing employees with other job responsibilities. The employees filling the CDO roles were majority women and majority Black. Though not the only answer to a complex problem, in order to address these challenges and move forward, the NFL teams should create Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) roles. These positions should have appropriate reporting relationships, well-crafted position responsibilities, generous resources, and qualified and experienced employees.</ab>

        <ab>The Coalition for Physician Accountability's Undergraduate Medical Education-Graduate Medical Education (UME-GME) Review Committee (UGRC): Recommendations for Comprehensive Improvement of the UME-GME Transition final report includes a total of 34 recommendations and outlines opportunities to transform the current processes of learner transition from a US-based MD- or DO-granting medical school or international medical education pathway into residency training in the United States. This review provides a reflection on the recommendations from the authors, all members of the UGRC, describing the pros and cons and the opportunities and limitations, in the hopes that they might inspire readers to dig deeper into the report and contribute to meaningful improvements to the current transition. The UGRC Recommendations highlight the many opportunities for improvement in the UME-to-GME transition. They are built on the connection to the system of education and formation of physicians to a more just healthcare system, with attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion to improve health disparities and to the quality of care that patients receive. However, there are justifiable concerns about changes that are not fully understood or that could potentially lead to unintentional consequences. This analysis, reached through author consensus, considers the pros and cons in the potential application of the UGRC Recommendations to improve the UME-to-GME transition. Further debate and discussion are warranted, without undue delay, all with the intention to continue to improve the education of tomorrow's physicians and the care for the patients who we have the privilege to serve.</ab>

        <ab>Advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in emergency medicine can only occur with intentional recruitment of residency applicants underrepresented in medicine (UIM). Shared experiences from undergraduate and graduate medical education highlight considerations and practices that can contribute to improved diversity in the resident pool, such as holistic review and mitigating bias in the recruitment process. This review, written by members of the Council of Residency Directors in Emergency Medicine (CORD) Best Practices Subcommittee, offers best practice recommendations for the recruitment of UIM applicants. Recommendations address pre-interview readiness, interview approach, and post-interview strategies that residency leadership may use to implement holistic review and mitigate bias for recruitment of a diverse class.</ab>

        <ab>Successful strategies to improve the representation of female and ethnically underrepresented in medicine (UIM) physicians among US plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS) faculty have not been adequately explored. Accordingly, we aimed to identify programs that have had success, and in parallel gather PRS program directors' and chiefs/chairs' perspectives on diversity recruitment intentionality and strategies.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the demographic composition of female and UIM faculty of PRS residency training programs. Separate lists of programs in the top quartile for female and UIM faculty representation were collated. Additionally, a 14-question survey was administered to program directors and chiefs/chairs of all 99 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited PRS residency programs. The questions comprised three domains: (1) demographic information; (2) perceptions about diversity; and (3) recruitment strategies utilized to diversify faculty.</ab>
        <ab>Female and UIM faculty representation ranged from 0% to 63% and 0% to 50%, respectively. Survey responses were received from program directors and chiefs/chairs of 55 institutions (55% response rate). Twenty-five (43%) respondents felt their program was diverse. Fifty-one (80%) respondents felt diversity was important to the composition of PRS faculty. Active recruitment of diverse faculty and the implementation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion committee were among the most frequently cited strategies to establish a culturally sensitive and inclusive environment.</ab>
        <ab>These findings reveal that female and UIM representation among US PRS faculty remains insufficient; however, some programs have had success through deliberate and intentional implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic and calls for racial justice have highlighted the need for schools to promote social mission. Measuring social mission engagement and performance in health professions education may encourage institutional efforts to advance health equity and social justice commitments.</ab>
        <ab>To describe the current state of social mission commitment within dental, medical, and nursing schools in the US and to examine how social mission performance compares across school types.</ab>
        <ab>This cross-sectional survey study invited all US dental and medical schools and a subset of baccalaureate- and master's degree-conferring nursing schools to participate in a self-assessment to measure their school's social mission commitment from January 29 through October 9, 2019. The survey measured 79 indicators (with indicators defined as responses to specific scored questions that indicated the state or level of social mission commitment) across 18 areas in 6 domains of school functioning (educational program, community engagement, governance, diversity and inclusion, institutional culture and climate, and research) that have potential to enhance social mission engagement and performance. Individual health professions schools were the unit of analysis, and 689 dental, medical, and nursing schools were invited to participate. School deans and program directors were the primary target respondents because of their broad insight into their school's programs and policies and their ability to request data from various internal sources. Demographic information from respondents was not collected because multiple respondents from an institution could complete different sections of the survey.</ab>
        <ab>Survey responses were analyzed to create indicator scores, standardized area scores, and an overall social mission score for each school. Using descriptive analyses, frequency and contingency tables of specific indicators within each area were created, and schools were compared based on ownership status (private or public), Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education research classification group (doctoral university with very high research activity [R1], doctoral university with high [R2] or moderate [R3] research activity, baccalaureate or master's nursing college or university, or special focus institution), and discipline group (dental school, medical school granting doctor of osteopathic medicine [DO] degrees, medical school granting doctor of medicine [MD] degrees, nursing school granting baccalaureate-level degrees, or nursing school granting master's-level degrees).</ab>
        <ab>Among 689 invited schools, 242 schools (35.1%) completed the self-assessment survey. Of those, 133 (55.0%) were nursing schools, 83 (34.3%) were medical schools, and 26 (10.7%) were dental schools. Response rates ranged from 133 of 420 invited nursing schools (31.7%) to 83 of 203 invited medical schools (40.9%). Most schools included social determinants of health in their curriculum in either required courses (233 of 242 schools [96.3%]) or elective courses (4 of 242 schools [1.7%]), but only 116 of 235 schools (49.4%) integrated social determinants of health across all years of study. Most schools also included health disparities in either their required courses (232 of 242 [95.9%]) or elective courses (6 of 242 [2.5%]); however, only 118 of 235 schools (50.2%) integrated health disparities across all years of study. In several areas of social mission, public schools performed better than private schools (eg, curriculum: mean [SE] standardized area score, 0.13 [0.07] points vs -0.14 [0.09] points, respectively), and R1 doctoral universities and special focus institutions performed better than R2 and R3 doctoral universities and baccalaureate and master's nursing colleges and universities (eg, extracurricular activities: mean [SE] standardized area score, 0.25 [0.09] points for R1 doctoral universities and 0.20 [0.12] points for special focus institutions vs -0.05 [0.12] points for R2 and R3 doctoral universities and - 0.30 [0.12] points for baccalaureate and master's nursing colleges and universities. Different areas of strength emerged for dental, medical, and nursing schools. For example, in the curriculum area, MD-granting medical schools had a mean (SE) standardized area score of 0.38 (0.08) points, which was significantly higher than the standardized area scores of dental schools (mean [SE], -0.21 [0.14] points), DO-granting medical schools (mean [SE], -0.22 [0.13] points), graduate nursing schools (mean [SE], -0.21 [0.19] points), and undergraduate nursing schools (mean [SE], -0.05 [0.10] points).</ab>
        <ab>In this study, there was widespread interest from health professions educational leaders in understanding and enhancing social mission commitment. Future work may focus on identifying and promoting best practices using the framework described, providing schools with continued opportunities for self-assessment, and further validating the self-assessment survey.</ab>

        <ab>Despite progress in developing learning health systems (LHS) and associated metrics of success, a gap remains in identifying measures to guide the implementation and assessment of the impact of an oncology LHS. Our aim was to identify a balanced set of measures to guide a person-centered oncology LHS.</ab>
        <ab>A modified Delphi process and clinical value compass framework were used to prioritize measures for tracking LHS performance. A multidisciplinary group of 77 stakeholders, including people with cancer and family members, participated in 3 rounds of online voting followed by 50-minute discussions. Participants rated metrics on perceived importance to the LHS and discussed priorities.</ab>
        <ab>Voting was completed by 94% of participants and prioritized 22 measures within 8 domains. Patient and caregiver factors included clinical health (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, survival by cancer type and stage), functional health and quality of life (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Global-10, Distress Thermometer, Modified Caregiver Strain Index), experience of care (advance care planning, collaboRATE, PROMIS Self-Efficacy Scale, access to care, experience of care, end-of-life quality measures), and cost and resource use (avoidance and delay in accessing care and medications, financial hardship, total cost of care). Contextual factors included team well-being (Well-being Index; voluntary staff turnover); learning culture (Improvement Readiness, compliance with Commission on Cancer quality of care measures); scholarly engagement and productivity (institutional commitment and support for research, academic productivity index); and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (screening and follow-up for social determinants of health, inclusivity of staff and patients).</ab>
        <ab>The person-centered LHS value compass provides a balanced set of measures that oncology practices can use to monitor and evaluate improvement across multiple domains.</ab>

        <ab>Dental schools can support diversity and inclusion efforts through curricula targeted at providing a safe space for students to learn from each other and about themselves. Opportunities to learn about different backgrounds can improve levels of cultural sensitivity and improve inclusion. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of a diversity dialogue tool for second-year dental students and evaluate student responses to this activity.</ab>
        <ab>Following a 3-h small group diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) dialogue, students completed a 3-2-1 reflective activity to determine new ideas that they encountered, ideas they would like to try, and things that they would like to know more about.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 66 students that participated in the DEI dialogue, 44 participated in the reflective activity for a response rate of 66%. Four significant new ideas were encountered including the concept of intersectionality (25%), the effects of race, racism, and identity on health (20.5), how to react to bias or discrimination (20.5%), and identity and their effect on perceptions of health and wellness (15.9). Three ideas students might try included being more open to learning about others' identity (52.3%), communicating openly with patients and peers (34.1%), and communicating calmly when dealing with bias or discrimination (13.6%). Two things students would like to know more about included how to handle situations of discrimination and bias (27.3%) and the existence of health disparities and how to address them (15.9%).</ab>
        <ab>Creating an opportunity for a DEI dialogue led to students encountering new information (intersectionality; effect of bias on health), identified targeted areas of future behavioral change (open and calm communication with others), and provided insight into areas of student interest (dealing with bias and addressing health disparities).</ab>

        <ab>Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) have become essential considerations in different academic fields in recent years, attracting an increasing number of voices and perspectives from different groups. There is a need for an intersectionality framework that is inclusive of both the local and global diversity of researchers. Here, we present an intersectionality framework called KLOB which structures barriers to academic success into four components: knowledge exchange (K), language (L), obligations (O), and biases (B), and thus helps to think about the cumulative effect of multiple barriers that individuals from different backgrounds encounter to succeed in academic activities such as scientific publishing, which is the primary currency of academic success in our current system. This framework highlights both local and global disparities in socioeconomic, linguistic, and discriminatory factors that determine the opportunity of individual researchers to succeed in academia. We emphasise that individual researchers have no control over most barriers they face because of where and how they were born. Implementing solutions to address barriers associated with KLOB requires a multiscale vision and initiatives that tackle local and global inequities.</ab>

        <ab>The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the significant inequities in the delivery of healthcare, vaccine inequity, and differential access to life-saving treatments, which have disproportionately impacted marginalized and racialized populations. In this article, we acknowledge and recognize the centuries-old legacies perpetuating inequity, injustice, and oppression, we discuss the principles of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) and we call our Canadian plastic surgery colleagues and trainees to action. We propose a plan for (1) Education, (2) Mitigating Disparities in the Clinical Setting, and (3) Policy, Societies, and Leadership Education.</ab>

        <ab>Issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in cardiothoracic surgery have garnered increased attention. Although barriers persist for women in our field, they may be ameliorated through enhanced support from allies. We aimed to determine best practices for allyship to better support female cardiothoracic surgeons.</ab>
        <ab>A survey was electronically distributed to members of Women in Thoracic Surgery, addressing presence of female colleagues, sense of allyship among colleagues and leadership, and supportive versus detrimental characteristics of colleagues. Qualitative responses were grouped and coded to identify key themes.</ab>
        <ab>Of 309 Women in Thoracic Surgery members, 87 (28%) responded. More than half of respondents felt supported by their male colleagues in the areas of clinical practice, research, teaching, and personal life. Whereas 64% of respondents considered at least one woman in their division an ally, only 48% considered at least one man in their division an ally, and 53% considered their division chief or department chair an ally. A theme of mentorship, support, and sponsorship was reported as the most important quality of allies, regardless of gender. A theme of disrespect, discrimination, stereotyping, and unconscious bias was reported as the most detrimental characteristic of male colleagues, whereas a theme of competitiveness and undermining was reported as the most detrimental of female colleagues. Initiatives to enhance support for female cardiothoracic surgeons were identified, with increased access to mentorship and sponsorship consistently identified as an important endeavor.</ab>
        <ab>Increasing access to mentors, promoting positive behavior, and minimizing detrimental behavior may enhance support for female cardiothoracic surgeons.</ab>

        <ab>Cited studies were reviewed using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria focused on United States literature to allow for demographic comparison with census data. To compare the racial representation in a study to the diversity in the surrounding city, we calculated the differences between county census data and the study race reported data and performed regression analyses.</ab>
        <ab>Eighty-seven cited studies were reviewed, of which 33 were excluded and 52 studies were further evaluated. Seventeen studies were US studies, nine of which reported race. Eighty percent of the women included in the 9 studies were non-Hispanic white women. A diverse geographic region did not correlate with increased study enrollment of non-White patients.</ab>
        <ab>The majority of cited studies used to develop the stress urinary incontinence management guidelines did not report the race/ethnicity of participants. Among those studies that did, Asian, Black, and Hispanic women were included at lower rates than non-Hispanic white women, identifying an area of opportunity to improve research recruitment and promote health equity. Non-Hispanic women were consistently overrepresented while other women were either under-represented or completely excluded.</ab>

        <ab>In May 2020, the Coalition for Physician Accountability's Work Group on Medical Students in the Class of 2021 Moving Across Institutions for Post Graduate Training (WG) released its final report and recommendations. These recommendations pertain to away rotations, virtual interviews, Electronic Residency Application Service opening for programs and the overall residency timeline, and general communications and attempt to provide clarity and level the playing field during the 2020-2021 residency application cycle. The WG's aims include promoting professional accountability by improving the quality, efficiency, and continuity of the education, training, and assessment of physicians. The authors argue the first 3 WG recommendations may disproportionately impact candidates from historically excluded and underrepresented groups in medicine (HEURGMs) and may affect an institution's ability to ensure equity in the selection of residency applicants and, thus, warrant further consideration. The authors examine these recommendations from a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) perspective. For each of the first 3 WG recommendations, the authors highlight new opportunities created by the recommendations and detail challenges that programs must carefully navigate to ensure equity for all candidates. The authors also recommend solutions to guide programs as they address these challenges, meet new common program requirements, and attempt to promote equity for HEURGMs. Finally, the authors recommend that after the 2020-2021 recruitment cycle, the medical education community evaluate DEI-related outcomes of both the WG's and the authors' recommendations and incorporate the findings into future application cycles.</ab>

        <ab>Responding quickly to HIV outbreaks is one of four pillars of the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative. Inclusion of cluster detection and response in the fourth pillar of EHE has led to public discussion concerning bioethical implications of cluster detection and response and molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) among public health authorities, researchers, and community members. This study reports on findings from a qualitative analysis of interviews with community members and providers regarding their knowledge and perspectives of MHS. We identified five key themes: (a) context matters, (b) making sense of MHS, (c) messaging, equity, and resource prioritization, (d) operationalizing confidentiality, and (e) stigma, vulnerability, and power. Inclusion of community perspectives in generating innovative approaches that address bioethical concerns related to the use of MHS data is integral to ensure that widely accessible information about the use of these data is available to a diversity of community members and providers.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant disparities experienced by Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with the Coronavirus have underscored the imperative to increase the size and diversity of the healthcare workforce, including nursing. Academically focused pipeline development programs have led to some advances in minority recruitment and retention; however, emerging research highlights the importance of extra-academic factors that reduce the sense of belonging and persistence among underrepresented and minority students. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the diversity, equity, and inclusion goals and activities of a college of nursing located in a minority-serving institution. Here, we emphasize the description of a range of activities aimed at meeting our diversity goals. Further, we highlight the actions initiated in response to emergent "extra-academic" student needs over the past year related to the COVID-19 pandemic and police brutality. The strategies described have implications for improving diversity, equity, and inclusion among higher education institutions in nursing.</ab>

        <ab>With Covid-19 impacting communities in different ways, research has increasingly turned to big data analytics (BDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools to track and monitor the virus's spread and its effect on humanity and the global economy. The purpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth literature review to identify how BDA and AI were involved in the management of Covid-19 (while considering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)). The rigorous search resulted in a portfolio of 607 articles, retrieved from the Web of Science database, where content analysis has been conducted. This study identifies the BDA and AI applications developed to deal with the initial Covid-19 outbreak and the containment of the pandemic, along with their benefits for the social good. Moreover, this study reveals the DEI challenges related to these applications, ways to mitigate the concerns, and how to develop viable techniques to deal with similar crises in the future. The article pool recognized the high presence of machine learning (ML) and the role of mobile technology, social media and telemedicine in the use of BDA and AI during Covid-19. This study offers a collective insight into many of the key issues and underlying complexities affecting public health and society from Covid-19, and the solutions offered from information systems and technological perspectives.</ab>

        <ab>This rapid review aimed to identify the strategies used to (re)integrate essential caregivers (ECs) into the LTC setting, particularly pertaining to principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion. In addition, this rapid review aimed to identify the strategies used during prior infectious disease threats, when similar blanket visitor restrictions were implemented in LTC homes. The review was part of a larger effort to support LTC homes in Ontario.</ab>
        <ab>A rapid review was conducted in accordance with principles from the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools.</ab>
        <ab>ECs, residents, staff, and policy decision makers in long-term care home settings.</ab>
        <ab>Five electronic databases were searched for academic and gray literature using predefined search terms. Selected documents met inclusion criteria if they included policy guidance or an intervention to (re)integrate ECs into LTC homes at the local, national, and/or international level.</ab>
        <ab>In total, 15 documents met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All documents retrieved focused on the context of COVID-19. Documents were either policy guidance (n = 13) or primary research studies (n = 2). Documents differed in these notable ways: Definition of EC; the degree to which an EC is recognized for her or his role in the care of the resident; the degree to which ECs are (re)integrated into the LTC setting is prioritized; response to community spread of COVID-19; visitation during an outbreak or if a resident is symptomatic; the reliance on equity, diversity, and inclusion principles; and lastly, monitoring and improving the process.</ab>
        <ab>Using an equity, diversity, and inclusion lens, we posit promising practices for (re)integration. It is clear from the rapid review that more research is needed to understand the efficacy of policies and guidelines to (re)integrate ECs into the LTC setting. Until such evidence is available, expert opinion will drive best care practices.</ab>

        <ab>Efforts toward achieving diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) within graduate medical education (GME) often begin with the formation of a DEIJ committee that steers the work. Little is known about the experiences and the challenges faced by those serving on such committees. We sought to describe the experiences of members of our institutional GME DEIJ committee to gain knowledge that would propel this work forward. An open-ended survey was electronically administered to members of our institutional GME DEIJ committee. Responses were analyzed using a rapid qualitative analytical approach. Eighteen members (58%) responded. Of these, (67%) were women and five (28%) were Black. Six domains emerged: "motivation," "challenges," "emotional response," "highs," "facilitators," and "advice." Black respondents more often cited the need to increase diversity as a motivator to join this work. Women and Black respondents more often identified time constraints as a challenge to participation. Some members found the work emotionally draining; others described it as uplifting. Two themes emerged as high points of participation-pride and achievement around the work completed and the personal benefits of building a community with a shared purpose. Three themes emerged as facilitators: effective leadership, support, and establishing psychological safety during the meetings. Many arrived at the realization that change would take time and advocated for patience and perseverance. Protected time and DEIJ expertise were identified as integral to successful committee work. Our findings provide novel insights into the experience of serving on a GME DEIJ committee and highlights infrastructural and institutional prerequisites for success.</ab>

        <ab>There is a lack of curricula addressing the alarming rates of resident physician mistreatment. As the ACGME works to address diversity, equity, and inclusion in GME, there has been increasing attention paid to the issue of mistreatment. Previous studies have noted a high prevalence of mistreatment within GME. Despite this, there are few published interventions to address the mistreatment of residents. We developed a workshop for residents to provide an overview of mistreatment in residency and teach them REWIND (relax, express, why, inquire, negotiate, determine), a communication tool to address mistreatment directly.</ab>
        <ab>We designed a 60-minute workshop for residents with didactics on mistreatment in GME, followed by three case discussions. Four case scenarios were developed to represent different types of mistreatment and situations. We implemented the workshop twice and asked participants to self-rate proficiency around the workshop objectives with pre- and postsurveys.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 11 GME learners completed both the pre- and postsurveys between the two workshop implementations. GME learners who responded demonstrated significantly higher self-rated proficiency on each objective postworkshop compared to preworkshop ( p &lt; .05).

        <ab>Over the past decade, institutions have earmarked more resources to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). However, many struggle to measure the effectiveness of their efforts and communicate them to the scientific community.

        <ab>Recent increased visibility on racial issues in the United States elicited public outcry and a collective call for action. The social justice movement has facilitated energetic discussions about race, sexual orientation, and various issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This article discusses issues faced by people of color that we as scientists can address, as well as challenges faced by women and internationally trained scientists in the scientific community that need immediate attention. Moreover, we highlight various ways to resolve such issues at both institutional and individual levels. Silence and incremental solutions are no longer acceptable to achieving lasting social justice and ensure prosperous societies that work for all.</ab>

        <ab>Patient advocates are increasingly authoring peer-reviewed publications that could enhance patient care and understanding of the lived experience. Although patient authorship may be seen as an innovation in the peer-reviewed publication environment and some may not be aware of or accept patient authorship, we know patient-authored publications exist. However, identifying patient-authored publications is often challenging and time-consuming.</ab>
        <ab>In this commentary, we propose a definition for a patient author and patient-authored publications. We outline factors driving the increase in patient authorship, including patient interest, recognition of the value of including the patient voice and major funders recognising the importance of involving patient advocates in research. Evidence and experience-based guidance on patient authorship is emerging, and we highlight practical guidance for patient advocates on authoring peer-reviewed publications. To gain a better understanding of patient authorship, an efficient method is needed to identify patient-authored publications. A dataset on patient-authored publications could be used for a range of quantitative and qualitative research studies. The affiliation search function in PubMed can provide an easy, and reproducible way to identify a dataset of patient-authored publications in the international peer-reviewed literature, but only if patient authors include a standard metatag, (e.g. Patient Author) as one of their listed affiliations, combined with other affiliations as appropriate. From 2020 to 2021, there was a nine-fold increase in patient-authored publications in PubMed identified using the Patient Author tag. We recognize that terminology can be contentious and some authors may prefer alternative metatags. Further efforts are required to gain consensus on a suitable, standard metatag or set of metatags to use to show the true extent of patient authorship.</ab>
        <ab>Patient authorship is not only legitimate, but it also exemplifies the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. Stakeholders in the publication community need to review their policies and procedures to identify and address barriers to patient authorship. Patient advocates, funders, researchers and publishers could all help to promote awareness and acceptance of patient authorship and the merits of using a standard metatag or set of metatags, so that patient-authored publications are no longer hidden in plain sight.</ab>

        <ab>Equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion are terms covered in the academic literature focusing on sports, kinesiology, physical education, and physical activity, including in conjunction with marginalized groups. Universities in many countries use various EDI policy frameworks and work under the EDI headers "equality, diversity and inclusion", "equity, diversity and inclusion", "diversity, equity and inclusion", and similar phrases (all referred to as EDI) to rectify problems students, non-academic staff, and academic staff from marginalized groups, such as women, Indigenous peoples, visible/racialized minorities, disabled people, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S+) experience. Which EDI data, if any, are generated influences EDI efforts in universities (research, education, and general workplace climate) of all programs.</ab>
        <ab>Our study used a scoping review approach and employed SCOPUS and the 70 databases of EBSCO-Host, which includes SportDiscus, as sources aimed to analyze the extent (and how) the academic literature focusing on sports, kinesiology, physical education, and physical activity engages with EDI.</ab>
        <ab>We found only 18 relevant sources and a low to no coverage of marginalized groups linked to EDI, namely racialized minorities (12), women (6), LGBTQ2S+ (5), disabled people (2), and Indigenous peoples (0).</ab>
        <ab>Our findings suggest a gap in the academic inquiry and huge opportunities.</ab>

        <ab>The 13 th annual Canadian National Proteomics Network was held in May 2022 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. More than 175 individuals participated in this dynamic and productive meeting either in-person or virtually. A pre-symposium organized by trainees and dedicated to highlighting the best and brightest emerging talent in proteomics across Canada preceded the main symposium, which welcomed plenary and invited speakers from around the world. The presentations covering ground-breaking science were interspersed with critical discussions on improving equity, diversity, and inclusion within the proteomics community across Canada, along with important networking opportunities for early-career researchers.</ab>

        <ab>There has never been a stronger call for authenticity in health professions education than this moment in time. The health inequities laid bare by the COVID-19 syndemic (a concept that describes the clustering of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease by political, social, and economic factors) compels health professions educators to learn how to best engage in, sustain, and deepen conversations on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within our learning environments. Health professions curricula should address such concerns through explicit faculty training programs in dialogue models of communication. In this commentary, I propose that medical improv can help refocus health professions training to the humanistic values of empathy for others and respect for multiple viewpoints. Medical improv refers to teaching methods that adapt improvisation principles and exercises to enhance professional competencies in the health professions, such as communication. I describe a training series implemented at one institution to prepare faculty facilitators to engage in conversations about DEI in a discussion-based core course on the social determinants of health for first year medical students called "Humanity in Medicine." Key elements of dialogue training, including examinations of identity and positionality, caretaking and team-making, and conversations with a skeptic, are viewed through the lens of improv exercises as a pedagogy in communication. I report on facilitator and medical students' positive response to facilitator training and the Humanity in Medicine course. Potential next steps towards a formal evaluation of the method, and outcomes assessments of the use of improv in health professions training are discussed.</ab>

        <ab>As the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) began to ask programs to report their efforts surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), program directors felt ill prepared to evaluate their programs and measure change.</ab>
        <ab>To develop a tool that would allow graduate medical education (GME) programs to evaluate the current state of DEI within their residencies, identify areas of need, and track progress; to evaluate feasibility of using this assessment method within family medicine training programs; and to analyze and report pilot data from implementation of these milestones within family medicine residency programs.</ab>
        <ab>The Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors (AFMRD) Diversity and Health Equity (DHE) Task Force developed a tool for program DEI evaluation modeled after the ACGME Milestones. These milestones focus on DEI assessment in 5 key domains: Institution, Curriculum, Evaluation, Resident Personnel, and Faculty Personnel. After finalizing a draft, a pilot implementation of the milestones was conducted by a convenience sample of 10 AFMRD DHE Task Force members for their own programs.</ab>
        <ab>Scores varied widely across surveyed programs for all milestones. Highest average scores were seen for the Curriculum milestone (2.65) and the lowest for the Faculty Personnel milestone (2.0). Milestone assessments were completed within 10 to 40 minutes using various methods.</ab>
        <ab>The AFMRD DEI Milestones were developed for program assessment, goal setting, and tracking of progress related to DEI within residency programs. The pilot implementation showed these milestones were easily used by family medicine faculty members in diverse settings.</ab>

        <ab>In 2021, the American Association for Anatomy (AAA) Board of Directors appointed a Task Force on Structural Racism to understand how the laws, rules, and practices in which the Association formed, developed and continues to exist affect membership and participation. This commentary is the first public report from the Task Force. We focus on African Americans with some comments on Jews and women, noting that all marginalized groups deserve study. Through much of its 130 year history, some members were an essential part of perpetuating racist ideas, the Association largely ignored racism and had some practices that prevented participation. The Task Force concluded that individual and structural racism within the AAA, combined with the broader social context in which the Association developed, contributed to the current underrepresentation of African Americans who constitute 4.1% of the membership even though 13.4% of the U.S. population is Black. Intentional efforts within the AAA to reckon with racism and other forms of bias have only begun in the last 10-20 years. These actions have led to more diverse leadership within the Association, and it is hoped that these changes will positively affect the recruitment and retention of marginalized people to science in general and anatomy in particular. The Task Force recommends that the AAA Board issue a statement of responsibility to acknowledge its history. Furthermore, the Task Force advocates that the Board commit to (a) sustaining ongoing projects to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion and (b) dedicating additional resources to facilitate novel initiatives.</ab>

        <ab>This article offers a framework for critically examining the structures, policies, norms, practices, and values that shape the Urology Match as a foundation for interventions to improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice in the workforce. Points of leverage for transformational change in the urology workforce diversification include modifying the structure of the urology application process, optimizing reviewer factors, addressing Under-Represented in Medicine applicant experience, providing resources to applicants, and evaluating selection criteria. To achieve an inclusive diverse urology workforce, we must change policy and practice, expand what we include in the norm, which will translate into increased value ascribed to a more varied cohort of applicants, leading to the establishment of structures that accommodate true diversity.</ab>

        <ab>This special issue is unlike any other special issue published in this journal's history. You will not find the types of original research in anatomy and evolutionary biology that you are accustomed to seeing adorning the pages of The Anatomical Record. Instead, the articles included cover the past and future of the discipline of anatomy broadly and of the American Association for Anatomy (AAA) more narrowly, and through two specific rhetorical frames: ethics; and diversity, equity, and inclusion. The articles in this issue are divided into two sections. The first section traces the history of anatomy and addresses many of the ethical dilemmas we face as a result of that history. The second section sets the stage for how the discipline and the AAA move forward to create a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive future for students, teachers, colleagues, and everyone else we touch through our work as anatomists. While this is only the beginning of our reconciliation with our past, the future certainly looks bright.</ab>

        <ab>To address healthcare inequities, diversifying the physician workforce is an important step, and improved efforts to recruit Underrepresented in Medicine (URiM) students is vital. We aim to examine the current state of minority recruitment and provide solutions to increase diversity in urology residency training.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a retrospective analysis of self-reported race and ethnicity data for active urology trainees using the Data Resource Book by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education from 2011 to 2020. We also performed a longitudinal analysis comparing the number of urology applicants to urology trainees from 2016 to 2020 using the Electronic Residency Application Service statistics database. URiMs were designated in alignment with ACGME definitions. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and compared using chi-squared test between race and ethnicity.</ab>
        <ab>We identified 11,458 active urology trainees for analysis. Of these, 6638 (57.9%) identified as White, 1690 (14.7%) as Asian/Pacific Islander, 442 (3.9%) as Hispanic, 380 (3.3%) as Black, 11 (0.1%) as Native American, 608 (5.3%) as other race/ethnicity, and 1689 (14.7%) as unknown race or ethnicity. In 2011, 8.1% of trainees identified as URiM which remains the same at 8.2% in 2020.</ab>
        <ab>As we strive to improve patient care and support our URiM colleagues, diversity, equity, and inclusion must be prioritized. Despite increases in students entering medical school and the expansion of urology training spots, the numbers of URiM in urologic training remain stubbornly unchanged. This work highlights an area of residency training that requires critical transformation.</ab>

        <ab>Hospitals have been facing an epic crisis, with the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelming emergency departments and forcing the implementation of surge protocols to manage care delivery and treatment. These realities have affected both inpatient care delivery and caregiver effectiveness. The need to reevaluate clinical operations is challenging the healthcare delivery structure and its leadership to think differently-digitally. Supporting care for patients in the home has played an important role in mitigating many safety and access issues, accelerating telehealth adoption and solidifying its place in the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery. As this shift continues to unfold, it is also bringing an opportunity to improve clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost reduction efforts as well as advance access and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the US healthcare delivery system.</ab>

        <ab>As organizations that facilitate collaboration and communication, scientific societies have an opportunity, and a responsibility, to drive inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility in science in academia. The American Association for Anatomy (AAA), with its expressed and practiced culture of engagement, can serve as a model of best practice for other professional associations working to become more inclusive of individuals from historically underrepresented groups. In this publication, we acknowledge anatomy's exclusionary past, describe the present face of science in academia, and provide recommendations for societies, including the AAA, to accelerate change in academia. We are advocating for scientific societies to investigate inequities and revise practices for inclusivity; develop and empower underrepresented minority leadership; and commit resources in a sustained manner as an investment in underrepresented scientists who bring diverse perspectives and lived experiences to science in academia.</ab>

        <ab>The new Canadian Institutes of Health Research - Institute of Health Services and Policy Research's Strategic Plan 2021-2026 (CIHR IHSPR 2021) holds potential. Barriers are anticipated, including that commitments to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) are tokenistic. This commentary provides four recommendations to support EDI as transformative. First, EDI must start with an honest history of the role of institutions in upholding injustice. Second, performative EDI must be replaced by changes in money, power and resources. Third, data collection alone must never be the end goal of EDI. And fourth, for EDI to be transformative, it must be grounded in praxis, taking direction from communities and movements seeking justice.</ab>

        <ab>Multiple recent surveys have examined the prevalence of female first or senior authors on publications for various scientific and medical disciplines. First and senior authorships are significant achievements for purposes of professional advancement, especially in academia. Such surveys can also provide information regarding diversity and inclusion. In this report, we present the findings of a survey performed to assess how frequently female contributors were first or senior authors in 2 of the most widely-circulated peer-reviewed journals of laboratory animal medicine and science in the United States; data were collected at 3 time points over a recent 20-y span. These data were then compared against estimated populations of potential female authors, as determined from membership rolls in the American Society of Laboratory Animal Practitioners and the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine. Survey results suggest that female authors increased their representation as influential authors over time, in contrast to representation trends reported for other disciplines. However, whether this increase has mirrored the increase in women overall in the veterinary profession during this time span is unknown. In an era of greater attention and sensitivity to equity and inclusion, this survey is offered as a starting point for further conversation within the field of laboratory animal medicine and science.</ab>

        <ab>Black faculty and trainees remain underrepresented in academic medicine because of systemic racism. Years of diversity and inclusion efforts have not succeeded in eliminating the unique challenges faced by Black faculty in academic medicine.</ab>
        <ab>To elicit expert faculty perspectives on anti-Black racism in academic medicine based on lived and/or professional experience and to solicit recommendations for an intervention for faculty to dismantle anti-Black racism within academic medical centers.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study included semistructured interviews with experts in understanding and dismantling anti-Black racism within academic medical centers. Participants had expertise in anti-Black racism through their lived experience as a Black faculty member and/or professional experience in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Participants were recruited from academic medical centers from around the United States. Interviews were conducted through an online meeting platform, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subsequently coded following an inductive qualitative description approach. Interviews were completed between October 2020 and March 2021.</ab>
        <ab>Outcomes include the experiences of Black faculty and trainees in academic medicine and recommendations for developing an intervention to dismantle anti-Black racism within academic medicine.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 16 participants completed this study; most identified as Black or African American (9 [56%]) and female (10 [63%]). Results were sorted into 2 content domains, with several themes within those domains: (1) barriers faced by Black faculty and trainees and potential solutions and (2) recommendations for an intervention directed at faculty to dismantle anti-Black racism in academic medicine. Barriers faced by Black faculty and trainees included lack of representation; challenges with the recruitment, retention, and promotion of Black faculty; and experiences of microaggressions and overt racism. Participants suggested that an intervention should have a comprehensive learning objective; be mandatory for all faculty, with the exception of Black faculty; draw from outside expertise; and receive allocation of resources and funding equal to other important training modules.</ab>
        <ab>The findings of this study affirm prior work about the unique challenges faced by Black faculty and trainees in academic medicine because of interpersonal and institutional racism and build on this prior work by soliciting recommendations to guide intervention development. An intervention to dismantle anti-Black racism within academic medicine is urgently needed and will require leadership buy-in and financial commitments from institutions for effective development and implementation.</ab>

        <ab>The purpose of this study was to calculate the male to female dean ratio in the US dental schools, assess whether the dean's gender is affected by specific school characteristics (such as geographic location or class size), and determine whether the dean's gender affects the percent of women in the school leadership team.</ab>
        <ab>Each US school's website was reviewed to capture the name and gender of each dean and others holding assistant, associate or vice dean positions. All data were entered in an Excel database (Microsoft Excel 2016) and analyzed using a statistical analysis software program (IBM SPSS Statistics, v26; IBM Corp). The level of significance was set to α = 0.05.</ab>
        <ab>The male to female dean ratio (approximately 5:1) differed significantly from the hypothesized ratio 1:1 (z = 5.22, p &lt; 0.001). Mean class size (χ 2  = 0.869, p = 0.351) and school funding source (χ 2  = 0.430, p = 0.512) did not differ between schools with a male versus female dean. The percentage of women in the school's leadership team was higher in schools with a female dean (U = 151, p = 0.004).</ab>
        <ab>In the US dental schools, there is one female dean for every five deans who are male, indicating underrepresentation of women at the highest role in academic leadership. Schools with female deans tend to have more women in other administrative roles as well. Change is needed in order to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic dentistry.</ab>

        <ab>The Harriet F. Ginsburg Health Sciences Library at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine collaborated with the college's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to enhance its existing diversity programming, created to foster a sense of community throughout the college. Through this partnership, a library-driven idea for an occasional diversity-themed lunch and learn session gained valuable institutional support and transformed into a larger event series. A second related project emerged with a goal of creating a diversity corner for the college. These collaborative efforts have helped the library further its mission to be an inclusive entity within the college and have afforded the library greater programming reach.</ab>

Using their skills, knowledge, and expertise, nurses are poised to lead quality improvement efforts that enhance patient outcomes, reduce inequities among populations, and contain costs. Culturally aligned organizational models are built on key concepts of cultural competency, patient- and family-centered care, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging concepts. Nurses are poised to lead cultural alignment innovations across health-care professional teams, using their foundational skills to enhance quality and safety across the health-care spectrum.</ab>

        <ab>Research into the genetic and genomic ("genomics") foundations of disease is central to our understanding of disease prevention, early detection, diagnostic accuracy, and therapeutic intervention. Inequitable participation in genomics research by historically excluded populations limits the ability to translate genomic knowledge to achieve health equity and ensure that findings are generalizable to diverse populations.</ab>
        <ab>We propose a novel framework for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in genomics research. Building on principles of community-based participatory research and collective impact frameworks, the framework can guide our understanding of the social, cultural, health system, policy, community, and individual contexts in which engagement and genomics research are being done. Our framework highlights the involvement of a multistakeholder team, including the participants and communities to be engaged, to ensure robust methods for recruitment, retention, return of genomic results, quality of engagement, follow-up, and monitoring of participants.</ab>
        <ab>The proposed engagement framework will guide investigators in optimizing equitable representation in research and enhancing the rigor of genomics investigation.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, inclusion, and health equity (DIHE) are integral to the practice of family medicine. Academic family medicine has been grappling with these issues in recent years, particularly with a focus on racism and health inequity. We studied the current state of DIHE activities in academic family medicine departments and suggest a framework for departments to become more diverse, inclusive, antiracist, and focused on health equity and racial justice.</ab>
        <ab>As part of a larger annual membership survey, family medicine department chairs were asked for their assessment of departmental DIHE and antioppression activities, and infrastructure and resources committed to increasing DIHE.</ab>
        <ab>More than 60% of family medicine department chairs participating in this study rate their departments highly in promoting DIHE and antioppression, and 66% of chairs report an institutional infrastructure that is working well. Just over half of departments or institutions have had a climate survey in the past 3 years, 47.3% of departments have a diversity officer, and 26% of departments provide protected time or resources for a diversity officer.</ab>
        <ab>The majority of family medicine department chairs rate their departments highly on DIHE. However, only 50% of departments have formally assessed climate in the past 3 years, fewer have diversity officers, and even fewer invest resources in their diversity officers. This disconnect should motivate academic family medicine departments to undertake formal self-assessment and implement a strategic plan that includes resource investment in DIHE, measurable outcomes, and sustainability.</ab>

        <ab>With increased media scrutiny, public awareness, and research on the prevalence of maltreatment experiences in sport, sport organizations have faced increased pressures to combat unsafe practices in sport. A consequence has been the emergence of the Safe Sport movement whereby organizations including the International Olympic Committee, Safe Sport International, US Center for SafeSport, Sport Canada, and others, have developed policies, initiatives, and education intended to create safer sport environments for all participants. Most of these policies have been implemented using a top-down approach, driven by government officials and sport leaders. However, if safe sport initiatives are to benefit athletes, consideration and incorporation of athletes' perspectives in the development and implementation of initiatives are imperative. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine athletes' perspectives on the challenges and recommendations to advancing safe sport. As part of a large-scale survey of current and retired Canadian National Team Athletes' experiences of maltreatment, open-ended questions were asked about athletes' recommendations and considerations for safe sport. Responses to these questions ( n = 386) were analyzed using thematic analysis. According to the participants, barriers and challenges to safe sport included emphasizing performance excellence at-all-costs, normalization and complicity of harm, lack of attention to equity, diversity and inclusion, a culture of fear and silence, and a lack of trust in organizations to handle cases of harm. In an effort to advance safe sport, participants recommended prioritizing holistic athlete development, improving and strengthening accountability measures, implementing an independent 3rd party for disclosure, reporting and support, increased attention to equity, diversity and inclusion, stakeholder education, prohibition of sexual relations between athletes and those in positions of power and authority, and adoption of a broader perspective of harms and perpetrators. Findings are interpreted and critiqued in light of previous literature and recommendations for future research and practice are suggested.</ab>

        <ab>Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs; provided without obligation) for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities (e.g. orphanhood, old age, or HIV infection) are a social protection intervention addressing a key social determinant of health (income) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided only if recipients follow prescribed behaviours, e.g. use a health service or attend school) is unknown.</ab>
        <ab>To assess the effects of UCTs on health services use and health outcomes in children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure, and to compare the effects of UCTs versus CCTs.</ab>
        <ab>For this update, we searched 15 electronic academic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EconLit, in September 2021. We also searched four electronic grey literature databases, websites of key organisations and reference lists of previous systematic reviews, key journals and included study records.</ab>
        <ab>We included both parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (≥ 18 years) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT, a smaller UCT or a CCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.</ab>
        <ab>Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We obtained missing data from study authors if feasible. For C-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was impossible, we synthesised results using vote counting based on effect direction. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.</ab>
        <ab>We included 34 studies (25 studies of 20 C-RCTs, six CBAs, and three cohort studies) involving 1,140,385 participants (45,538 children, 1,094,847 adults) and 50,095 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative syntheses. These analysed 29 independent data sets. The 24 UCTs identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 81.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT; three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection or performance bias, or both). Most studies were funded by national governments or international organisations, or both. Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-certainty evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-certainty evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-certainty evidence. Health services use We assumed greater use of any health services to be beneficial. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between 12 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09; I 2 = 2%; 5 C-RCTs, 4972 participants; low-certainty evidence). Health outcomes At one to two years, UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, very large reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the previous two weeks to three months (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; I 2 = 53%; 6 C-RCTs, 9367 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). UCTs may have increased the likelihood of having been food secure over the previous month, at 13 to 36 months into the intervention (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; I 2 = 85%; 5 C-RCTs, 2687 participants; low-certainty evidence). UCTs may have increased participants' level of dietary diversity over the previous week, when assessed with the Household Dietary Diversity Score and followed up 24 months into the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.59 food categories, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.01; I 2 = 79%; 4 C-RCTs, 9347 participants; low-certainty evidence). Despite several studies providing relevant evidence, the effects of UCTs on the likelihood of being moderately stunted and on the level of depression remain uncertain. We found no study on the effect of UCTs on mortality risk. Social determinants of health UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the likelihood of currently attending school, when assessed at 12 to 24 months into the intervention (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09; I 2 = 0%; 8 C-RCTs, 7136 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). UCTs may have reduced the likelihood of households being extremely poor, at 12 to 36 months into the intervention (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; I 2 = 63%; 6 C-RCTs, 3805 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was uncertain for whether UCTs impacted livestock ownership, participation in labour, and parenting quality. Healthcare expenditure Evidence from eight cluster-RCTs on healthcare expenditure was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that UCTs may have increased the amount of money spent on health care at 7 to 36 months into the intervention (low-certainty evidence). Equity, harms and comparison with CCTs The effects of UCTs on health equity (or unfair and remedial health inequalities) were very uncertain. We did not identify any harms from UCTs. Three cluster-RCTs compared UCTs versus CCTs with regard to the likelihood of having used any health services or had any illness, or the level of dietary diversity, but evidence was limited to one study per outcome and was very uncertain for all three.</ab>
        <ab>This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), two social determinants of health (i.e. the likelihoods of attending school and being extremely poor), and healthcare expenditure. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of UCTs and CCTs remains very uncertain.</ab>

        <ab>Nature-based Climate Solutions are landscape stewardship techniques to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil or biomass carbon sequestration. These mitigation approaches to climate change present an opportunity to supplement energy sector decarbonization and provide co-benefits in terms of ecosystem services and landscape productivity. The biological engineering profession must be involved in the research and implementation of these solutions-developing new tools to aid in decision-making, methods to optimize across different objectives, and new messaging frameworks to assist in prioritizing among different options. Furthermore, the biological engineering curriculum should be redesigned to reflect the needs of carbon-based landscape management. While doing so, the biological engineering community has an opportunity to embed justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion within both the classroom and the profession. Together these transformations will enhance our capacity to use sustainable landscape management as an active tool to mitigate the risks of climate change.</ab>

        <ab>This paper reports on topics discussed at a Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco pre-conference workshop at the 2019 annual Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco meeting. The goal of the pre-conference workshop was to help develop a shared understanding of the importance of several tobacco-related priority groups in tobacco use disorder (TUD) treatment research and to highlight challenges in measurement related to these groups. The workshop focused on persons with minoritized sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation identities; persons with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds; persons with lower socioeconomic status (SES); and persons with mental health concerns. In addition to experiencing commercial tobacco-related health disparities, these groups are also underrepresented in tobacco research, including TUD treatment studies. Importantly, there is wide variation in how and whether researchers are identifying variation within these priority groups. Best practices for measuring and reporting sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, SES, and mental health concerns in TUD treatment research are needed. This paper provides information about measurement challenges when including these groups in TUD treatment research and specific recommendations about how to measure these groups and assess potential disparities in outcomes. The goal of this paper is to encourage TUD treatment researchers to use measurement best practices in these priority groups in an effort to conduct meaningful and equity-promoting research. Increasing the inclusion and visibility of these groups in TUD treatment research will help to move the field forward in decreasing tobacco-related health disparities. Implications: Tobacco-related disparities exist for a number of priority groups including, among others, women, individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities, individuals with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds, individuals with lower SES, and individuals with mental health concerns. Research on TUD treatments for many of these subgroups is lacking. Accurate assessment and consideration of these subgroups will provide needed information about efficacious and effective TUD treatments, about potential mediators and moderators, and for accurately describing study samples, all critical elements for reducing tobacco-related disparities, and improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in TUD treatment research.</ab>

        <ab>To advance justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in science, we must first understand and improve the dominant-culture frameworks that impede progress and, second, we must intentionally create more equitable models. The present authors call ourselves the ICBOs and Allies Workgroup (ICBOs stands for independent community-based organizations), and we represent communities historically excluded from the sciences. Together with institutional allies and advisors, we began our research because we wanted our voices to be heard, and we hoped to bring a different perspective to doing science with and not on communities. We created a community framework to guide our research and we led all aspects of our work, from creating research protocols to analyzing and interpreting the data to disseminating the results. We share our research framework, methods, and results so that science institutions can better understand how to intentionally create more equitable research partnerships with our communities.</ab>

        <ab>Background: The need for competent research managers and administrators (RMAs) has increased due to the complexity in managing research projects between disparate and international partners. To facilitate the creation of robust training and professional development programmes it is essential to first understand the status quo. A collaborative project, Sustainable Management and Administration for Research: Training across the project Lifecycle (SMARTLife), made up of RMAs from South Africa, Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom (UK) developed a set of competencies to conduct an RMA competency-based training needs assessment scoping tool. Method: Nine areas were identified: Equitable partnership; Finance Management; Project Management; Monitoring and Evaluation; Reporting and Communications; Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion; Training and Capacity Development; Impact a&amp; Sustainability; and Ethical, Social, Legal a&amp; Social Implications.  Tasks for each competency area were identified to develop an scoping tool that had 168 data collection points. The tool was advertised through press releases, mailing lists and social media. Results:  108 responses were obtained:  with 49% from 15 Africa countries/the remainder from the UK. The UK (71%) had more permanent RMA staff members compared to Africa (39%). There were more respondents in Africa with the title of Research Manager/Coordinator(p=0.0132) compared to the UK where most of the RMAs were employed as Finance/Contract officers. 60% of respondents from the UK had more than three years experience while only 35% from Africa had experience. While most RMAs had formal higher education qualifications, their training was not in research management and administration, which requires a diverse range of skills. Confidence in specific tasks varied between the UK and Africa whereas collaborative partnerships challenges and enablers were similar. Conclusion This work highlights differences in RMA training and experience RMA  between Africa and UK, this work could inform much needed competency-based training for RMAs and partnership strategies that aid mutual-learning.</ab>

        <ab>The specialty of radiation oncology's gender diversity is lagging other medical specialties. The lack of gender diversity in radiation oncology has been demonstrated at all stages of career, from medical schools to department chairs. Multiple articles have demonstrated literature-based benefits of inclusion of a diverse group of female colleagues. This editorial is intended to note areas of progress and highlight resources available to support gender equity in the field of radiation oncology.</ab>

        <ab>There is a growing concern that the voices of athletes, and in particular, athletes from equity-deserving groups, are unaccounted for in the development and advancement of Safe Sport initiatives. The lack of consideration of the needs and experiences of diverse groups is concerning, given the existing literature outside the context of sport indicating that equity-deserving individuals experience more violence. As such, the following study sought to understand how equity-deserving athletes interpret and experience Safe Sport. Grounded within an interpretive phenomenological analysis, semi-structured interviews were used to understand how athletes with marginalised identities conceptualise and experience Safe Sport. Seven participants, including two Black male athletes, two White, gay male athletes, one Middle Eastern female athlete, one White, female athlete with a physical disability and one White, non-binary, queer, athlete with a physical disability, were asked to conceptualise and describe their experiences of Safe Sport. The findings revealed these athletes perceived Safe Sport as an unrealistic and unattainable ideal that cannot fully be experienced by those from equity-deserving groups. This interpretation was reinforced by reported experiences of discriminatory comments, discriminatory behaviours and systemic barriers, perpetrated by coaches, teammates, and resulting from structural aspects of sport. The findings draw on the human rights literature to suggest integrating principles of equity, diversity and inclusion are fundamental to safeguarding equity-deserving athletes.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic shut down undergraduate research programs across the United States. A group of 23 colleges, universities, and research institutes hosted remote undergraduate research programs in the life sciences during Summer 2020. Given the unprecedented offering of remote programs, we carried out a study to describe and evaluate them. Using structured templates, we documented how programs were designed and implemented, including who participated. Through focus groups and surveys, we identified programmatic strengths and shortcomings as well as recommendations for improvements from students' perspectives. Strengths included the quality of mentorship, opportunities for learning and professional development, and a feeling of connection with a larger community. Weaknesses included limited cohort building, challenges with insufficient structure, and issues with technology. Although all programs had one or more activities related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, these topics were largely absent from student reports even though programs coincided with a peak in national consciousness about racial inequities and structural racism. Our results provide evidence for designing remote Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) that are experienced favorably by students. Our results also indicate that remote REUs are sufficiently positive to further investigate their affordances and constraints, including the potential to scale up offerings, with minimal concern about disenfranchising students.</ab>

        <ab>The current pipeline of physician assistant (PA) school applicants reflects the future workforce of the profession, which is why the admissions process with all its components and variables is so important. Many studies have shown that a workforce that represents the patients it cares for leads to improved health outcomes, especially among underrepresented minority populations. Yet, PA programs have made little progress over the past 2 decades in increasing the diversity of matriculants and graduates. As a profession, it is our collective responsibility to intentionally advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and examining the admissions process would be the most logical place to start.</ab>

        <ab>In this cross-sectional study, an electronic Qualtrics survey was sent to 67 Dental School Associate Deans/Deans of Academic Affairs and 15 Dental Public Health (DPH) Residency Program Directors. Survey topics included oral health equity, Critical Race Theory (CRT), racism and the physiologic impacts of racism on oral health. Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate frequencies.</ab>
        <ab>Overall response rate was 31.7% (DPH = 6, predoctoral Dental = 20). The majority of respondents that answered the question stated that the educational program offered instruction in oral health equity (96.2%), racism (75%), and the physiologic impacts of racism on oral health (83.3%). Only 17.4% of the respondents stated that the educational program offered instruction in CRT. The main barriers to providing the instruction was limited faculty trained in the topics to offer the instruction or there was limited time to offer additional content in the curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>Findings demonstrate that oral health equity, racism and the physiologic impacts of racism are being discussed in dental education to some extent, but there is limited instruction in CRT. More robust efforts are needed to ensure dental students and DPH residents are competent in providing anti-racist and unbiased health care; there should be an incorporation of anti-racism standards in the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)'s predoctoral and Advanced Education Program standards.</ab>

        <ab>Racism and colonialism impact health, physician advancement, professional development and medical education in Canada. The Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) has committed to addressing inequities in health in their recent statement on racism. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for addressing racism and colonialism in emergency medicine.</ab>
        <ab>The authors, in collaboration with a 40 member working group, conducted a literature search, held a community consultation, solicited input from expert medical, academic and community advisors, conducted a national survey of emergency physicians, and presented draft recommendations at the 2021 CAEP Academic Symposium on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion for a live facilitated discussion with a post-session survey.</ab>
        <ab>Sixteen recommendations were generated in the areas of patient care, hospital and departmental commitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, physician advancement, and professional development and medical education.</ab>
        <ab>Emergency physicians are uniquely positioned to promote equity at each encounter with patients, peers and learners. The 16 recommendations presented here are practical steps to countering racism and colonialism everyday in emergency medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Pharmacy has recognized the importance of education in health disparities and cultural competency (HDCC) for two decades. More recently, there has been emphasis on incorporating equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in pharmacy programs. While many institutions identify a need to incorporate a programmatic approach to HDCC education to meet the growing needs of a diverse population, pharmacy curricula continue to lack a holistic, programmatic approach. More than ever, Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students should graduate with the knowledge, values, and skills to provide culturally appropriate care for a diverse patient population. This commentary advocates for a holistic, programmatic approach to integrating HDCC education and serves as a call to action for curricular development. It is hoped that this commentary will also set the foundation for additional scholarly work and recommendations regarding a programmatic approach.</ab>

        <ab>Integrating equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in curricula for training health professionals is a frequent institutional goal. The use of standardized (or simulated) patient programs (SPPs) to support EDI in health sciences training is not well described. Here the authors present a theoretical model based on a synthesis of the literature for using SPPs in EDI training, along with a narrative review of the available literature.</ab>
        <ab>The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases for studies published between January 2000 and October 2019 describing the use of SPPs to support EDI in health sciences education. Studies were included if they described standardized patient (SP) education involving EDI and reported empiric data about its design, delivery, or effectiveness. The authors conducted a narrative review and provided a synthesis of the available literature, identifying key themes.</ab>
        <ab>Out of 117 studies identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (53%; n = 9) focused on cultural competence; many focused on communication with diverse patients (29%; n = 5) or health inequity (18%; n = 3). Studies employed portrayal of diversity (71%; n = 12) or learning objectives supported by diversity (29%; n = 5) as approaches to EDI relevant to SP training. Three primary themes emerged: improving cultural competence, effective communication with diverse patients, and highlighting health inequalities.</ab>
        <ab>This review outlines approaches to EDI-based SPPs, with the perspectives and priorities of institutional approaches in mind. SP education around specific EDI issues is reported; however, programmatic approaches to EDI by SPPs are lacking. More research is needed to provide further evidence for the challenges, effectiveness, and outcomes of developing and implementing EDI-based SPPs in health sciences education.</ab>

        <ab>The American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) identified diversity, equity, and inclusion as the cornerstone of excellence in governance and operations. Although efforts to increase diversity of our membership have been ongoing for years, there had not previously been an adequate investment to ensure an inclusive climate that emphasizes equity across our volunteers and programs. In June 2020, the AUGS President, Dr Shawn Menefee, and Board of Directors called for a Presidential Task Force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to study the current state of our society and make recommendations for future directions. The charge was intentionally broad. In review of the literature, there was little to inform the best means to proceed aside from administering climate surveys to gauge the current culture of inclusion and bias. The task force believed that the challenge was not only to describe the problem but also to articulate solutions. We ultimately moved to rewrite the Diversity and Inclusion and Code of Conduct Statements and develop an Action Plan that would accelerate the efforts of AUGS to foster inclusion and improve equity through the existing governance structure. In this document, we describe how the task force was organized and conducted the work to develop strategies that were aligned with the AUGS mission: "As the leader in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, AUGS drives excellence in care for women through education, research, advocacy, and interdisciplinary collaboration."</ab>

        <ab>Machine learning (ML) holds great potential for predicting clinical outcomes in heterogeneous chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) affecting children, where timely individualised treatments offer opportunities for health optimisation. This paper identifies rate-limiting steps in ML prediction model development that impair clinical translation and discusses regulatory, clinical and ethical considerations for ML implementation. A scoping review of ML prediction models in paediatric CRDs was undertaken using the PRISMA extension scoping review guidelines. From 1209 results, 25 articles published between 2013 and 2021 were evaluated for features of a good clinical prediction model using the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines.Most of the studies were in asthma (80%), with few in cystic fibrosis (12%), bronchiolitis (4%) and childhood wheeze (4%). There were inconsistencies in model reporting and studies were limited by a lack of validation, and absence of equations or code for replication. Clinician involvement during ML model development is essential and diversity, equity and inclusion should be assessed at each step of the ML pipeline to ensure algorithms do not promote or amplify health disparities among marginalised groups. As ML prediction studies become more frequent, it is important that models are rigorously developed using published guidelines and take account of regulatory frameworks which depend on model complexity, patient safety, accountability and liability.</ab>

        <ab>The recent anti-racist movements in the United States have inspired a national call for more research on the experiences of racially marginalized and minoritized students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As researchers focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, we contend that STEM education must, as a discipline, grapple with how analytic approaches may not fully support equity efforts. We discuss how researchers and educational practitioners should more critically approach STEM equity analyses and why modifying our approaches matters for STEM equity goals. Engaging with equity as a process rather than a static goal, we provide a primer of reflective questions to assist researchers with framing, analysis, and interpretation of student-level data frequently used to identify disparities and assess course-level and programmatic interventions. This guidance can inform analyses conducted by campus units such as departments and programs, but also across universities and the scientific community to enhance how we understand and address systemic inequity in STEM fields.</ab>

        <ab>The population of people with physical or sensory disabilities is growing, yet they are underrepresented in the medical and other health professions. At the same time, there is a clear need to enhance didactic curricular content and clinical training experiences that explicitly address the full scope of medical needs that individuals with disabilities have. These gaps represent missed opportunities to advance the health of an important, underserved, and growing population. Based on the authors' experience, the inclusion of people with physical or sensory disabilities in medical education greatly enhances the education of all learners and the professional development of faculty and staff, providing invaluable perspectives on the significant abilities of individuals with diverse physical or sensory disabilities. There are additional efforts and costs associated with the education of a medical student who is blind, is deaf, uses a wheelchair, or has another disability. But based on the authors' experience, it is clear that the societal return on investment is enormous, and the costs associated with a failure to embrace full inclusivity are much greater. Medical education institutions should recognize the population of people with disabilities as a vital component of their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and strive to provide inclusive education for learners with disabilities.</ab>

        <ab>English-only published literature from the past 5 years were obtained by means of a PubMed search and Google Scholar searches in addition to pertinent review articles and relevant textbooks as selected by the authors.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 62 articles were selected for their relevance to the article's objective. Older references regarding medical education trends were included when they were felt to be essential.</ab>
        <ab>Competency-based medical education is the contextual framework for curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Current trends influencing competency-based medical education are the following: e-learning; interprofessional education; simulation-based medical education; diversity, inclusion, and equity; and mentoring. This review clarifies terminology and offers examples of the potential impact of these trends within the A/I educational community. The development of knowledge and skills related to these topics can be achieved through formal faculty development, mentoring, and self-directed, asynchronous instruction.</ab>
        <ab>Medical education continues to evolve as health care adapts to meet the changing needs of the health care system and our patients. The A/I physicians should be aware of current trends because these trends impact their roles as instructors and lifelong learners.</ab>

        <ab>Background Women continue to be underrepresented in cardiology and even more so in leadership positions. We evaluated the trends and gender differences in the guideline writing groups of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines from 2006 to 2020. Methods and Results We extracted all guidelines authors from 2006 to 2020, assessed their gender from publicly available profiles, and compared differences based on subspecialties and specific societies. Stratified and trend analyses were performed using χ 2 and average annual percentage change/average 5 year percentage change. A total of 80 ACC/AHA (1288 authors [28% women]), 64 CCS (988 authors [26% women]), and 59 ESC (1157 authors [16% women]) guidelines were analyzed. A significant increase in inclusion of women was seen in ACC/AHA (12.6% [2006] to 42.6% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [2.3% to 11.1%]; P =0.005) and ESC (7.1% [2006] to 25.8% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [0.2% to 13.5%]; P =0.04), but the trend remained similar in CCS (20.6% [2006] to 36.3% [2020]; average annual percentage change, -0.1% (-3.7% to 3.5%); P =0.94), guideline authors. More women were coauthors in the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines when women were chairs of guidelines. There was a persistent disparity of women among guideline authors for general cardiology and all subspecialties, except for pediatric cardiology and heart failure guidelines. The appointment of women authors as a chair was significantly low in all societies (22.4% [ACC/AHA], 16.9% [CCS], and 7.2% [ESC]; P =0.008). Conclusions There is a significant disparity in the inclusion of women on all national guideline committees, in addition to serving as a chair of cardiology guidelines. Further advocacy is required to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion in our cardiology guidelines globally.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are crucial elements of successful veterinary emergency and critical care practices across the world. Embracing the elements of DEI creates a work environment that is safe and welcoming for all the members of the team. The American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care DEI committee was formed to enhance and support efforts to increase racial diversity in veterinary emergency and critical care, as well as provide resources that will generate DEI practices across the country. This article provides an overview of the vision of the committee and some of the steps that have been taken to create a welcoming space for all represented in veterinary emergency and critical care.</ab>

        <ab>Objective: The goal of this survey by the Medical Library Association (MLA) Diversity and Inclusion Task Force was to have a better understanding of the demographics of the association as well as ascertain how the membership feels about MLA's diversity efforts. Methods: A survey was created with the input of both task force members as well as MLA professional staff. It was administered via SurveyMonkey and distributed through email over the course of two weeks in October 2019. Results: The demographics portion of the survey--beyond asking the usual questions about race or ethnicity (72% white), age (65% between 30 and 59), and so on--also asked questions that were more specific to diversity including, but not limited to, gender representation (79% female), sexuality (67% heterosexual), military service (97% have never served), ability (26% have anxiety sometimes or in certain situations), and college financial aid (49% used federal student loans). Diversity-specific questions asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the association: 59% strongly agreed or agreed that MLA has a strong commitment to DEI; 54% felt that the amount of time that association was spending on DEI issues was just about right; and 56% were very satisfied or satisfied with the DEI environment at MLA. Members also reported feeling like they belonged in MLA (59%), they were treated with respect (77%), and they were valued by MLA (59%) Conclusion: The survey paints a picture of the membership that is much deeper than any previously conducted membership survey. It shows the diversity of membership, especially in terms of ability and religion. Generally, the membership feels that MLA is right on target with the level of focus that MLA is giving issues of diversity. This survey reinforces the diversity work that has been done and supports diversity work in MLA in the future.</ab>

        <ab>The demographics portion of the survey-beyond asking the usual questions about race or ethnicity (72% white), age (65% between 30 and 59), and so on-also asked questions that were more specific to diversity including, but not limited to, gender representation (79% female), sexuality (67% heterosexual), military service (97% have never served), ability (26% have anxiety sometimes or in certain situations), and college financial aid (49% used federal student loans). Diversity-specific questions asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the association: 59% strongly agreed or agreed that MLA has a strong commitment to DEI; 54% felt that the amount of time that association was spending on DEI issues was just about right; and 56% were very satisfied or satisfied with the DEI environment at MLA. Members also reported feeling like they belonged in MLA (59%), they were treated with respect (77%), and they were valued by MLA (59%).</ab>
        <ab>The survey paints a picture of the membership that is much deeper than any previously conducted membership survey. It shows the diversity of membership, especially in terms of ability and religion. Generally, the membership feels that MLA is right on target with the level of focus that MLA is giving issues of diversity. This survey reinforces the diversity work that has been done and supports diversity work in MLA in the future.</ab>

        <ab>Well-designed, accessible short-term research training programs are needed to recruit and retain underrepresented persons into clinical and translational research training programs and diversify the workforce. The Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research developed a summer research program, training over 270 students in 15 years. In response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we pivoted swiftly from an in-person format to a fully remote format. We describe this process, focusing on factors of diversity, equity, and inclusion including enabling student participation in remote research activities. We collected data about students' learning experiences since the program's inception; therefore, we could evaluate the impact of remote vs. in-person formats. We examined data from five cohorts: three in-person (2017-2019; n = 57) and two remote (2020-2021; n = 45). While there was some concern about the value of participating in a remote format, overall students in both formats viewed the program favorably, with students in the remote cohorts rating some aspects of the program significantly more favorably. In addition, more students who identified as Black or African American participated in the remote format than in the in-person format. We describe lessons learned from this unprecedented challenge and future program directions.</ab>

        <ab>In September 2021, the 34th Brazilian Surgical Conference hosted the "Panel: Women in Surgery" - the only session in the event solely composed of female speakers. Although gender inequities in surgery are well recognized in the international literature, the panel portrayed how distant we are from the desired equity in our country. In addition, the session emphasized the need to broaden the debate and identify the mechanisms for greater inclusion and maintenance of women in the surgical career. In this editorial, we provide a historical overview of gender disparities in the Brazilian surgical ecosystem, highlight the contributing factors to a reduced number of female surgeons, and how the structure of medical societies may influence the rise of women to leadership positions. Accordingly, we discuss the benefits of gender diversity for surgeons, patients, and institutions. Furthermore, we analyze the representation of women in the Brazilian College of Surgeons since its foundation and in the scientific sessions at the conference, demonstrating that more initiatives are required to encourage female representation in the college. Finally, we propose a series of recommendations to foster engagement and contribute to the prosperity of women surgeons in Brazil.</ab>

        <ab>The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) shares the results, conclusions, and recommendations from the initial Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Climate Survey conducted in 2021.</ab>
        <ab>The climate survey targeted medical physicists who are full members of the AAPM and included demographic inquiries and questions intended to assess the working environmental climate in terms of a sense of belonging and inclusion, experiences of discrimination and harassment, and obstacles to participation within the AAPM. The survey invitation was sent to 5500 members. Responses were collected from 1385 members (response rate of 25%) between January and February 2021.</ab>
        <ab>Overall, the medical physics workplace climate was positive. However, some demographic and professional subgroups reported lower levels of agreement with positive characteristics of their workplace climates. Compared with men, women ranked lower 7 of 8 categories that characterized the workplace climate. Other subgroups that also ranked the workplace climate descriptors lower included individuals not originally from the United States and Canada (3/8). Most respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the climate within the AAPM was welcoming. However, 17% of respondents reported personally experiencing or witnessing microaggressions within the AAPM. Overall, medical physicists reported low levels of agreement that opportunities within the AAPM were available to them, from 34% to 60% among 8 categories, including opportunities to volunteer, join committees, and compete for leadership positions within the AAPM. Several subgroups reported even lower levels of agreement that these opportunities are available. Asian and Asian American respondents (3/8) and physicists with origins in countries outside the United States and Canada (7/8) reported fewer opportunities to participate in the AAPM. Medical physicists reported their experiences of discrimination and sexual harassment in their workplaces and within the AAPM. For those who reported personal experiences of sexual harassment, only 24% (15/63) felt comfortable reporting when it occurred within their workplaces, and 35% (9/26) felt comfortable reporting when it occurred within the AAPM.</ab>
        <ab>The report concludes with several recommendations for action.</ab>

        <ab>Background Equity, diversity, and inclusion remain a challenge in the healthcare workforce. This study explored the current gender and racial/ethnic trends in academic pediatric positions across the United States. Methodology The pediatric faculty self-reported data by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed. The races were classified as White (non-Hispanic), Asian, Hispanic, Black (non-Hispanic), Multiple races (including both non-Hispanic and Hispanic), Others, and Unknown. Gender was categorized as male and female. Results The results showed that Asian, Black (non-Hispanic), and Hispanic academic pediatricians increased in full professor, associate professor, and assistant professor positions and decreased in instructor positions from 2007 to 2020. Black (non-Hispanic) academic pediatricians relatively decreased 5.5% in chairperson positions. Women increased in full professor, associate professor, instructor, and chairperson positions; however, relatively decreased 1.8% in assistant professor positions. Men and White (non-Hispanic) academic pediatricians relatively decreased 10.5% and 16%, respectively, in all academic ranks. Women, Asian, Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, and Other races were underrepresented in tenured, on-track (tenure-eligible), and not-on-track (tenure-eligible) positions. Conclusions Women and underrepresented minorities in medicine (URiM) physicians continue to remain significantly underrepresented in academic pediatric faculty positions and tenured track positions. There is a dire need to adapt multifaceted strategies to increase the engagement of women and URiM in academic pediatrics.</ab>

        <ab>Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional societies (ProSs) are uniquely positioned to foster national-level diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) reform. ProSs serve broad memberships, define disciplinary norms and culture, and inform accrediting bodies and thus provide critical levers for systems change. STEM ProSs could be instrumental in achieving the DEI system reform necessary to optimize engagement of all STEM talent, leveraging disciplinary excellence resulting from diverse teams. Inclusive STEM system reform requires that underlying "mental models" be examined. The Inclusive Professional Framework for Societies ( IPF: Societies ) is an interrelated set of strategies that can help ProSs change leaders (i.e., "boundary spanners") and organizations identify and address mental models hindering DEI reform. The IPF: Societies uses four "I's"-Identity awareness and Intercultural mindfulness (i.e., equity mindset) upon which inclusive relationships and Influential DEI actions are scaffolded. We discuss how the IPF: Societies complements existing DEI tools (e.g., Women in Engineering ProActive Network's Framework for Promoting Gender Equity within Organization; Amplifying the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success' Equity Environmental Scan Tool). We explain how the IPF: Societies can be applied to existing ProS policy and practice associated with common ProS functions (e.g., leadership, membership, conferences, awards, and professional development). The next steps are to pilot the IPF: Societies with a cohort of STEM ProSs. Ultimately, the IPF: Societies has potential to promote more efficient, effective, and lasting DEI organizational transformation and contribute to inclusive STEM disciplinary excellence.</ab>

        <ab>Although there has been a significant increase in the delivery of evidence-supported, trauma-informed care over the past few years, there has been less discussion around the consideration of the broader cultural, political, and societal factors that contextualize client trauma and that also need to be recognized and understood to promote healing and prevent future trauma. In support of sharing some best practices and lessons learned, this article provides a case study of one agency that has used the Sanctuary Model ® , an evidence-supported, trauma-informed organizational change model, to introduce the practice of cultural humility with staff as a facilitator of improved service delivery for clients from culturally marginalized communities. The model supports these endeavors through the adherence to the seven commitments, a set of organizational values for creating a trauma-informed community, allowing for all voices to be heard and considered and providing opportunities to begin the repair of previous experiences of inequity and suppression. Through the board of directors, leadership, and staff, the organization transformed its culture into one that truly supports and embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion in its operation for the benefit of both staff and clients alike.</ab>

        <ab>There currently exists an exciting impetus for increased diversity among medical trainees and improved equity in medical care received by patients. Yet, inclusion of disability within these efforts is often forgotten, allowing the current cultural narrative of ableism to shape medical training. National structural challenges as early as medical school admissions and ableist barriers throughout the educational pipeline have yielded 1) a concerningly low prevalence of medical students and physicians in the US who identify as disabled and 2) propagation of systemic misunderstandings on disability in our healthcare system. This perspective addresses the need for a re-evaluation of diversity in medicine which includes ability status and a commitment to anti-ableism as a critical part of the conversation. We propose reforms and important considerations that could have meaningful implications necessary for improving the culture of disability inclusion in medical education.</ab>

        <ab>Quality mentorship is crucial for long-term success in academia and overall job satisfaction. Unfortunately, formal mentorship training is lacking, and there is little recourse for failed mentor-mentee relationships.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a literature review to understand the current state of mentorship research with a focus on: (1) what mentorship is and why it is important for success; (2) establishing mentor-mentee relationships; and (3) the role of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>From the literature review, we compiled a number of mentorship recommendations for individuals, departments, institutions, and professional associations. These recommendations focus on building a mentorship network, establishing formalized mentorship training, how to build a productive and mutually beneficial mentor-mentee relationship, and instituting a system of mentorship accountability.</ab>
        <ab>We hope that by centralizing this information and providing a list of resources and actionable recommendations we inspire and encourage others to make meaningful changes in their approach to mentorship to create a more kind, caring, and equitable environment in which to conduct our work.</ab>

        <ab>Obesity is a chronic disease that disproportionately affects individuals from nonmajority racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Research shows that individuals from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds consider it important to have access to providers from diverse backgrounds. Health care providers and scientists from minority racial/ethnic groups are more likely than their non-Hispanic White counterparts to treat or conduct research on patients from underrepresented groups. The objective of this study was to characterize the racial/ethnic diversity of nutrition- and obesity-focused professional organizations in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>This study assessed race/ethnicity data from several obesity-focused national organizations including The Obesity Society, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the American Society for Nutrition, and the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM). Each organization was queried via emailed survey to provide data on racial/ethnic representation among their membership in the past 5 years and among elected presidents from 2010 to 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Two of the three professional societies queried did not systematically track race/ethnicity data at the time of query. Limited tracking data available from AND show underrepresentation of Black (2.6%), Asian (3.9%), Latinx (3.1%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (1.3%), or indigenous (American Indian or Alaskan Native: 0.3%) individuals compared with the US population. Underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities was also reported for ABOM diplomates (Black: 6.0%, Latinx: 5.0%, Native American: 0.2%). Only AND reported having racial/ethnic diversity (20%) among the organization's presidents within the previous decade (2010-2020).</ab>
        <ab>Findings suggest that (1) standardized tracking of race and ethnicity data is needed to fully assess diversity, equity, and inclusion, and (2) work is needed to increase the diversity of membership and leadership at the presidential level within obesity- and nutrition-focused professional organizations. A diverse cadre of obesity- and nutrition-focused health care professionals is needed to further improve nutrition-related health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and undernutrition, in this country.</ab>

        <ab>Despite statements in support of racial justice, many organizations fail to make good on their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In this review, we describe the role of the narrative of racial progress-which conceives of society as rapidly and automatically ascending toward racial equity-in these failures. Specifically, the narrative (1) envisions organizations as race neutral, (2) creates barriers to complex cross-race discussions about equity, (3) creates momentum for less effective policy change, and (4) reduces urgency around DEI goals. Thus, an effective DEI strategy will involve organizational leaders overcoming this narrative by acknowledging past DEI failures and, most critically, implementing immediate and evidence-based structural changes that are essential for creating a more just and equitable workplace.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity fosters innovation, advances the work environment, and enriches patient care. Despite that, only 17%, 5%, and 3% of cardiothoracic (CT) surgeons in academia were women, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. Diversity, equity, and inclusion goals and deliberate initiatives are necessary to eradicate disparities in the CT workforce. Leading organizational changes from the top down is paramount and above all else, changes and improvements should be based on a meritocracy.</ab>

        <ab>In response to a national call for re-evaluation of the use of race in clinical algorithms, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) established a Task Force to reassess inclusion of race in the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the United States and its implications for diagnosis and management of patients with, or at risk for, kidney diseases.</ab>
        <ab>The Task Force organized its activities over 10 months in phases to (1) clarify the problem and evidence regarding GFR estimating equations in the United States (described previously in an interim report), and, in this final report, (2) evaluate approaches to address use of race in GFR estimation, and (3) provide recommendations. We identified 26 approaches for the estimation of GFR that did or did not consider race and narrowed our focus, by consensus, to 5 of those approaches. We holistically evaluated each approach considering 6 attributes: assay availability and standardization; implementation; population diversity in equation development; performance compared with measured GFR; consequences to clinical care, population tracking, and research; and patient centeredness. To arrive at a unifying approach to estimate GFR, we integrated information and evidence from many sources in assessing strengths and weaknesses in attributes for each approach, recognizing the number of Black and non-Black adults affected.</ab>
        <ab>(1) For US adults (&gt;85% of whom have normal kidney function), we recommend immediate implementation of the CKD-EPI creatinine equation refit without the race variable in all laboratories in the United States because it does not include race in the calculation and reporting, included diversity in its development, is immediately available to all laboratories in the United States, and has acceptable performance characteristics and potential consequences that do not disproportionately affect any one group of individuals. (2) We recommend national efforts to facilitate increased, routine, and timely use of cystatin C, especially to confirm estimated GFR in adults who are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease, because combining filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone. If ongoing evidence supports acceptable performance, the CKD-EPI eGFR-cystatin C (eGFR cys ) and eGFR creatinine-cystatin C (eGFR cr-cys&amp;#95;R ) refit without the race variables should be adopted to provide another first-line test, in addition to confirmatory testing. (3) Research on GFR estimation with new endogenous filtration markers and on interventions to eliminate race and ethnic disparities should be encouraged and funded. An investment in science is needed for newer approaches that generate accurate, unbiased, and precise GFR measurement and estimation without the inclusion of race, and that promote health equity and do not generate disparate care.</ab>
        <ab>This unified approach, without specification of race, should be adopted across the United States. High-priority and multistakeholder efforts should implement this solution.</ab>

        <ab>In 2017, Public Health 3.0 was introduced, providing recommendations that expand traditional public department functions and programs. Operationalizing the framework requires that local health departments invest in the requisite professional skills to respond to their community's needs. The purpose of this paper is to determine the professional skills that are most important for local health departments to respond to large public health issues and challenges that are having a major impact on their communities. The study used a cross-sectional assessment of the education and training needs of local public health departments in Nebraska following the principles of practice-based systems research. The assessment was designed to assess the training and education needs of local health department staff members. The questions measured the perceived importance of and respondent's capacity across 57 core competencies for public health professionals modified from the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice. A total of 104 staff members from seven local health departments were requested to complete the assessment and 100% of the individuals responded to and completed the assessment. Twenty-eight skills were identified as the most important skills needed for local health departments. The skills were themed and categorized into four domains. (1) Data, Evaluation, and Quality Improvement, (2) Community Engagement and Facilitation, (3) Systems Thinking and Leadership, and (4) Policy and Advocacy. The results from this analysis provide direction to strengthen and transform the public health system into one that is connected, responsive, and nimble. Additionally, it also highlighted a glaring omission that Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion should be included as the fifth domain.</ab>

        <ab>Double standards are widespread throughout biomedicine, especially in research on reproductive health. One of the clearest cases of double standards involves the feminine gendering of reproductive responsibility for contraception and the continued lack of highly effective, reversible methods for cisgender men. While the biomedical establishment accepts diversity and inclusion as important social values for clinical trials, their continued use of inequitable standards undermines their ability to challenge unfair social hierarchies by developing male contraception. Thus, the gender/sex bias present in contraceptive research raises the "New Demarcation Problem": If we accept that values can and will play important roles in science, how can we nevertheless distinguish positive influences of values from more corrosive bias? I argue that biomedical researchers ought to aim their clinical trials at equity and utilize methodologies that actually achieve that aim. More specifically, I contend that we can avoid the problem of double standards by gender/sex in contraceptive research by utilizing more equitable standards. My demarcation strategy captures dynamic interplay between values and their effects, with direct policy implications for institutions conducting, funding, and evaluating clinical trials. For male contraceptive trials, this involves shifting risk assessment from an individual model to a shared model for sexual partners.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become increasingly recognized as essential to the practice of high-quality patient care delivery and the support of members of the clinical environment. A solid understanding of DEI contributes to a better grasp of what drives health care disparities and yields improved clinical outcomes for minority populations. This column discusses how individuals can practically promote DEI by describing the design and implementation of DEI in an academic psychiatry department. The authors highlight the powerful role of departmental initiatives in establishing best practices for DEI and lessons learned through the work of the psychiatry department's DEI committee.</ab>

        <ab>Recruitment of underrepresented minorities (URM) in medicine has risen to the forefront as a strategy to address health inequities, but the experiences of URM residents within their own programs are poorly understood. We describe the development and implementation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate survey at our residency program, the results of which have informed our DEI efforts.</ab>
        <ab>A resident-faculty work group collaboratively developed an 81-item questionnaire, informed by other institutional climate surveys. We administered the survey annually from 2018 through 2021 to all residents and faculty at our large academic family medicine residency program. The anonymous survey covered six key areas: general climate, climate for specific group, personal experience with discrimination and harassment, recruitment, burnout, and curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>Average response rates were 84% and 50% for residents and faculty, respectively. Survey results show low satisfaction with resident and faculty diversity; higher rates of burnout for respondents who self-identify as URM, persons of color (POC), and/or LGBTQ; and racial and gender differences in experiences of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.</ab>
        <ab>Instituting an annual internal climate survey at our residency has provided invaluable information regarding the perspectives and experiences of our residents and faculty that has informed our DEI initiatives. We envision that our survey will inform continual improvement and serve as a model for similar introspection leading to meaningful action at other programs.</ab>

        <ab>Advocacy engagement has been at the forefront of National Cancer Institute (NCI) efforts to advance scientific discoveries and transform medical interventions. Nonetheless, the journey for advocates has been uneven. Case in Point: NCI publication affiliation rules of engagement pose unique equity challenges while raising questions about structural representation in biomedical research. Abiding by the core rationale that publication affiliation should be tailored to employment status, the NCI has systematically denied research advocate volunteers the opportunity to specifically list NCI as an institutional affiliation on academic publications. Unpacking advocate NCI publication affiliation restrictions and its links with advocacy heritage preservation and convergent science goals poses unique diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges and opportunities. Improving the quality of structural representation in biomedical research requires new theories of action and flexible planning to advance, promote and build capacity for strategic advocacy inclusion and equity within publication affiliation initiatives. Here we highlight several opportunities for how leadership might formulate a radically different vision for NCI's approach. This perspective interrogates the best way forward for ensuring that biomedical employee and volunteer advocate workforce publication affiliation intersections are characterized by increased creativity and representation parity. Imbuing the scientist and clinical researcher archetype with social dimensions, we join NCI critical thinkers in urging employees, funded academics, and volunteer citizen scientists to collectively assume the role as paladins of science and integrity who view the triumphs of making a difference in science alongside the social responsibility of promoting transdisciplinary professionalism and the democratization of science.</ab>

        <ab>Global problems require global scientific solutions, but the dominance of the English language creates a large barrier for many non-English-proficient researchers to make their findings and knowledge accessible globally. Here, we propose integrating peer language proofing and translation systems in preprint platforms as a solution for promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in science.</ab>

        <ab>Recent efforts have been made by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand to encourage female inclusion in expert panels. We hypothesized that female representation on expert panels has increased over the past decade and that a directed intervention by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand would be associated with an increased percentage of submissions with female panelists.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a retrospective analysis of Instructional Course Lecture and Symposium submissions for the 2011 through 2021 American Society for Surgery of the Hand Annual Meetings. Authorship was reviewed, and the gender of the proposed authors was recorded. Additionally, the status of "all-male panel" was attributed to panels with no proposed female authors. Submissions were reviewed and compared with meeting programs to determine the status of accepted or rejected. Longitudinal analysis was performed to determine trends in the gender composition of expert panels.</ab>
        <ab>In total, 1,687 submissions were reviewed, including 1,323 Instructional Course Lectures and 364 Symposia. Female authorship constituted 18% of authorship (1,170/6,663), and lead authorship was similarly distributed, with 18% being female (296/1,687). Overall, female representation has increased steadily over the past decade, with females constituting 13% (43/332) and 20% (163/818) of the submitted authors in 2011 and 2020, respectively. Similarly, all-male panels declined from 74% (76/103) to 46% (85/185) of panels over the same timeframe. Most strikingly, a sharp increase in gender representation was observed with the directed intervention noted in the 2021 Call for Abstracts, resulting in an increase in female authorship to 26% (295/1,124) and a decline in all-male panels to 29% (70/241).</ab>
        <ab>Gender representation among hand surgery expert panels moved toward increased equity over the past decade, which has been aided by directed interventions.</ab>
        <ab>Career development and trainee decision making are impacted by gender representation; directed and intentional interventions by professional organizations are effective in encouraging greater equity and diversity within the field.</ab>

        <ab>Severe under-representation of Black women academic nurse leaders persists in United States higher education, and a major research gap still exists regarding experiences of these leaders, and facilitators of and barriers to their success. Our objective was to examine how race and gender influence how Black women academic nurse leaders' function in their leadership positions, how they are perceived by their peers, and how their perception of race, gender, class, and power influences diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the workplace. Critical race theory was used as a guiding theory, and the study design involved narrative inquiry followed by thematic analysis. Four overarching themes with four sub-themes were revealed: (a) Paying a personal price for authenticity, (b) Being the only one is hard even when you are in charge, (c) The illusion of diversity and inclusion while trying to survive, and (d) Focusing on building and sustaining diversity, equity, and inclusion. Implications for nursing education including instituting training for faculty in anti-racist pedagogy and requiring nursing programs to meet inclusivity metrics for approval and accreditation.</ab>

        <ab>Gender balance refers to the equitable treatment and access to opportunities for all genders. In order to achieve true gender balance, a variety of proactive approaches developed collaboratively, with insight from multiple perspectives, need to be implemented. With that purpose, the participation of women in professions related to radiation and radiation protection was prioritised and given high visibility by allocating a 'Women in Radiation' (WiR) Special Session at the 15th International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA), hosted by South Korea on 20 January 2021. In this session, various issues related to gender balance and equity/equality were highlighted by the panellists, and further elaborated in a subsequent discussion with attendees. The main goal of the WiR Special Session was to convene women from different organisations, career and age stages, disciplines and countries, in particular to consider the Asian-Oceanic vision and status of gender equality, along with other topics to support a 'Call for Action', with concrete recommendations subsequently provided to IRPA. The discussion stressed the main needs and challenges faced by women working in various radiation fields, along with raising awareness of possible professional and employment opportunities. This paper identifies some steps necessary to encourage, enhance and support the inclusion of more diversity in nuclear professions with specific emphasis on women. In conclusion, gender balance and equality must be at the heart of any strategic plan for the future of the radiological protection profession; international cooperation between relevant bodies is essential for success and could serve as a catalyst for specific policy statements aimed at achieving a balanced representation of women in radiological protection.</ab>

        <ab>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of macromolecules that provides both architectural support and molecular signals to cells and modulate their behaviors. Originally considered a passive mechanical structure, decades of research have since demonstrated how the ECM dynamically regulates a diverse set of cellular processes in development, homeostasis, and disease progression. In September 2021, the American Society for Matrix Biology (ASMB) organized a hybrid scientific meeting, integrating in-person and virtual formats, to discuss the latest developments in ECM research. Here, we highlight exciting scientific advances that emerged from the meeting including (1) the use of model systems for fundamental and translation ECM research, (2) ECM-targeting approaches as therapeutic modalities, (3) cell-ECM interactions, and (4) the ECM as a critical component of tissue engineering strategies. In addition, we discuss how the ASMB incorporated mentoring, career development, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in both virtual and in-person events. Finally, we reflect on the hybrid scientific conference format and how it will help the ASMB accomplish its mission moving forward.</ab>

        <ab>Improving the recruitment, retention, and leadership advancement of faculty who are under-represented in medicine is a priority at many academic institutions to ensure excellence in patient care, research, and health equity. Here we provide a critical review of the literature and offer evidence-based guidelines for faculty recruitment, retention, and representation in leadership. Recommendations for recruitment include targeted recruitment to expand the candidate pool with diverse candidates, holistic review of applications, and incentivizing stakeholders for success with diversity efforts. Retention efforts should establish a culture of inclusivity, promote faculty development, and evaluate for biases in the promotion and tenure process. We believe this guide will be valuable for all leaders and faculty members seeking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in their institutions.</ab>

        <ab>Participatory approaches to science and decision making, including stakeholder engagement, are increasingly common for managing complex socio-ecological challenges in working landscapes. However, critical questions about stakeholder engagement in this space remain. These include normative, political, and ethical questions concerning who participates, who benefits and loses, what good can be accomplished, and for what, whom, and by who. First, opportunities for addressing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion interests through engagement, while implied in key conceptual frameworks, remain underexplored in scholarly work and collaborative practice alike. A second line of inquiry relates to research-practice gaps. While both the practice of doing engagement work and scholarly research on the efficacy of engagement is on the rise, there is little concerted interplay among 'on-the-ground' practitioners and scholarly researchers. This means scientific research often misses or ignores insight grounded in practical and experiential knowledge, while practitioners are disconnected from potentially useful scientific research on stakeholder engagement. A third set of questions concerns gaps in empirical understanding of the efficacy of engagement processes and includes inquiry into how different engagement contexts and process features affect a range of behavioral, cognitive, and decision-making outcomes. Because of these gaps, a cohesive and actionable research agenda for stakeholder engagement research and practice in working landscapes remains elusive. In this review article, we present a co-produced research agenda for stakeholder engagement in working landscapes. The co-production process involved professionally facilitated and iterative dialogue among a diverse and international group of over 160 scholars and practitioners through a yearlong virtual workshop series. The resulting research agenda is organized under six cross-cutting themes: (1) Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion; (2) Ethics; (3) Research and Practice; (4) Context; (5) Process; and (6) Outcomes and Measurement. This research agenda identifies critical research needs and opportunities relevant for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. We argue that addressing these research opportunities is necessary to advance knowledge and practice of stakeholder engagement and to support more just and effective engagement processes in working landscapes.</ab>

        <ab>Health science libraries are ideally suited for proactive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, as their work and spaces transcend disciplinary boundaries. In 2018, a DEI Team was created by the Health Science Center Libraries at the University of Florida, with the purpose of improving the library's climate for its diverse patrons and employees. This article provides an overview of the Team's formation and development, including its charge, culture, structure, teamwork, leadership, and reporting processes. Recommendations are offered for other libraries seeking to establish similar committees.</ab>

        <ab>Motivated by the well-established benefits to society of artistic creation and of demographic diversity, we investigate the gender and racial/ethnic composition of influential contributors to four creative domains. Women make up 51% of the U.S. population but are underrepresented at influential levels of contemporary art (28%), high fashion (45%), box office film (27%), and popular music (17%). Marginalized racial/ethnic groups make up 39% of the U.S. population yet comprise approximately half that figure in contemporary art (22%), high fashion (22%), and box office film (19%). Black musical artists have higher representation (48%), though higher representation does not equate with equity and inclusion. As for intersecting identities, white men are overrepresented in all four domains by factors ranging from 1.4 to 2 as compared to the U.S. population, and most other gender-racial/ethnic groups are further minoritized. Our study is the first comprehensive, comparative, empirical look at intersecting identities across creative fields. The exclusion of marginalized individuals, including those who are women, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Latinx, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, is severe. The lack of self-expressed demographic data is a challenge, as is the erasure of certain identity groups from the American Community Survey, including agender, gender noncomforming, nonbinary, and transgender individuals. These are challenges that, if addressed, would enhance our collective understanding of diversity in creative fields.</ab>

        <ab>The Liaison Committee on Medical Education accreditation process is an important component of professional regulation and is used by medical schools to strengthen their medical education programs. Accreditation-related consultations with schools often include a review of relevant documents, stakeholder interviews, and mock site visits. A review by the author of this commentary of these consultations at 17 schools showed variability in how information regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was incorporated and discussed in accreditation-related materials and interviews. At all schools, DEI information emerged in materials related to the accreditation standards that specifically inquire into DEI. However, at some schools, DEI emerged more broadly across a variety of standards. These differences suggest that considering the totality of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education standards and elements may be a useful tool for enabling schools to analyze and describe their DEI efforts, consider additional ways to engage in continuous quality improvement related to DEI, and achieve institutional DEI goals. In addition, a small number of the reviewed schools appeared to have had particular success in meeting institutional DEI goals. An appreciative inquiry-informed review suggested that these exemplar schools had both area-specific and cross-functional systems focused on achieving DEI goals. In addition, senior leadership demonstrated a commitment to DEI, DEI champions were empowered, and leaders displayed legislative-style and systems leadership skills. Schools that nurture these characteristics may be better positioned to advance DEI. Scholarly evaluation of these observations is necessary.</ab>

        <ab>Robert Veatch argues that physician oaths should not be valued as substantive moral commitments, transformational rituals, or symbolic acts. Further, he insists that oath recitation in medical schools is immoral. I respond to Veatch's criticisms and argue that, with alterations to their content and practice, oaths can have value for articulating moral commitments and building a sense of moral community within the profession. I break down Veatch's multitude of objections to oaths over his career, and I suggest how medical schools can avoid the pitfalls identified by Veatch. A promising and innovative path forward is to integrate a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion-though with an understanding that a few lines in an oath are far from sufficient for institutional culture, faculty accountability, or students' education.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for surgical residency programs to rethink their methods of evaluating and recruiting candidates. However, the past year has not been seamless, with a soaring number of applications, reports of programs and applicants having difficulty evaluating each other, and an increasingly uneven distribution of interviews among applicants. Consequently, many have called for national changes to the residency application process to address these longstanding concerns.</ab>
        <ab>Here, we review the evolving literature and advocate for the permanent adoption of visiting rotations, virtual interviews with a universal release date and data-driven attendance limits, and opportunities for in-person applicant visits.</ab>
        <ab>We believe these changes leverage the strengths of each format, allow for satisfactory bidirectional evaluation, and promote principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Rapidly advancing biomedical and electronic technologies, ongoing health disparities, and new online educational modalities are all changing medicine and medical education. As medical training continues to evolve, research is increasingly critical to help improve it, but medical education research can pose unique ethical challenges. As research participants, medical trainees may face several risks and in many ways constitute a vulnerable group. In this commentary, the author examines several of the ethical challenges involved in medical education research, including confidentiality and the risk of stigma; the need for equity, diversity, and inclusion; genetic testing of students; clustered randomized trials of training programs; and questions about quality improvement activities. The author offers guidance for navigating these ethical challenges, including the importance of engaging with institutional review boards. Academic medical institutions should educate and work closely with faculty to ensure that all research adheres to appropriate ethical guidelines and regulations and should provide instruction about the ethics of medical education research to establish a strong foundation for the future of the field. Research on medical education will become increasingly important. Given the potential sensitivity of the data collected in such research, investigators must understand and address potential ethical challenges as carefully as possible.</ab>

        <ab>Canada was the first country in the world to establish multiculturalism as its official policy for the governance of diversity. Canadian multiculturalism has gained much popularity in political and public discourses in the past 50 years, and it has also received no less criticism as to its effectiveness in addressing issues of racism. There have also been ambiguities over the meaning and intention of multiculturalism, leading to divergent understandings of multiculturalism as an ideal of inclusion and equity, on the one hand, and a mere political rhetoric, on the other. On the occasion of celebrating the 50 th anniversary of Canada's official multiculturalism policy, this article re-visits Canada's multiculturalism by reviewing its history and ethos and critically examining its actual effects as manifested during the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada. The rise of anti-Asian racism, anti-Black racism, and anti-Indigenous racism incidents in the pandemic reveals that multiculturalism has in effect, sustained a racist and unequal society of Canada with racism entrenched in its history and ingrained in every aspect of its social structure. Multiculturalism tolerates cultural difference but does not challenge an unjust society premised on white supremacy. The anti-racism movement mobilized by racialized communities in Canada indicates that multiculturalism has failed to respond to racialized communities' pressing demand for social change and action for social justice. The article concludes with a proposed alternative framework to multiculturalism, that is, pandemic anti-racism education model, to centre the issue of race and racism in an action-oriented, inclusive, and empowering approach toward a future of a just society.</ab>

        <ab>Obstetricians know the statistics-1 out of every 10 babies is born premature; preeclampsia affects 1 in 25 pregnant people; the United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world. Yet, physicians and scientists still do not fully understand the biology of normal pregnancy, let alone what causes these complications. Obstetrics and gynecology-trained physician-scientists are uniquely positioned to fill critical knowledge gaps by addressing clinically-relevant problems through fundamental research and interpreting insights from basic and translational studies in the clinical context. Within our specialty, however, physician-scientists are relatively uncommon. Inadequate guidance, lack of support and community, and structural barriers deter fellows and early stage faculty from pursuing the physician-scientist track. One approach to help cultivate the next generation of physician-scientists in obstetrics and gynecology is to demystify the process and address the common barriers that contribute to the attrition of early stage investigators. Here, we review major challenges and propose potential pathways forward in the areas of mentorship, obtaining protected research time and resources, and ensuring diversity, equity, and inclusion, from our perspective as early stage investigators in maternal-fetal medicine. We discuss the roles of early stage investigators and leaders at the institutional and national level in the collective effort to retain and grow our physician-scientist workforce. We aim to provide a framework for early stage investigators initiating their research careers and a starting point for discussion with academic stakeholders. We cannot afford to lose the valuable contributions of talented individuals due to modifiable factors or forfeit our voices as advocates for the issues that impact pregnant populations.</ab>

        <ab>Because of gaps in the offerings of Library and Information Science programs and librarian continuing education programs, library students and early-career librarians may not be aware of opportunities in health sciences librarianship. There is a need for introductory educational offerings on the foundations of health sciences librarianship. There is also a need to address barriers that may obstruct members of underrepresented groups from becoming health sciences librarians. The article explores the possibility that online education and mentoring can address gaps in introductory educational offerings in health sciences librarianship. The article describes the development of a pilot program for an online Introduction to Health Sciences Librarianship course and mentoring program, reflects on results from a survey of program participants, and identifies areas for further research and program development. The article also discusses the potential implications the program may have for addressing equity, diversity, and inclusion in health sciences librarianship.</ab>

        <ab>Prevention and early intervention programs have been initiated worldwide to serve youth at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P), who are adolescents and young adults experiencing subclinical psychosis and functional impairment. The primary goals of these efforts are to prevent or mitigate the onset of clinical psychosis, while also treating comorbid issues. It is important to consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in CHR-P work, especially as these programs continue to proliferate around the world. Further, there is a long history in psychiatry of misdiagnosing and mistreating psychosis in individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Although there have been significant developments in early intervention psychosis work, there is evidence that marginalized groups are underserved by current CHR-P screening and intervention efforts. These issues are compounded by the contexts of continued social marginalization and significant mental health disparities in general child/adolescent services. Within this narrative review and call to action, we use an intersectional and minority stress lens to review and discuss current issues related to equity in CHR-P services, offer evidence-based recommendations, and propose next steps. In particular, our intersectional and minority stress lenses incorporate perspectives for a range of marginalized and underserved identities related to race, ethnicity, and culture; faith; immigration status; geography/residence; gender identity; sexual orientation; socioeconomic status/class; and ability status.</ab>

        <ab>Accreditation standards in medical education require curricular elements dedicated to understanding diversity and addressing inequities in health care. The development and implementation of culturally effective care curricula are crucial to improving health care outcomes, yet these curricular elements are currently limited in residency training.</ab>
        <ab>A needs assessment of 125 pediatric residents was conducted that revealed minimal prior culturally effective care instruction. To address identified needs, an integrated, longitudinal equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) curriculum was designed and implemented at a single institution using Kern's Framework. This consisted of approximately 25 h of instruction including monthly didactics and sessions which addressed (1) EDI definitions and history and (2) microaggressions. A mixed methods evaluation was used to assess the curricular elements with quantitative summary of resident session scores and a qualitative component using in-depth content analysis of resident evaluations. Thematic analysis was used to code qualitative responses and identify common attitudes and perceptions about the curricular content.</ab>
        <ab>109/125 (87.2%) residents completed the needs assessment. Over one year, 323 resident evaluations were collected for curricular sessions. Average overall quality rating for sessions was 4.7 (scale 1-5), and 85% of comments included positive feedback. Key themes included lecture topic relevance, adequate time to cover the content, need for screening tools and patient resources, importance of patient case examples to supplement instruction, and novel/ "eye opening" content. In addition, several broader institutional impacts of the curriculum were noted such as recognizing the need for comprehensive support for residents of color, corresponding EDI faculty training, and a resident reporting system to identify learning climate issues.</ab>
        <ab>The implementation of a comprehensive resident EDI curriculum was feasible earning positive evaluations in its first year, with requests for additional content. It has also spurred multiple institution-wide ripple effects. Suggestions for improvement included more case-based learning, skills practice, and simulation. Future steps include expansion of this EDI curriculum to faculty and examining its impact in resident of color affinity groups. Given ACGME requirements to improve training addressing equity and social determinants of health, this curriculum development process serves as a possible template for other training programs.</ab>

        <ab>Black individuals are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2016, Black students earned 9% of science and 4% of engineering bachelor's degrees compared to a total of 56% of science and engineering bachelor's degrees earned by White students. Even with similar entering rates, Black students leave STEM majors at 1.4 times the rate of White students. These data reflect the manifestation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) barriers faced by Black students and scientists to successfully navigate higher education and pursue careers in STEM fields. There remains a critical need to develop better ways to recruit, retain, train, and graduate Black students in STEM, especially within predominantly White institutions. Biomechanics is a growing interdisciplinary and translational STEM field where DEI barriers persist. Thus, the Black Biomechanists Association (BBA) was founded in 2020 with intentions to reduce these barriers and give much needed support to Black students and biomechanists in STEM spaces. The organization's mission is to uplift and enrich Black biomechanists in their academic and professional careers. Our objectives to achieve this mission provide a supportive environment and resources to address the challenges, needs, and interests of Black biomechanists, as well as aid in the biomechanics community's efforts to achieve DEI. In two short years, BBA has developed a needs-based mentoring program, hosted professional development and culturally-competent mentoring workshops, and produced communications to educate the biomechanics community and broader audience on culturally-relevant topics that impact Black biomechanists. The purpose of this article is to share the work and impact of BBA to date.</ab>

        <ab>Universities, the sites for objective knowledge, apolitical and legitimized to contribute to human and intellectual capacity, find themselves in a tenuous position on issues of merit, equality, and fairness. On one hand, social forces have demonstrated how universities have been institutions for the production and reproduction of systemic inequality. On the other hand, universities maintain that they are well positioned, as part of their institutional renewal practices, to address contemporary calls for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Since universities are now eager to embrace EDI principles, it is appropriate to demonstrate their historical failures and provide some recommendations towards institutional renewal. Drawing on critical pedagogy, the paper examines selected academic contributions and knowledge claims that have reproduced systemic inequality, specifically on the discourse on human classification. The broader question is whether universities are simply going through the motions and hope EDI is a fad or are serious about institutional renewal and transformative changes. The study offers some ideas on how universities can pursue transformative changes grounded on EDI principles.</ab>

        <ab>Disability competencies were included, for the first time, in India's new undergraduate competency-based curriculum as a result of physician-led advocacy in 2019; the regulatory body also recommended the use of the humanities in medicine.</ab>
        <ab>To use tools from the health humanities to impart disability competencies and help students appreciate the social and human rights issues associated with disability.</ab>
        <ab>A module was developed and piloted in the foundation course on the new cohort of students. The tools included storytelling, visual art, poetry, narratives, and Forum Theatre; many facilitators were doctors and patients with disabilities. Learners were introduced to the concept of universal design through a field visit. Quantitative and open-ended feedback was taken from learners after module delivery; reflections were sought after four months.</ab>
        <ab>The data revealed that the humanities tools used in the module had the potential to help learners explore struggle and oppression and to expose discriminatory attitudes. Learners were able to think beyond the hegemony of normalcy, and show an understanding of diversity, dignity, autonomy, disableism, social inclusion, equity, and universal design. They admitted to the misconceptions they carried and showed keenness to advocate for change.</ab>
        <ab>This study piloted a novel disability competencies module using tools from the health humanities and found that learners were able to engage with and show an understanding of the social and human rights issues associated with disability. Conversations by, for, and with people with disabilities must be part of such interventions in developing and delivering disability courses.</ab>

        <ab>Gender diversity in medicine continues to be a critical topic, and gender diversity within surgical fields remains an overarching challenge. In the following review, we objectively address the data available in terms of training slots for women in general and vascular surgery and within the vascular surgery workforce. Overall, women comprise 36% of active physicians in the 2019 Association of American Medical Colleges data. The number of women in surgical fields is lower representing 22% in general surgery, 9% in neurosurgery, 6% in orthopedic surgery, 17% in plastic surgery, 8% in thoracic surgery, and 15% in vascular surgery. Also notable is the lower academic ranks held by women in surgery. The proportion of women instructors in surgery in 2020 was 61%, assistant professors 30%, associate professors 23%, and full-time professors only 13.5%. There are multiple opportunities across the divisional/institutional/societal domains in which mentorship and sponsorship can promote gender equity and inclusion. Recruitment and retention of women and minorities into the vascular academic and private practices is essential to ensure best patient outcomes and quality of care for our patients. We hope that by shedding light on this topic, there will be greater awareness and improved strategies to address the disparities within institutions.</ab>

        <ab>Graduate school applications in Biomedical Engineering (BME) are steadily rising, making competition stiffer, applications more complex, and reviews more resource intensive. Holistic reviews are being increasingly adopted to support increased diversity, equity, and inclusion in graduate student BME admissions, but which application metrics are the strongest predictors of admission and enrollment into BME programs remains unclear. In this perspectives article, we aim to shed light on some of the key predictors of student acceptance in graduate school. We share data from a three-year retrospective review of our own institution's graduate BME applications and admission rates and review the influence of grade point averages (GPA), standardized test scores (e.g., GRE), and prior research experience on graduate school admission rates. We also examine how the waiver of GRE requirements has changed the landscape of BME graduate applications in recent years. Finally, we discuss efforts taken by our institution and others to develop and implement holistic reviews of graduate applications that encourage students from underrepresented backgrounds to apply and successfully gain admission to graduate school. We share five key lessons we learned by performing the retrospective review and encourage other institutions to " self-reflect " and examine their historical graduate admissions data and past practices. Efforts aimed at engaging faculty to overcome their own implicit biases, engaging with underrepresented students in hands-on, research-intensive programs, and networking with diverse student populations have strong potential to enhance the diversity of BME graduate programs and our STEM workforce.</ab>

        <ab>This article seeks to better understand how radiology residency programs leverage their social media presences during the 2020 National Residency Match Program (NRMP) application cycle to engage with students and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion to prospective residency applicants.</ab>
        <ab>We used publicly available information to determine how broad a presence radiology programs have across specific platforms (Twitter [Twitter, Inc, San Francisco, California], Facebook [Facebook, Inc, Menlo Park, California], Instagram [Facebook, Inc], and website pages) as well as what strategies these programs use to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>During the 2020 NRMP application cycle, radiology residency programs substantially increased their social media presence across the platforms we examined. We determined that 29.3% (39 of 133), 58.9% (43 of 73), and 29.55% (13 of 44) of programs used Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, respectively; these accounts were established after an April 1, 2020, advisory statement from the NRMP. Program size and university affiliation were correlated with the degree of social media presence. Those programs using social media to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion used a broad but similar approach across programs and platforms.</ab>
        <ab>The events of 2020 expedited the growth of social media among radiology residency programs, which subsequently ushered in a new medium for conversations about representation in medicine. However, the effectiveness of this medium to promote meaningful expansion of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of radiology remains to be seen.</ab>

        <ab>Equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic radiology are a work in progress and although the gender gap has decreased, there remains a paucity of studies examining female representation among radiology trainees over the past decade.</ab>
        <ab>The aim of our undertaking was to evaluate gender parity in United States (US) and Canadian radiology residency programs and to suggest future directions to improve female representation MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of publicly available data on radiology residents from the US and Canada was performed from 2007to 2019. Data on diagnostic radiology residents was collected from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for the US and the Canadian Post M.D. Education Registry for Canada. Statistical tests including regression and ANOVA were used to study the gender proportions from 2007to 2019.</ab>
        <ab>There has been little progress in bridging the gender gap in the last 12 years. The proportion of female residents pursuing radiology has remained at an average of 26.74% (n = 1,238of 4,629) in US programs and 31.78% (n = 28 of88) in Canadian programs. The average change in the percentage of female residents was 0.0% per year (P = 0.0) for US programs and -2.9% per year (P = 0.3) for Canadian programs.</ab>
        <ab>Despite a higher proportion of females in North American medical schools, gender disparity persists among radiology residents. More research is needed to identify barriers limiting female representation and improve gender parity across North American radiology programs.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for flexible arrangements, including asynchronous work and working from home. These arrangements may be necessary to comply with public health directives and are manageable when few other options exist. It can be difficult to lead in an environment when team members have divergent core working hours and are not available for collaboration. This can be compounded by the perception of inequitable treatment of employee needs or preferences by management, which can further strain team dynamics. As the pandemic eases, it may be difficult for all employees to revert to a fully on-site arrangement; some may be unable and others unwilling. Leaders will need to consider ethical issues in reaching organizational goals in this new reality. Equity, diversity, and inclusion principles will be critical when balancing the needs of the individual and the team. Supportive arrangements and a culture of inclusion will be key to retaining top talent.</ab>

        <ab>To characterize and compare fourth-year students of US veterinary schools graduating with and without related educational debt (ie, DVM debt) from 2001 through 2020.</ab>
        <ab>45,756 fourth-year veterinary students who participated in the annual AVMA Senior Survey from 2001 through 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Survey data were summarized for variables hypothesized to be associated with DVM debt. Multivariable modeling was used to investigate associations between these variables and the likelihood of graduating with DVM debt.</ab>
        <ab>Mean DVM debt increased fairly steadily from $56,824 in 2001 (n = 1,587) to $157,146 in 2020 (2,859). Of 45,756 students, 6,129 (13.4%) had no DVM debt. Attending Tuskegee University and having children (both men and women) were associated with an increased likelihood of DVM debt. Attending certain other veterinary schools and more recent survey year were associated with a decreased likelihood. For 2020, the likelihood of DVM debt decreased with increasing percentage of tuition paid by family and increased with increasing percentage of tuition paid by educational loans, being a woman with children, and increasing total cost of attendance. No association was found with state cost of living index or per capita income.</ab>
        <ab>Results suggested a growing rift between US veterinary students who cannot afford tuition and fees without accumulating financially concerning levels of debt and those who have the financial ability or family situation to fully fund veterinary school. Efforts should be undertaken to recruit across socioeconomic statuses and provide meaningful scholarships to students with greatest financial needs to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in veterinary medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Equity in the promotion of women and underrepresented minorities (URiM) is essential for the advancement of academic emergency medicine and the specialty as a whole. Forward-thinking healthcare organizations can best position themselves to optimally care for an increasingly diverse patient population and mentor trainees by championing increased diversity in senior faculty ranks, leadership, and governance roles. This article explores several potential solutions to addressing inequities that hinder the advancement of women and URiM faculty. It is intended to complement the recently approved American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) policy statement aimed at overcoming barriers to promotion of women and URiM faculty in academic emergency medicine. This policy statement was jointly released and supported by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM), and the Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine (AACEM).</ab>

        <ab>Diversity in the nursing workforce is an important driver of patient satisfaction, adherence to care, and quality outcomes. Systemic barriers exist that prevent individuals from underrepresented minority groups entering and advancing in the nursing workforce. To advance the health of the community we serve and with grant support from the Health Resources and Services Administration, we developed a postgraduate advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) fellowship in community health. This program is a partnership between a federally qualified health center and a college of nursing. We developed a deliberate plan to recruit and admit diverse applicants who would continue to practice in our community at the conclusion of their fellowship year. Using targeted recruitment outreach, we identified new-graduate APRNs who were representative of the community we serve. Using holistic review methodology, we interviewed applicants with explicit efforts to mitigate the effects of bias towards race, ethnicity, gender, and academic affiliation. We embraced a quality-improvement ethos that enabled evolution and growth with each iteration of the program. Understanding that intention does not translate to outcomes, we undertook ongoing critique of our methods and engaged diverse resources to improve our processes. Over two admission cycles, our fellowship in community health for new graduate APRNs has demonstrated improvements in strategies to diversify the community health workforce. We will describe our process of nonjudgmental self-critique and a quality-improvement framework that can serve as a strategy to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the community health workforce.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed racism as a public health crisis embedded in structural processes. Editors of surgical research journals pledged their commitment to improve structure and process through increasing diversity in the peer review and editorial process; however, little benchmarking data are available.</ab>
        <ab>A survey of editorial board members from high impact surgical research journals captured self-identified demographics. Analysis of manuscript submissions from 2016 to 2020 compared acceptance for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-focused manuscripts to overall rates.</ab>
        <ab>25.6% of respondents were female, 2.9% Black, and 3.3% Hispanic. There was variation in the diversity among journals and in the proportion of DEI submissions they attract, but no clear correlation between DEI acceptance rates and board diversity.</ab>
        <ab>Diversity among board members reflects underrepresentation of minorities seen among surgeons nationally. Recruitment and retention of younger individuals, representing more diverse backgrounds, may be a strategy for change. DEI publication rates may benefit from calls for increasing DEI scholarship more so than changes to the peer review process.</ab>

        <ab>Canada desperately needs more doctoral graduates. We also need more diverse graduates to move into education and leadership roles across the country. This article examines the origins and development of doctoral education for nurses in Canada and the continuing dire shortfall of doctorally prepared nurses to meet the expanding needs of the profession. In the context of this desperate shortage, this article then moves to examine the critical issues of equity, diversity and inclusion and the failure of the nursing academy and the profession to address these long-standing matters. These two issues - the shortfall of doctoral graduates and the lack of diversity in education and leadership in nursing - need to be addressed through a combined and focused strategy if we are to ensure the future sustainability of the profession. Given the decade-long lead time required to effect significant changes in doctoral graduations, the article concludes with a call for a national strategy engaging multiple stakeholders to increase awareness of the issues and their implications for the sustainability of the profession. It concludes that only through the united efforts of the profession will Canadian nursing be able to ensure that nursing education will produce a sufficient number of graduates for the needs of education, practice and policy across the country and that these graduates will better reflect the diversity of the nursing profession and the Canadian population, overall.</ab>

        <ab>The 2019-2020 academic year was unprecedented, with navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and meaningfully engaging with the causes and consequences of long-standing racism and social injustice in the United States. In this article, the authors, all former chief residents, reflect on how they carried out their role during this last year using an approach that was grounded in equity and justice. They describe a framework based on their experiences, including setting the tone and culture of the residency program; providing medical education, teaching, and feedback; advocating for resident well-being and inclusion; participating in quality improvement and hospital policymaking; and partnering for institutional change. They end with a call to action to reconceptualize the role of the chief resident to include the genuine work of diversity, equity, and inclusion to ensure a more equitable future.</ab>

        <ab>Trust in American health care and in the people running medical institutions is in decline, which poses a threat to the physician-patient relationship. In response, the ABIM Foundation has established the Building Trust initiative, which includes the Trust Practices Network, advancing research in trust, leadership convening, and various communications vehicles. The Trust Practices Network includes hospitals and health systems, specialty societies, health plans, consumer organizations, employers, and others who are working to reaffirm and strengthen trust as a pillar in their own missions. Participants offer examples of how they have built trust, and their contributions have illuminated 4 dimensions of trust: competency, caring, communication, and comfort. This commentary discusses an exemplary practice for each of these dimensions and describes the "positive deviance" strategy that underlies the Trust Practices Network.

        <ab>In response to a national call for re-evaluation of the use of race in clinical algorithms, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) established a Task Force to reassess inclusion of race in the estimation of GFR in the United States and its implications for diagnosis and management of patients with, or at risk for, kidney diseases.</ab>
        <ab>The Task Force organized its activities over 10 months in phases to ( 1 ) clarify the problem and evidence regarding eGFR equations in the United States (described previously in an interim report), and, in this final report, ( 2 ) evaluate approaches to address use of race in GFR estimation, and ( 3 ) provide recommendations. We identified 26 approaches for the estimation of GFR that did or did not consider race and narrowed our focus, by consensus, to five of those approaches. We holistically evaluated each approach considering six attributes: assay availability and standardization; implementation; population diversity in equation development; performance compared with measured GFR; consequences to clinical care, population tracking, and research; and patient centeredness. To arrive at a unifying approach to estimate GFR, we integrated information and evidence from many sources in assessing strengths and weaknesses in attributes for each approach, recognizing the number of Black and non-Black adults affected.</ab>
        <ab>( 1 ) For US adults (&gt;85% of whom have normal kidney function), we recommend immediate implementation of the CKD-EPI creatinine equation refit without the race variable in all laboratories in the United States because it does not include race in the calculation and reporting, included diversity in its development, is immediately available to all laboratories in the United States, and has acceptable performance characteristics and potential consequences that do not disproportionately affect any one group of individuals. ( 2 ) We recommend national efforts to facilitate increased, routine, and timely use of cystatin C, especially to confirm eGFR in adults who are at risk for or have CKD, because combining filtration markers (creatinine and cystatin C) is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone. If ongoing evidence supports acceptable performance, the CKD-EPI eGFR-cystatin C (eGFRcys) and eGFR creatinine-cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys&amp;#95;R) refit without the race variables should be adopted to provide another first-line test, in addition to confirmatory testing. ( 3 ) Research on GFR estimation with new endogenous filtration markers and on interventions to eliminate race and ethnic disparities should be encouraged and funded. An investment in science is needed for newer approaches that generate accurate, unbiased, and precise GFR measurement and estimation without the inclusion of race, and that promote health equity and do not generate disparate care.</ab>
        <ab>This unified approach, without specification of race, should be adopted across the United States. High-priority and multistakeholder efforts should implement this solution.</ab>

        <ab>Early-career female faculty, both physician scientists and basic researchers, have disproportionately experienced negative professional, financial, and personal consequences associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This career phase represents a critical time for establishing a network of mentors and collaborators, demonstrating professional independence, and balancing new teaching, research, and service duties while simultaneously navigating personal and familial responsibilities. Persistent gender inequality perpetuated by adherence to traditional gender roles place early-career women faculty at a further disadvantage. Women in academic medicine and research do not attain promotion, leadership positions, and other established markers of success at the same rate as their male counterparts. This disparity was the impetus for the creation of a Recruitment and Retention action group within the Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMN). This perspective piece is written from the viewpoint of a group of female-identifying early-career faculty participating in a career development program for early-stage and newly appointed faculty at UMN, sponsored by the Recruitment and Retention CWIMS action group and our Office of Faculty Affairs. We describe areas of stress exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: work, financial, and work-life well-being, and propose an adapted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) model to guide the response to future challenges within a faculty competency framework. We offer recommendations based on the DEI-competency framework, including opportunities for lasting positive change that can emerge from this challenging moment of our collective history.</ab>

        <ab>It's been 50 years since Women in Cell Biology (WICB) was founded by junior women cell biologists who found themselves neither represented at the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) presentations nor receiving the information, mentoring, and sponsorship they needed to advance their careers. Since then, gender parity at ASCB has made significant strides: WICB has become a standing ASCB committee, women are regularly elected president of the ASCB, and half the symposia speakers are women. Many of WICB's pioneering initiatives for professional development, including career panels, workshops, awards for accomplishments in science and mentoring, and career mentoring roundtables, have been incorporated and adapted into broader "professional development" that benefits all members of ASCB. The time has passed when we can assume that all women benefit equally from progress. By strategically, thoughtfully, and honestly recognizing the challenges to women of the past and today, we may anticipate those new challenges that will arise in the next 50 years. WICB, in collaboration with the ASCB, can lead in data collection and access and can promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This work will be a fitting homage to the women who, half a century ago, posted bathroom stall invitations to the first Women in Cell Biology meetup.</ab>

        <ab>Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) represent ethnic diversity, gender diversity, and generational diversity within a marginalized workforce. Their advancement to the baccalaureate nursing degree (BSN) may enhance delivery of culturally relevant patient care and reduce disparity in health care. Based on Knowles Andragogy in Practice model, we created a self-paced, individualized educational pathway with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion to address their needs. Dotting the I's (idea, implementation, innovation, inclusion, improvement) illustrates track/curriculum development, whereas crossing the T's (time, travel, tuition, transition, technology, touchstones) alleviates student burdens. The elements are interwoven into the LPN-to-BSN transition journey model, as aligned with core and subcore concepts of transitioning. [ J Contin Educ Nurs . 2021;52(12):558-564.] .</ab>

        <ab>Obesity is a chronic disease that disproportionately affects individuals from nonmajority racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Research shows that individuals from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds consider it important to have access to providers from diverse backgrounds. Health care providers and scientists from minority racial/ethnic groups are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to treat or conduct research on patients from underrepresented groups.</ab>
        <ab>To characterize the racial/ethnic diversity of nutrition- and obesity-focused professional organizations in the United States.</ab>
        <ab>This study assessed race/ethnicity data from several obesity-focused national organizations including The Obesity Society, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the American Society for Nutrition, and the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM). Each organization was queried via emailed survey to provide data on racial/ethnic representation among their membership in the past 5 y and among elected presidents from 2010 to 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Two of the 3 professional societies queried did not systematically track race/ethnicity data at the time of query. Limited tracking data available from AND show underrepresentation of black (2.6%), Asian (3.9%), Latinx (3.1%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander: (1.3%), or indigenous (American Indian or Alaskan Native: 0.3%) individuals compared with the US population. Underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities was also reported for ABOM diplomates (black: 6.0%, Latinx: 5.0%, Native American: 0.2%). Only AND reported having racial/ethnic diversity (20%) among the organization's presidents within the previous decade (2010-2020).</ab>
        <ab>Findings suggest that 1) standardized tracking of race and ethnicity data is needed to fully assess diversity, equity, and inclusion, and 2) work is needed to increase the diversity of membership and leadership at the presidential level within obesity- and nutrition-focused professional organizations. A diverse cadre of obesity- and nutrition-focused health care professionals is needed to further improve nutrition-related health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and undernutrition, in this country.</ab>

        <ab>Experts have an obligation to make difficult decisions rather than offloading these decisions onto others who may be less well equipped to make them. This commentary considers this obligation through the lens of drafting critical care rationing protocols to address COVID-19-induced scarcity. The author recalls her own experience as a member of multiple groups charged with the generation of protocols for how hospitals and states should ration critical care resources like ventilators and intensive care unit beds, in the event that there would not be enough to go around as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified. She identifies several obvious lessons learned through this process, including the need to combat the pervasive effects of racism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination; to enhance the diversity, equity, and inclusion built into the process of drafting rationing protocols; and to embrace transparency, including acknowledging failings and fallibility. She also comes to a more complicated conclusion: Individuals in a position of authority, such as medical ethicists, have a moral obligation to embrace assertion, even when such assertions may well turn out to be wrong. She notes that when the decision-making process is grounded in legitimacy, medical ethics must have the moral courage to embrace fallibility.</ab>

        <ab>In this paper, we provide a critique focused on the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Standards for Single-Case Research Design (Standards 4.1). Specifically, we (a) recommend the use of visual-analysis to verify a single-case intervention study's design standards and to examine the study's operational issues, (b) identify limitations of the design-comparable effect-size measure and discuss related statistical matters, (c) review the applicability and practicality of Standards 4.1 to single-case designs (SCDs), and (d) recommend inclusion of content pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion in future standards. Within the historical context of the WWC Pilot Standards for Single-Case Design (1.0), we suggest that Standards 4.1 may best serve as standards for meta-analyses of SCDs but will need to make clear distinctions among the various types of SCD studies that are included in any research synthesis. In this regard, we argue for transparency in SCD studies that meet design standards and those that do not meet design standards in any meta-analysis emanating from the WWC. The intent of these recommendations is to advance the science of SCD research both in research synthesis and in promoting evidence-based practices.</ab>

        <ab>The University of California San Francisco Neurology Department incorporated a formal diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum into the residency education in 2015. During that time, we have learned a number of lessons that can be useful to other institutions planning similar initiatives including the following: (1) training should be led by a multidisciplinary team with experienced educators, (2) sustainability of the curriculum requires broad departmental buy-in from leadership to junior faculty to the residents themselves, (3) the curriculum needs to balance training on fundamental topics with flexibility to change in response to current events and the needs of the community, and (4) the sessions need to be practical.</ab>

        <ab>Breastfeeding has medical and economic benefits and providing an environment supportive of breastfeeding should be a priority in radiology to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Most breastfeeding radiologists do not meet their breastfeeding goals and inadequate time for pumping is the most commonly cited barrier. The UCSF lactation credit model sets the standard for breastfeeding support in medicine by providing protected time without productivity penalties and it should be adapted and implemented across radiology practices to more fully support breastfeeding radiologists and radiation oncologists.</ab>

        <ab>Academic medicine needs more diverse leadership from racial/ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ physicians. Longitudinal structural support programs that bring together underrepresented in medicine (UiM) and non-UiM trainees are one approach to build leadership and scholarship capacity in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</ab>
        <ab>To describe the creation, satisfaction with, and feasibility of a Leadership Education in Advancing Diversity (LEAD) Program and evaluate scholars' changes in self-efficacy, intended and actual behavior change, and outputs in leadership and DEI scholarship.</ab>
        <ab>In 2017, we created the LEAD Program, a 10-month longitudinal, single institution program that provides residents and fellows ("scholars") across graduate medical education (GME) with leadership training and mentorship in creating DEI-focused scholarship. In the first 3 cohorts (2017-2020), we assessed scholars' self-efficacy, actual and planned behavior change, and program satisfaction using IRB-approved, de-identified retrospective pre-/post-surveys. We measured scholarship as the number of workshops presented and publications developed by the LEAD scholars. We used descriptive statistics and paired 2-tailed t tests to analyze the data.</ab>
        <ab>Seventy-five trainees completed LEAD; 99% (74 of 75) completed the retrospective pre-/post-surveys. There was statistically significant improvement in scholars' self-efficacy for all learning objectives. All trainees thought LEAD should continue. LEAD scholars have created workshops and presented at local, regional, and national conferences, as well published their findings. Scholars identified the greatest benefits as mentorship, developing friendships with UiM and ally peers outside of their subspecialty, and confidence in public speaking.</ab>
        <ab>LEAD is an innovative, feasible GME-wide model to improve resident and fellow self-efficacy and behaviors in DEI scholarship and leadership.</ab>

        <ab>Transformative learning (TL) is an educational theory focused on deep fundamental shifts in an individual's worldview. Such shifts are well known to occur within graduate medical education (GME). However, TL in GME has yet to be formally explored.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a scoping review of the literature on TL within GME to identify areas where trainees currently experience or have potential to experience TL, and to explore areas where fostering TL has been used as a pedagogical tool.</ab>
        <ab>In January 2020, we searched 7 databases to identify literature on TL in GME. Additional articles were identified by hand-searching the Journal of Graduate Medical Education .</ab>
        <ab>A total of 956 articles were identified through database search with 3 unique articles found via hand-searching. Abstracts and manuscripts were screened by 2 authors and disagreements arbitrated by a third, yielding 28 articles for our analysis. The main components of TL (disorienting dilemma, reflection, discourse, action) took various forms. TL was closely linked with professionalism training and professional identity formation. Training programs in primary care fields were most frequently referenced. Often, trainees were experiencing TL without recognition of the theory by their educators. Gaps in the graduate medical education literature exist pertaining to TL in venues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>Our scoping review uncovered the following themes: TL and professionalism, TL and primary care, and TL by other names. TL is likely occurring but going unrecognized in some settings.</ab>

        <ab>Mental health applications or apps are a promising approach to reduce the pervasive unmet mental health need observed among marginalized groups. However, these groups face unique challenges to engage in and benefit from these interventions, and apps that consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) may be better positioned to reach them. App evaluation frameworks emerge as crucial tools for researchers, clinicians, and users to select evidence-based apps. Nevertheless, it is unclear the extent to which existing assessment tools capture DEI factors. The present scoping review identified 68 studies that employed one or more assessment tools to evaluate a mental health app, leading to 44 unique app evaluation frameworks. Results showed that most frameworks were developed after 2015, and only 58% of them considered at least one DEI criterion. Frameworks that performed exceptionally well were those that combined multiple standardized and validated measures. This lack of consideration for DEI variables may limit the ability of app-based interventions to serve marginalized communities, or even worse, create new disparities. Therefore, we provide recommendations to improve current app evaluation frameworks' cultural robustness and clinical utility, maximizing their effectiveness when working with individuals from marginalized communities.</ab>

        <ab>State health rankings, national nursing education reform, and increasing awareness of social injustices propelled a college of nursing to transform its strategic plan, infrastructure, and curriculum. The prevalence of social determinants of health (SDOH) in South Carolina indicates a need for the state's health workforce to understand the impact of SDOH and recognize strategies to address and ameliorate SDOH. With the paradigmatic integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion in nursing education, there is a need for programmatic and curricular integration of SDOH to increase awareness, foster understanding, and transform perspectives among nursing faculty, staff, and students.</ab>
        <ab>Institutional changes were made to improve inclusive excellence, and the evolutionary process is described.</ab>
        <ab>SDOH-rich resources and experiential learning have been integrated across a college of nursing.</ab>
        <ab>This journey is ongoing and essential for preparing nurses to advance patient advocacy, health equity, and social justice for diverse populations. [ J Nurs Educ . 2021;60(12):703-706.] .</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, inclusion, and equity are recognized as educational priorities and strategies for excellence across medical education. However, an inadvertent consequence of this push for best practice is that these terms are used interchangeably. This personal view intends to highlight the importance of language in an office of diversity and how it can potentially exacerbate the disparities it aims to alleviate. While a diversity office promotes the importance of individual differences, in definition , an office of "Diversity and Inclusion" focuses on creating a culture of respect, value, and belonging for all. On the other hand, an office of "Diversity and Equity" focuses on addressing the unique barriers that disadvantage a subset of students and faculty. This has important implications for students, faculty, staff, and administration. Moreover, this directly affects the perceptions of an institutions' diversity climate.</ab>

        <ab>Individuals experiencing chronic illnesses face many physical, emotional, and social strains as a result of their illnesses, all the while trying to navigate unfamiliar territory in the healthcare system. Navigation is a strategy that can help people facing complex care needs and barriers to care in finding and accessing needed supports in the health care system. Navigators provide a patient-centred service, guiding individuals through their care plans and overcoming barriers to care. Navigation supports for individuals experiencing complex care needs have shown significant promise and have been gaining traction across Canada.</ab>
        <ab>The Canadian Healthcare Navigation Conference was the first event of its kind in Canada to bring together navigation researchers, service providers, students, decision makers, and individuals with lived experience to share lessons learned, promising practices, and research findings. This event was co-hosted by the Family Navigation Project at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and NaviCare/SoinsNavi at the University of New Brunswick, and took place virtually on April 15-16, 2021.</ab>
        <ab>This event spanned two days, which both began with a keynote address, one from a researcher and medical professional in navigation, and another from an individual with lived experience involved in advocacy in Canadian healthcare. Concurrent oral presentations by a variety of presenters were held following each keynote presentation. A poster session was held at the end of the first day, and a panel presentation rounded out the second day. Concurrent and poster presentations covered a range of topics pertaining to approaches to navigation, navigator roles, evaluation and quality improvement, lived experience in navigation, and navigation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The panel presentation focused on identifying how the navigation field has progressed in Canada and identifying crucial next steps in navigation. These next steps were determined to be: 1) agreement on navigation-related definitions, 2) regulation and training, 3) equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, 4) integrating lived experience, and 5) regional coordination.</ab>
        <ab>This conference was an important first step to creating a shared national conversation about navigation services so that we can continue to develop, implement, and share best evidence and practices in the field.</ab>

        <ab>In 2016, 10 universities launched a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) aimed at increasing the number of scholars from Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) populations entering science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty careers. NICs bring together stakeholders focused on a common goal to accelerate innovation through structured, ongoing intervention development, implementation, and refinement. We theorized a NIC organizational structure would aid understandings of a complex problem in different contexts and accelerate opportunities to develop and improve interventions to address the problem. A distinctive feature of this NIC is its diverse institutional composition of public and private, predominantly white institutions, a historically Black university, a Hispanic-serving institution, and land grant institutions located across eight states and Washington, DC, United States. NIC members hold different positions within their institutions and have access to varied levers of change. Among the many lessons learned through this community case study, analyzing and addressing failed strategies is as equally important to a healthy NIC as is sharing learning from successful interventions. We initially relied on pre-existing relationships and assumptions about how we would work together, rather than making explicit how the NIC would develop, establish norms, understand common processes, and manage changing relationships. We had varied understandings of the depth of campus differences, sometimes resulting in frustrations about the disparate progress on goals. NIC structures require significant engagement with the group, often more intensive than traditional multi-institution organizational structures. They require time to develop and ongoing maintenance in order to advance the work. We continue to reevaluate our model for leadership, climate, diversity, conflict resolution, engagement, decision-making, roles, and data, leading to increased investment in the success of all NIC institutions. Our NIC has evolved from the traditional NIC model to become the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) AGEP NIC model with five key characteristics: (1) A well-specified aim, (2) An understanding of systems, including a variety of contexts and different organizations, (3) A culture and practice of shared leadership and inclusivity, (4) The use of data reflecting different institutional contexts, and (5) The ability to accelerate infrastructure and interventions. We conclude with recommendations for those considering developing a NIC to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.</ab>

        <ab>Gender and racial disparity is prevalent in all surgical subspecialties with women and racial groups historically underrepresented in academic plastic surgery. This study evaluated gender and racial profiles of academic plastic surgery faculty in North America and correlated both with research productivity and its effect on academic ranks of faculty in plastic surgery.</ab>
        <ab>In this cross-sectional study, we compiled a list of accredited medical schools that offer plastic surgery training for residency. Data were collected on demographics, academic rank, and research output using the Doximity, LinkedIn, and Scopus databases. Data analyses were performed with a Mann-Whitney U test and a Kruskal-Wallis test.</ab>
        <ab>Women who were black, indigenous, and/or other color occupied only 6.25% of plastic surgery faculty leadership positions in North America. There are more women and underrepresented minorities in leadership positions in Canada, when compared with the USA, relative to each country's demographic. In both countries, women and underrepresented minority plastic surgeons had fewer publications, citations, and years of active research. Interestingly, having women in leadership positions was associated with a higher number of women faculty members.</ab>
        <ab>Gender and racial disparity exist in academic plastic surgery in North America. Several changes are required in order for women and underrepresented minorities in medicine to have an equal chance at career advancement. Better representation and diverse leadership have the potential to bring about equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic plastic surgery.</ab>

        <ab>The radiation oncology workforce in the United States is comparatively less diverse than the U.S. population and U.S. medical school graduates. Workforce diversity correlates with higher quality care and outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether student members of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) are any more diverse than resident members-in-training using the recently established medical student membership category.</ab>
        <ab>Self-reported sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, medical school, and degree(s) earned for all medical students (n = 268) and members-in-training (n = 713) were collected from the ASTRO membership database. International members were excluded. The χ 2 test was used to assess for differences between subgroups.</ab>
        <ab>Compared with members-in-training, student members were more likely to be female (40.0% vs 31.5%, P  = .032), black or African American (10.7% vs 4.8%, P  = .009), candidates for or holders of a DO rather than MD degree (5.2% vs 1.5%, P  = .002), and from a U.S. medical school that is not affiliated with a radiation oncology residency program (30.5% vs 20.9%, P  = .001). There was no significant difference in self-reported Hispanic ethnicity (7.3% vs 5.4%, P  = .356). There were no indigenous members in either category assessed.</ab>
        <ab>Medical student members of ASTRO are more diverse in terms of black race, female sex, and osteopathic training, though not in terms of Hispanic ethnicity or nonmultiracial indigenous background, than the members-in-training. Longitudinal engagement with these students and assessment of the factors leading to specialty retention versus attrition may increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in radiation oncology.</ab>

        <ab>Tobacco-related cancer incidence and mortality and commercial tobacco use have decreased steadily in recent decades, but improvements have not been equitably experienced across population subgroups. A complex interaction across socioecological domains of individual, interpersonal, community/organization, and societal/policy factors influence disparities in tobacco use, treatment, and related health outcomes. NCI's Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) provides an ideal platform to examine and intervene on multilevel influences across the cancer control continuum to reduce any disproportionate tobacco-related burden and eliminate tobacco-related disparities. The C3I Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Working Group encourages cancer centers to develop, evaluate, and adopt evidence-based practices regarding DEI for prevention and treatment of commercial tobacco use across the cancer control continuum. This paper highlights how 3 C3I sites intervene to address socioecological influences on tobacco use among racially, ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient subgroups. It then outlines ways in which DEI considerations could be integrated into research with patients with cancer who use tobacco and practices related to standards of cancer care. Incorporating DEI considerations in the pursuit of optimal tobacco treatment could facilitate elimination of inequities in population-level cancer outcomes, spanning the full continuum of cancer care from prevention to survivorship.</ab>

        <ab>Racially and ethnically diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities have historically been disproportionately affected by disasters and public health emergencies in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health established the National Consensus Panel on Emergency Preparedness and Cultural Diversity to provide guidance to agencies and organizations on developing effective strategies to advance emergency preparedness and eliminate disparities among racially and ethnically diverse communities during these crises. Adopting the National Consensus Panel recommendations, the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity; Language Services; and academic-community partnerships used existing health equity resources and expertise to develop an operational framework to support the organization's COVID-19 response and to provide a framework of health equity initiatives for other academic medical centers. This operational framework addressed policies to support health equity patient care and clinical operations, accessible COVID-19 communication, and staff and community support and engagement, which also supported the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care. Johns Hopkins Medicine identified expanded recommendations for addressing institutional policy making and capacity building, including unconscious bias training for resource allocation teams and staff training in accurate race, ethnicity, and language data collection, that should be considered in future updates to the National Consensus Panel's recommendations.</ab>

        <ab>The optimal relational experiences of infants and young children demand a cross-sector workforce informed by Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMH) principles and practices. A recent review by the Alliance for the Advancement of Infant Mental Health, Inc identified seven themes that help define "What makes an IECMH association strong?": (1) Identity, (2) Cross-Systems Collaborations, (3) Sound Organizational Structure, (4) Competency-Informed Training, (5) Reflective Supervision Capacity, (6) Policy, and (7) Higher Education. The present paper documents the story of the Association of Infant Mental Health in Tennessee (AIMHiTN) and the role of the Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice Promoting IECMH in that growth across those seven themes with the additional themes of (8) Funding and, (9) Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. First, foundational literature is reviewed to summarize IECMH-informed workforce development. Next, AIMHiTN's story of workforce development is mapped onto the nine themes and challenges and lessons learned are summarized. The article aims to serve as a roadmap for other states, provinces, territories, or nations hoping to develop their own Association for Infant Mental Health (AIMH) as well as a guide for those with existing AIMHs for promoting continued growth and sustainability.</ab>

        <ab>Nursing PhD and DNP programs lack diversity and cultural responsiveness and, as a result, minority students are underrepresented in these programs. Stressors specific to being a member of a minority population, defined as minority stress, contribute to a range of barriers for ethnic/racial minority, male and LGBTQ PhD and DNP students. There is an urgent need for faculty and administrators to support minority doctoral student success by taking proactive steps to identify and begin to deconstruct these barriers. Doctorally-prepared nursing faculty serve as mentors and role models for doctoral students, provide exemplars for how to use scientific humility to research health inequities, implement evidence-based practice and develop the next generation of nurse scientists. Combating educational inequities for minority doctoral students is a first step in advancing health equity beyond academia.</ab>
        <ab>The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical synthesis to promote minority PhD and DNP student success in academia.</ab>
        <ab>The minority doctoral student success (MDSS) framework was developed using Schneider's attraction-selection-attrition framework, key concepts from the literature, and professional and personal experience to capture the minority doctoral student experience. A systems approach was used to identify multi-level influences on the minority student experience, including antecedents at each stage of the academic journey, and how minority stress and opportunity inherently affect the process.</ab>
        <ab>Diversity is essential to reimagine nursing doctoral education. This theoretical framework provides an approach to understanding the minority PhD and DNP student experience and the role of faculty and the academic organization in mediating barriers and creating opportunities to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>An awakening to systemic anti-Black racism, anti-Indigenous racism, and harmful colonial structures in the context of a pandemic has made health inequities and injustices impossible to ignore, and is driving healthcare organizations to establish and strengthen approaches to inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). Health research and care organizations, which are shaping the future of healthcare, have a responsibility to make IDEA central to their missions. Many organizations are taking concrete action critically important to embedding IDEA principles, but durable change will not be achieved until IDEA becomes a core leadership competency. Drawing from the literature and consultation with individuals recognized for excellence in IDEA-informed leadership, this study will help Canadian healthcare and health research leaders-particularly those without lived experience-understand what it means to embed IDEA within traditional leadership competencies and propose opportunities to achieve durable change by rethinking governance, mentorship, and performance management through an IDEA lens.</ab>

        <ab>The Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) connects pediatric dermatologists, trainees, basic scientists, allied health professionals, and patient advocates to improve the lives of children with skin disease through research. As a training pipeline for future pediatric dermatologists and steward of research in the field, PeDRA has a responsibility to examine its history and take actionable steps to diversify its membership, grant recipients, study leads, research priorities, and leadership.</ab>
        <ab>In 2020, PeDRA formed an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Task Force to address this need. In an effort to assess PeDRA's past and plan for PeDRA's future, a review of PeDRA's membership, leadership, grant awardees, and research topics was conducted.</ab>
        <ab>Results demonstrated gaps in PeDRA's current operational efforts to diversify the pediatric dermatology workforce and identified areas for improvement. Recommendations are proposed as a call to action for the community.</ab>

        <ab>The Infant Mental Health Journal is committed to ending systemic racism and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic publishing. IMHJ unequivocally denounces all forms of racism and white supremacy, including systemic racism in academic publishing. We commit to investigating and working to terminate the ways in which systemic racism has become normalized in academic publishing, including examining our practices and processes at IMHJ. We invite you to join us in intentional, anti-racist work through your scholarship. As part of this effort, IMHJ has updated the author guidelines to include new information regarding how authors can express the ways in which they are engaging with intention in diverse, anti-racist research. These guidelines are available under the author guidelines section on the IMHJ website (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970355). As a second immediate response relative to promoting diverse, equitable, and inclusive research, IMHJ is releasing the following Call to Action, focusing on centering Blackness in infant and early childhood mental health research. This call is designed as a first step in our efforts, and IMHJ looks forward to coming initiatives aimed at disrupting systemic racism in infant and early childhood mental health research for the many scholars studying and working with diverse populations marginalized by racism and systemic inequities.</ab>

        <ab>The use of words such as race, racism, antiracism, and antiracist has increased in health professions education (HPE). While the words are used more frequently, additional work is needed to demonstrate a commitment to enhance equity, diversity, and inclusion in HPE. It is important that we contextualize these words, understand the connections between them, and use this information to implement sustainable actions to disrupt the status quo in HPE. Critical race theory is a tool to consider for this journey. In this commentary, the author provides an overview of key concepts ranging from race to critical race theory as a primer to the Research in Medical Education plenary.</ab>

        <ab>Studies have found race-related stress psychologically and physiologically harms members of stigmatized racial groups. However, the stressor is racism, not race.</ab>
        <ab>This study examined the relationship between racism-related stress and psychological resilience in Black/African American nurses.</ab>
        <ab>This study used a cross-sectional, quantitative, correlational design with two instruments, an investigator-developed demographic questionnaire and a convenience sample.</ab>
        <ab>Participants perceived they have low psychological resilience in stressful situations. With racism-related stress, in particular, participants perceived they are affected by both lived and vicarious racism - ruminating over past occurrences, and expecting/worrying that racism will happen to them or other Black/African American people. There was a significant positive correlation between participants' perceived psychological resilience, their ability to assess the nature of the racism-related stressor and their ability to mitigate its harmful effects by identifying and utilizing their coping resources. There was a negative correlation between racism-related stress and psychological resilience.</ab>
        <ab>There is a need for continued research on racism-related stress among Black/African American nurses. Further, healthcare organizations, advisably through their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, must develop systemic approaches to meeting the unique needs of the Black/African American workforce.</ab>

        <ab>The Association of Southeastern Biologists was founded in 1937 with the goal of increasing the contact and collaboration between scientists in the southeastern United States (US). With the exception of two years during World War II and one year during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Association has met annually to promote research and education in the biological sciences by providing a student-friendly networking environment. In recent years, the Association has placed an increased focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion among elected and appointed leaders, among participants in the annual meeting, and in the development of funding and other opportunities for students. This work prompted us to review the history of our Association, including periods of racial segregation and inequity, and focus on our current efforts to promote access and inclusion by students and scientists from myriad underrepresented groups. In so doing, the past provides us with the opportunity to cast a vision for the future of the Association. In this paper, we seek to share the journey of the Association of Southeastern Biologists in this regard so that we may be transparent, exposing the missteps and amplifying the successes of our organization. We envision this work as a first step toward creating a more open and inclusive scientific community for the future.</ab>

        <ab>The Department of Family and Preventive Medicine is home for the University of Utah's Family Medicine Residency program. Although Utah's diversity is steadily increasing, the race/ethnic diversity of the program's family medicine residency does not reflect the state's general population.</ab>
        <ab>From 2017 to 2021, the residency instituted several adjustments to recruitment processes, including modification of an existing screening system to better highlight resiliency in overcoming challenging life experiences; promotion of commitment to diversity during interview days; incorporation of increased participation from diverse faculty and residents on interview days; and addition of outreach from the Office of Health, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. Underrepresented in medicine (URiM) applicants were the first to be offered interviews in an identical screening score cohort, and were ranked highest in rank lists in cohorts with identical final rank scores.</ab>
        <ab>Over the past five match cycles, Latinx residents have increased from zero to six, and underrepresented Asian residents from zero to two. In the 2021 match cycle, five of 10 incoming residents (50%) are URiM. Overall, URiM residents are now 30%, and residents of color 36%, of a total of 30 residents across all 3 training years. We found that eight URiM interviews were needed for every one URiM match.</ab>
        <ab>Intentional resident recruitment initiatives can transform racial/ethnic diversity in a family medicine residency program in a short amount of time.</ab>

        <ab>The way that diversity, equity, and inclusion impact scientific careers varies for everyone, but it is evident that institutions providing an environment where being different or having differences creates a sense of being welcomed, supported, and valued are beneficial to the scientific community at large. In this commentary, three short stories from Texas-based microbiologists are used to depict (i) the importance of bringing the guiding principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion within their professional roles, (ii) the need to apply and translate those principles to support and enable successful scientific careers among peers and trainees, and (iii) the impact of effective science communication to increase the understanding of microbial environments among the community at large.</ab>

        <ab>While there is movement to create more equitable and holistic admission review processes, faculty continue to place strong emphasis on a single piece of information when making admissions decisions: standardized test scores. This study used an experimental design to test whether instructions provided to faculty prior to assessing doctoral applicants could support holistic review by reducing the weight of the general record examination (GRE) in faculty appraisals of competence and merit for graduate study. Tenured and/or tenure-track faculty ( N =271) were randomly assigned to one of three instructional conditions: Control (no instruction), "Diamond in the Rough," and "Weed Out." In addition, faculty participants were randomly assigned to read one of two vignettes of a prospective first-generation student who either received high or average GRE scores. Faculty then rated the applicant's competence using a three-item survey. As expected, faculty who read the vignette describing the candidate with the high GRE rated him as more competent than faculty who read the average GRE vignette. In addition, being instructed to seek out diamonds in the rough buffered the effect of the GRE score on competence. Faculty were also asked to indicate whether they would need additional information to make an admissions decision. They were more likely to ask about grades and research skills than about psychosocial factors that might contextualize the candidate's performance and perceived competence. The results of this study have implications for creating more equitable doctoral admissions processes that center equity, diversity, and inclusion in decision making.</ab>

        <ab>The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) is expected to provide surgical care to a diverse patient population across Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). To improve the quality-of-care individuals receive, the surgical workforce must reflect the population it serves. Achieving diversity within RACS will strengthen therapeutic relationships with patients and promote an inclusive culture. This study investigates the perspectives of underrepresented minority (URM) trainees to highlight barriers for the selection and completion of the RACS Surgical Education and Training (SET) program.</ab>
        <ab>This qualitative study used online, semi-structured, in-depth interviews of URM trainees. Participants were recruited by self-identification and were invited to participate based on inclusion criterion. Interviews took place between August and October 2020, were transcribed and de-identified. Framework analysis was used to identify themes.</ab>
        <ab>Eight participants from four surgical specialities were interviewed, six from Australia and two from New Zealand. There were six female and two male participants. The findings identified barriers that were grouped into eight broad areas: discouragement; structural racism, discrimination and unconscious bias; language barriers; policies and procedures; lack of role models; homophobia; sexual harassment and women in surgery.</ab>
        <ab>The findings offer guidance to RACS and the surgical community to explore new strategies to improve the experience of URM SET trainees. While on a small scale, the study draws directly on the URMs' experiences to inform strategies addressing equity, diversity and inclusion. The aim is to produce a diverse surgical workforce that better delivers healthcare services to a diverse population.</ab>

        <ab>Family medicine departments see elevating equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)* as socially necessary and as powerful in achieving core missions. The importance and timeliness of this longstanding issue in medicine are magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic with its disproportionate effect on communities of color and by civil unrest focused on racial justice. EDI plays out in three pillars: (1) care delivery and health, (2) workforce recruitment and retention, and (3) learner recruitment and training. People are at very different places with EDI work with regard to knowledge, experience, comfort and confidence. This is a wide-ranging developmental challenge, not a narrow, technical, or quick fix. The Immediate Goal: To make a strong start in taking all faculty and staff on a participatory journey that brings changes in everything they do, using inclusive means to this inclusive end. Initial Achievements: An inclusive process that resulted in (1) a shared intellectual framework-definitions with "north star" goals across the three pillars of EDI action, (2) shared acceptance of need for change, (3) top growth areas with actions to take, and (4) harnessing the energy for action-many volunteers, a visible leader, and charge. Ongoing Action: Application of an equity lens to department relationships, specific incidents, tools and education, policy review, and measures development. Invitation to Further Conversation Among Departments: EDI work can quickly create a shared intellectual framework and broadly engage people in taking a department down its developmental path. Operating principles for undertaking such work are offered for conversation among departments.</ab>

        <ab>Racism is an ongoing public health crisis that undermines health equity for all children in hospitals across our nation. The presence and impact of institutionalized racism contributes to health inequity and is under described in the medical literature. In this review, we focus on key interdependent areas to foster inclusion, diversity, and equity in Children's Hospitals, including 1) promotion of workforce diversity 2) provision of anti-racist, equitable hospital patient care, and 3) prioritization of academic scholarship focused on health equity research, quality improvement, medical education, and advocacy. We discuss the implications for clinical and academic practice. Plain Language Summary : Racism in Children's Hospitals harms children. We as health-care providers and hospital systems are part of the problem. We reviewed the literature for the best ways to foster inclusion, diversity, and equity in hospitals. Hospitals can be leaders in improving child health equity by supporting a more diverse workforce, providing anti-racist patient care, and prioritizing health equity scholarship.</ab>

        <ab>Disability is an important and often overlooked component of diversity. Individuals with disabilities bring a rare perspective to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) because of their unique experiences approaching complex issues related to health and disability, navigating the healthcare system, creatively solving problems unfamiliar to many individuals without disabilities, managing time and resources that are limited by physical or mental constraints, and advocating for themselves and others in the disabled community. Yet, individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in STEMM. Professional organizations can address this underrepresentation by recruiting individuals with disabilities for leadership opportunities, easing financial burdens, providing equal access, fostering peer-mentor groups, and establishing a culture of equity and inclusion spanning all facets of diversity. We are a group of deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) engineers, scientists, and clinicians, most of whom are active in clinical practice and/or auditory research. We have worked within our professional societies to improve access and inclusion for D/HH individuals and others with disabilities. We describe how different models of disability inform our understanding of disability as a form of diversity. We address heterogeneity within disabled communities, including intersectionality between disability and other forms of diversity. We highlight how the Association for Research in Otolaryngology has supported our efforts to reduce ableism and promote access and inclusion for D/HH individuals. We also discuss future directions and challenges. The tools and approaches discussed here can be applied by other professional organizations to include individuals with all forms of diversity in STEMM.</ab>

The leadership role of both editors and editorial boards of these journals, books, and digital media provides an important opportunity to support professional diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plus democratization of knowledge. 1 Multiple events in many countries in recent times have revealed the need to work harder at DEI to ensure a level playing field for all patients, clinicians, and researchers.</ab>

        <ab>Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to increase diversity in U.S. medical schools, persistent applicant and enrollment gaps remain for students from underrepresented racial and economic backgrounds. To understand these gaps, we propose a new theory of 'academic redlining' as a widespread practice in medical schools that systematically excludes students from underrepresented backgrounds from entry into medicine through the nearly universal use of Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) cutoff scores. In this paper, we provide evidence that academic redlining via the MCAT disenfranchises students from underrepresented backgrounds prior to and during the admissions process due to structural racism, and describe the three core mechanisms that cause medical schools to engage in academic redlining: (1) the pursuit of institutional prestige, (2) market competition and pressure, and (3) market bands. Given the persistent lack of diversity in medicine-which contributes to devastating health care disparities-as medical schools redouble their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion, structural alternatives within medical schools' admissions and education practices are offered to curtail the practice of academic redlining in medical school admissions and medicine.</ab>

        <ab>For many women, breast reconstruction is an essential component of the breast cancer care continuum after mastectomy. Despite postmastectomy breast reconstruction now being a standard of care, numerous studies over the past decade have documented persistent racial disparities in breast reconstruction rates, physician referral patterns, and patient knowledge of their reconstructive options. These disparities have disproportionately impacted women of color-most specifically, African American women. Recent data have revealed racial differences in patient comorbidities, informed decision-making satisfaction, and clinical outcomes after breast reconstruction. Explicitly, African American women have significantly more risk factors for complications and less baseline knowledge regarding reconstructive options than white women. With a recent heightened attention focused on social determinants of health, studies designed to improve these racial differences have demonstrated promising results through educational outreach to underserved communities, implementation of tailored legislation promoting inclusion, diversity, and equity, and encouragement of additional recruitment of ethnically underrepresented-in-medicine surgeons. This study uses a targeted review of the literature to provide a summary of racial disparities in breast reconstruction for African American women, with our perspective on opportunities for improvement.</ab>

        <ab>To advance equity, diversity, inclusion and reconciliation, healthcare organizations are increasingly recruiting Indigenous leaders. While it is crucial to involve Indigenous Peoples in solving the problems they experience, serving in these roles presents dilemmas and often harm to the Indigenous incumbents. Non-Indigenous healthcare organizations are encouraged to lay the groundwork for right relations with Indigenous Peoples and sustainable workplaces for Indigenous leadership through understanding and accepting accountability for the problem, getting comfortable with discomfort and being truly prepared for systemic change.</ab>

        <ab>The mission of pediatric medical education is to train the workforce who will provide and innovate child healthcare, including addressing healthcare inequities for children and adolescents of color. A diverse physician workforce is associated with more equitable outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative that our workforce continue to reflect the ever-growing diverse nature of our society. While diversity has been at the forefront of conversations for increasing the number of underrepresented communities in medicine, inclusion and equity are oftentimes overlooked. It is crucial to recognize that while diversity is an important aspect to the UIM experience, the overall impact of diversity is diluted when it is not paired with inclusion and equity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the experiences that shape inclusion and equity for UIM physicians along the training continuum and how negative factors may impact the wellness and career longevity of UIM physicians. Our study explored the experiences of UIM physicians throughout their medical education through the lens of inclusion and equity by exploring three common factors: social support, racism and discrimination, and well-being and burnout. There may be a perception that stressors, including racial discrimination, diminish with progression through one's educational career; however, this review suggests that these stressors manifest differently relative to the trials inherent to each career stage. By exploring the interplay between these factors and the UIM experience as a continuum, we are better able to discuss effective solutions to diversity, equity and inclusion for UIM physicians.</ab>

Such an environment is optimally suited to prepare future dentists well for leading a diverse team of staff members and addressing the oral health care needs of increasingly more diverse patient populations. The objectives were to assess how many United States and Canadian dental schools had participated in a climate study at their parent institution and/or had conducted their own climate study, which topics these studies had addressed, how they collected their data, from whom they collected data, and how the findings affected these academic units.</ab>

        <ab>Forty-six parent institutions (85%) and 27 dental schools (50%) had conducted climate studies. Eighty-seven percent of parent institutions assessed the climate overall and the climate for specific groups (70%), such as for persons from underrepresented minority backgrounds (67%) or different religious backgrounds (59%). Most parent institution and dental school studies utilized surveys to collect data from faculty (parent institutions: 76%/dental schools: 96%), staff (74%/93%), administrators (72%/93%), and students (72%/89%). Overall, climate study results positively affected parent institutions' and dental schools' humanistic environment (61%/63%) and the recruitment of faculty (46%/50%), students (46%/46%), and staff (41%/43%).</ab>
        <ab>Climate studies are a widely accepted practice at dental schools and their parent institutions. Their results can play a vital role in shaping the climate of these academic units by fostering efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>The promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in nursing is a topic of renewed importance, given the civil unrest following the death of George Floyd and identified disparities in health and health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its progress, the nursing profession continues to struggle with recruiting and retaining a workforce that represents the cultural diversity of the patient population. The authors completed a review of the literature on DEI in nursing and found a scarcity of studies, and that a limitation exists due to the strength of the evidence examined. This article aims to provide a review of the literature on DEI in nursing, outcomes and strategies associated with organizational DEI efforts, and knowledge on how the American Nurses Credentialing Center Pathway to Excellence® Designation Program framework supports DEI initiatives. The authors further provided recommendations for nurse leaders and a checklist of proposed questions for assessing commitment, culture, and structural empowerment initiatives toward a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization.</ab>

        <ab>Research in undergraduate STEM education often requires the collection of student demographic data to assess outcomes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Unfortunately, this collection of demographic data continues to be constrained by socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity, leading to problematic panethnic groupings such as "Asian" and "Latinx." Furthermore, these all-encompassing categories of race and ethnicity exasperate the problematic "underrepresented minority" (URM) label when only specific races and ethnicities are categorized as URMs. We have long seen calls for improved outcomes related to URMs in undergraduate STEM education, but seldom have we seen our own understanding of what it means to be a URM go beyond socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity. If we aim to not only improve diversity outcomes but also make undergraduate STEM education more equitable and inclusive, we must reevaluate our use of the term "URM" and its implications for demographic data collection. The classifications of "underrepresented" and "minority" are more nuanced than simple racial categories. Though there has been development of alternative terms to URM, each with their own affordances, the main goal of this article is not to advocate for one term over another but rather to spark a much-needed dialogue on how we can "inclusify" our collection of racial and ethnic demographic data, particularly through data disaggregation and expanding our definition of what it means to be both "underrepresented" and a "minority" within STEM.</ab>

        <ab>Racism in medicine affects patients, trainees, and practitioners and contributes to health care inequities. An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.</ab>

        <ab>Our aim was to conduct a large, case-based diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) simulation exercise with a goal to improve the DEI pillars of cultural and structural awareness for residents.</ab>
        <ab>Utilizing data resulting in poor health outcomes, the top eight themes were utilized, and via a modified Delphi approach, a diverse group of faculty developed representative cases. A mass simulation effort was organized with the assistance of our local simulation office. Twenty residents in groups of two to three rotated through all scenarios. Each resident group was allotted 15 min for each scenario. After each case, resident teams received feedback from standardized patients and a debrief together with the simulation directors. Pre- and postsimulation surveys were developed and distributed to residents.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty residents completed the simulation. Eighteen completed a pre- and postsimulation survey. Every resident rated the overall usefulness of this activity as a 5.0 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest score. All cases demonstrated an improvement in the residents perceived confidence on a 9-point Likert scale. All residents reported improved understanding of key concepts in health care disparities as related to race/ethnicity, homelessness, LGBTQIA, and their own biases. The largest improvement was seen in the overarching theme of "difficult conversations" with a presimulation survey mean of 3.9 and postsimulation survey mean of 6.5 (delta = +2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.9 to 3.3, p  &lt; 0.01).</ab>
        <ab>Emergency medicine residency programs must fulfill their obligation to DEI efforts and national requirements while ensuring competency clinically. Mass simulation exercises are a way to incorporate this training. This preliminary data shows promise for a solution and can be easily duplicated. Diversity, health equity, inclusivity, and cultural humility can be effectively taught by an innovative mass simulation effort.</ab>

        <ab>The gender and racial diversity in the cardiology workforce in Canada does not reflect that of the population we serve. As social awareness of the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion rises, our profession must rise to meet the challenges they present. We detail contemporary examples of publication bias in the cardiac sciences literature and describe the factors that led to oversight in the peer-review process. We performed a narrative review to summarize the published literature on equity and diversity among cardiac physicians. We also summarize the challenges faced by women and racial-minority physicians when pursuing and thriving in a career in cardiology, and the systemic barriers to their success. In the past decade, social justice movements have advanced. Professionalism standards are changing, and awareness and understanding of these advances in terminology is imperative for all physicians. In this review, we summarize key language and concepts, with cardiology-specific examples, and propose a new paradigm of professionalism.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose The aim of this tutorial is to share lessons learned from a speech, language, and hearing sciences department at a land-grant, Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) after revising the graduate admissions review process and subsequent discussions related to equity in assessment. This tutorial describes the department as a case example and includes guiding questions that may be helpful for other organizations. Method An adaptive case study approach was used and centered on supporting students at Hispanic-serving institutions. The approach was characterized by structured collaborative reflection throughout the process and engagement of relevant stakeholders at multiple levels. The adaptive method allowed for interim synthesis of stakeholder discussions to inform subsequent phases of the reflection process. Results This tutorial shares critical motivations, barriers, facilitators, and phases that were identified in moving toward holistic evaluation for graduate admissions. Targeted areas for continued improvement related to diversity, equity, and inclusion are described. Conclusions This tutorial outlines lessons learned from changing graduate admissions practices toward holistic review. Self-reflection prompts are provided for institutions and organizations considering changes to their review process. In order to best support diverse communities, increased workforce diversity is needed in the speech, language, and hearing sciences professions, and holistic review practices are recommended as one way to support increased diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Psychologically safe organizational cultures are inherently inclusive and promote healthy sharing of power and knowledge. These conditions allow innovation to thrive and optimize member performance. Unfortunately, despite its evidence-based nature, the field of medicine continues to struggle with providing safe environments for its members. Several cultural barriers to psychological safety permit endemic harassment. These include having large power gradients, a weak ethical climate, and a number of enabling structural factors that maintain a toxic culture. Moving toward psychological safety will be challenging work, as it requires a difficult and complex analysis of the shared value system that enables the status quo. Programs and policies that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion are an important start, but they are likely insufficient on their own to achieve psychological safety. Leadership that models difficult reflection and supports inclusive transformation is the key to a safe culture shift.</ab>

        <ab>Academic Health Centers (AHCs) across the nation are experiencing a reawakening to the importance of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Such work impacts both employees and patients served by healthcare institutions. Yet, for departments without previously existing formal channels for this work, it is not always apparent where to begin. The current manuscript details a process for creating a committee as a vehicle for championing DEI efforts at the department level within an AHC. The authors present a six-step model for forming a DEI Committee and progress monitoring measures to remain accountable to identified objectives. In each step, the authors provide examples of their work with the goal for readers to tailor and apply each step to their own departments' DEI efforts. The current paper also identifies lessons learned with regard to barriers and facilitators of department-level DEI work. Reflections and next steps for DEI work beyond the proposed model are also discussed.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives have been described in different academic and graduate medical education settings, but not specifically in neurology.</ab>
        <ab>To describe the development of a DEI committee within a neurology department and training program.</ab>
        <ab>The need to prioritize DEI as a critical focus within our neurology department led to the appointment of an initial task force who identified strategic priorities and stakeholders to establish a committee. DEI committee members included faculty, trainees, and staff, and this phase of the initiative took place from May 2019 through January 2021.</ab>
        <ab>The DEI committee was established and has met monthly for over one year. Initial meetings formulated goals of the initiative. Specific objectives were developed in the domains of recruitment, education, engagement, training, conflict resolution, and recognition. Early outcomes included augmented resident recruitment efforts of UiM students, curriculum changes including frequent representation of DEI topics in Grand Rounds, and measures to reduce unconscious bias.</ab>
        <ab>The creation of a DEI Committee within a specialty department such as neurology is feasible and can result in immediate and long-term actions related to recruitment and education in particular. Our blueprint that heavily involves graduate medical education stakeholders may be generalizable to other specialty departments in academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Achieving diversity, inclusion, and gender equity remains an elusive challenge for many institutions worldwide and is understudied in Canadian academic health science centres.</ab>
        <ab>McMaster University's Department of Medicine undertook surveys and analyses to determine whether there was inequity in leadership positions and salaries, or unprofessional behaviour within the department. Measures of academic productivity in relation to gender for both educators and researchers were analyzed. The department began shifting policies to foster greater gender diversity and inclusion. A revision of the leadership selection process, incorporating tenets of equity and a new game theory-based strategy called Diversitive Agreement Versus Nash Equilibrium (DAvNE) was evaluated.</ab>
        <ab>The department's survey revealed underrepresentation of women and people of colour in leadership positions, with perceived barriers to their promotion. Both women and people of colour reported experiencing unprofessional behaviour directed toward them. A gender gap in base salary was observed, with female full professors being paid less. No difference in academic productivity was seen between male and female educators or researchers. The leadership competitions conducted under new selection processes emphasizing diversity resulted in 66% of participating women securing a leadership position, in comparison to 25% of participating men. People of colour made up 27% of members participating in these leadership competitions, but none was successful in obtaining a position.</ab>
        <ab>Diversity and inclusion disparities in the Department of Medicine at McMaster University indicate a need for further efforts and innovation to bring about greater gender and racial equity.</ab>

        <ab>Fusion-transcription factors (fusion-TFs) represent a class of driver oncoproteins that are difficult to therapeutically target. Recently, protein degradation has emerged as a strategy to target these challenging oncoproteins. The mechanisms that regulate fusion-TF stability, however, are generally unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discovered tripartite motif-containing 8 (TRIM8) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades EWS/FLI, a driver fusion-TF in Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, we identified TRIM8 as a selective dependency in Ewing sarcoma compared with &gt;700 other cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, TRIM8 knockout led to an increase in EWS/FLI protein levels that was not tolerated. EWS/FLI acts as a neomorphic substrate for TRIM8, defining the selective nature of the dependency. Our results demonstrate that fusion-TF protein stability is tightly regulated and highlight fusion oncoprotein-specific regulators as selective therapeutic targets. This study provides a tractable strategy to therapeutically exploit oncogene overdose in Ewing sarcoma and potentially other fusion-TF-driven cancers.</ab>

        <ab>Providing high-quality radiation therapy in medically underserved, low-resource environments can be challenging in the United States. During the American Society of Radiation Oncology 2020 Annual Meeting, the American Society for Radiation Oncology Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion hosted 4 radiation oncologists from both academic and community practices in an educational session. Speakers discussed creative ways to overcome barriers to equitable cancer care and outcomes for their vulnerable patient populations in both rural and urban settings. Successful tactics have included applying for state-sponsored grants, lobbying hospital leadership for equipment upgrades, implementing quality improvement programs specifically targeting the needs of the patient population, studying novel hypofractionation schedules, monitoring toxicities using wearable devices, and expanding transportation options.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are increasingly recognized as core values for guiding nursing education, practice, and research. The conceptual framework of cultural humility has been adapted in a variety of health care settings, fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion through openness, supportive interaction, self-awareness, self-reflection, and critique.</ab>
        <ab>Nurse educators have the opportunity, but may find it challenging, to teach students about the changing landscape of health care and the populations we serve.</ab>
        <ab>This article describes the integration of the cultural humility framework into nursing curricula to teach principles of diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We provide a practical example of a diversity panel, with student and panelist reflections, exploring the intersectionality of experiences in health care and integration of personal accounts and perspectives.</ab>
        <ab>Dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion is essential for preparing future nurses to deliver culturally competent care and promote health equity.</ab>

        <ab>Cancer has not been an explicit priority of Canada's international health and development agenda, but it is key to realising the country's Sustainable Development Goal commitments. Multiple converging political, health, and social forces could now drive support for a more integrated Canadian approach to global cancer control. Success will depend on the extent to which Canadian leaders and institutions can build consensus as a community and agree to work together. Collaboration should include agreement on the framing and prioritisation of the core issues, building a broad coalition base, aligning with priorities of international partners, and on a governance structure that reflects the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion. This Series paper will discuss global cancer control within Canada's global health agenda, how Canada can address its history of colonisation and present-day disparities in its global work, and the challenges and opportunities of creating a Canadian global cancer control network.</ab>

        <ab>Vaccines are critical to protect both nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19, but some staff have expressed reservations about being vaccinated. In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare-one of the largest US long-term care providers-implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees' family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs.</ab>

        <ab>Despite improvements in representation of women in academic medicine, the rate of promotion and career advancement remains unequal. Compared with their male colleagues, women report lower rates of personal-organizational value alignment and higher rates of burnout. Particular challenges further exist for Black women, Indigenous women, women of color, and third gender or gender nonbinary faculty. Promoting the well-being of women physicians requires innovative approaches beyond the traditional scope of physician well-being efforts and careful attention to the unique barriers women face. Three wellness-oriented models are presented to promote the professional fulfillment and well-being of women physicians: (1) redefine productivity and create innovative work models, (2) promote equity through workplace redesign and burnout reduction, and (3) promote, measure, and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. By engaging in innovative models for equitable advancement and retention, it is anticipated that diverse groups of women faculty will be better represented at higher levels of leadership and thus contribute to the creation of more equitable work climates, fostering well-being for women physicians.</ab>

        <ab>Environment for the Americas has developed a model internship program that helps to recruit diverse youth for internship positions on federal lands and with non-governmental organizations. To improve the program, we have conducted almost a decade of surveys to examine the barriers diverse youth may face when applying for these positions and working at sites where staff, visitors, and other interns may be predominantly White. Our model has been very successful in addressing barriers, including those presented by Bowser and Cid within this Forum. Survey responses show that issues of connection, confidence, comfort, and capability can be addressed through considerations of culture, staff awareness of diversity, equity, and inclusion, training, communication, and mentorship.</ab>

        <ab>Worksite health and well-being initiatives will ideally be integrated with employers' efforts to address diversity, equity and inclusion issues. Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) include race, class, community health, income and other variables that companies can play a role in ameliorating. As much as spirituality is commonly espoused as a component of a holistic approach to health promotion, making space to discuss faith and health remains an uncommon strategy in the workplace wellness movement. Recognizing the value on investment (VOI) in wellness has eclipsed a return on investment as a driver of an employer's well-being strategy. This editorial argues that making space for learning about faith and health will intersect in vital ways with anti-racism work, diversity programs and similar efforts to eliminate health inequities, address SDOH and bolster the VOI of worksite well-being initiatives. A fictional dialogue between executives is used to review these issues and related literature.</ab>

        <ab>Women have historically been underrepresented as editors of peer-reviewed medical journals. Studies have demonstrated that there are differences in editorial board reviewer behavior based on gender, suggesting that greater representation by women on editorial boards may improve the quality and diversity of the review process. Therefore, the current representation of women on the editorial boards of orthopaedic journals, particularly compared with peer-reviewed surgical and medical journals, is of interest.</ab>
        <ab>(1) What is the representation of women as members of editorial boards of prominent orthopaedic surgery journals? (2) How does it compare with representation on the editorial boards of journals in general surgery and internal medicine?</ab>
        <ab>The top 15 journals with a strong clinical emphasis based on Impact Factor (Clarivate Analytics) calculated by the 2018 Journal Citation Reports were identified for orthopaedic surgery, general surgery (and all general surgical subspecialties), and internal medicine (with representative internal medicine subspecialties). Clinical publications with their primary editorial office located in the United States led predominantly by physicians or basic scientists were eligible for inclusion. The members of an editorial board were identified from the journals' websites. The gender of editors with gender-neutral names (and editors whose gender we considered uncertain) was identified by an internet search for gender-specific pronouns and/or pictures from an institutional profile. Fisher exact tests and t-tests were used to analyze categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.</ab>
        <ab>Of the editors analyzed, women made up 9% (121 of 1383) of editorial boards in the orthopaedic journals with the highest Impact Factors, compared with 21% (342 of 1665) of general surgery journals (p &lt; 0.001) and 35% (204 of 587) of internal medicine journals (p &lt; 0.001). The overall mean composition of editorial boards of orthopaedic journals was 10% ± 8% women, compared with that of general surgery, which was 19% ± 6% women (p &lt; 0.001), and that of internal medicine, which was 40% ± 19% women (p &lt; 0.001).</ab>
        <ab>Women make up a smaller proportion of editorial boards at orthopaedic surgery journals than they do at general surgery and internal medicine journals. However, their representation appears to be comparable to the proportion of women in orthopaedics overall (approximately 6%) and the proportion of women in academic orthopaedics (approximately 19%). Ways to improve the proportion of women on editorial boards might include structured mentorship programs at institutions and personal responsibility for championing mentorship and diversity on an individual level.</ab>
        <ab>Increasing representation of women on editorial boards may improve the diversity of perspectives and quality of future published research, generate visible role models for young women considering orthopaedics as a career, and improve patient care through enriching the diversity of our specialty.</ab>

        <ab>The term evidence based medicine was introduced in the early 1990s in clinical medicine to educate clinicians about how to assess the 'credibility' of research to ensure best treatments for their patients. The evidence based medicine paradigm has become more diffuse in times of austerity and randomised controlled designs are being used to address complex issues in public health and disability research. This research is not addressing inequalities in terms of disability nor how people can live well with disabilities.</ab>
        <ab>We argue that there are four ways that public health research needs to change if it wants to address inequalities linked to disability: 1) rethinking theoretical connections between public health and disability; 2) building ethics and equity into interventions through a human rights approach; 3) ensuring ethical inclusion through intersectionality; and 4) evaluating policy and other social impacts to ensure they capture diversity. We argue that these are key issues to building a social determinants of flourishing.</ab>
        <ab>We need to understand how disability might have an accumulative impact across the life course, as well as how to ensure equity for people living with disabilities. This means conceptualising a social determinants of flourishing where we evaluate how exactly randomised controlled trials and public health interventions, not only lead to greater equality but also ensure rights to health and wellbeing.</ab>

        <ab>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Addressing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism in 21st Century STEMM Organizations convened a national summit in July 2021 that highlighted how racism operates at different levels in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) settings; reviewed policies and practices for confronting systemic racism; and explored ways to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEMM settings. The 2-day, public webcast summit explored the empirical and experiential evidence related to the ways in which systemic racism and other barriers impede STEMM careers for historically marginalized racial/ethnic groups, and explored ways to address these barriers, including strategies undertaken by stakeholder communities. In this summit, speakers discussed how diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism impact STEMM organizations. The workshop presentations focused on issues related to the history of racism in the United States, the lasting legacy of biased policies in the nation, and the research on practices to address systemic and structural racism in STEMM organizations. This publication summarizes the presentation and discussion of summit.</ab>

        <ab>Introduction: School closures prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced opportunities for US youth to be physically active and disproportionately impacted health disparities in this population. Physical education provides the largest intervention to support the physical activity of school-aged youth, but teachers' opinions about how to maintain quality programming during virtual learning periods remain unexplored. Applying a diversity, equity and inclusion framework, this study explored physical education teachers' perceived significance of different design features for an online teaching tool to promote physical activity equity during school closures. Methods: Previous literature and focus groups informed the development of a survey administered in summer/fall 2020. Survey participants ( n = 60) were physical education teachers from 400 randomly selected US preschool-12th grade schools drawing from a national database. Participants rated the significance of four design features in relation to five key attributes of an online supplement to in-person physical education programs. One-way ANOVAs were used to assess differences in teachers' ratings by demographic characteristics. Results: Between-group differences were found in teacher ratings of design features related to the usability, accessibility, equitability, and formal assessment capabilities of an online physical education tool. Differences were based on teacher gender, school level, and geographic location. Conclusions: Future research to promote physical activity equity among preschool-12th grade youth should examine tailored virtual physical education learning tools that address what teachers perceive to be the most significant design features to support equitable physical education among diverse student groups.</ab>

        <ab>Grit refers to the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit has emerged as a recent topic of interest within the medical community. With ever-increasing rates of burnout and psychological distress, increasing attention has been directed towards modulatory or protective factors for these deleterious outcomes. Grit has been studied in regard to a variety of outcomes and variables in medicine. This article reviews the current literature on grit in medicine and summarises the current research on grit and performance metrics, personality characteristics, longitudinal progression, psychological well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, burnout and residency attrition. While there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of grit on performance metrics in medicine, research consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between grit and psychological well-being and a negative correlation between grit and burnout. After discussing some of the inherent limitations of this type of research, this article suggests some possible implications and future areas for research and their potential role in cultivating psychologically healthy physicians and promoting successful careers in medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Racial inequities as illustrated by the health disparities in COVID19 infections and deaths, the recent killings of Black men and women by law enforcement, and the widening socioeconomic inequality and have brought systemic racism into a national conversation. These unprecedented times may have deleterious consequences, increasing stress, and trauma for many members of the neurology workforce. The Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Anti-Racism Committee within our Department of Neurology provides infrastructure and guidance to foster a culture of belonging and addresses the well-being of faculty, staff, and trainees. Here, we present the creation and implementation of our Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism (EDIA) Pledge which was central to our committee's response to these unprecedented times. We outline the process of developing this unique EDIA Pledge and provide a roadmap for approaching these important topics through a CME Neurology Grand Rounds aimed at fostering a diverse, inclusive, equitable and antiracist work environment. Through the lived experiences of 4 faculty members, we identify the impact of bias and microaggressions, and encourage allyship and personal development for cultural intelligence. We hope these efforts will inspire Neurology departments and other academic institutions across the globe to make a similar pledge.</ab>

        <ab>Sparked by recent events, discussions of systemic racism and racial inequalities have been pushed to the foreground of our global society, leading to what is being called the largest modern-day civil rights movement (Buchanan et al., 2020). In the past, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) activists and scholars, among others, have evaluated and critiqued systems and organizations within our society. Nonetheless, it was not until recently that this movement was truly noticed by a greater number of people, some of whom are now further assessing how BIPOC are viewed and treated within their organization and by society as a whole (Worland, 2020). This is not only due to the increase in video evidence (e.g., released body cam footage, social media postings), but also the previous administration's rhetoric and political agenda (Hubler &amp; Bosman, 2021). Police departments, educational institutions, and large companies have, for decades, been under scrutiny for their systems and practices that promote racism, inequality, and inequity. The field of behavior analysis, with its Eurocentric roots and observed lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion, is not exempt from such evaluations. It is time that we take a look in the mirror and evaluate our own professional, research, educational, and clinical practices, and work towards creating a new, more inclusive, field of behavior analysis that promotes anti-racism and cultural humility.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are fundamentally important concepts for advancing clinical and translational science (CTS) education. CTS education spans a wide range of disciplines from cell biology to clinical and community/population research. This large scope both in terms of intellectual areas and target groups requires an understanding of existing educational approaches for DEI as we translate DEI from mere concepts into equitable actions within CTS education. In this  review, we provide the readers with the most common DEI educational approaches, including cultural humility, bias training, and improving mentoring to diversify the workforce. DEI educational materials can achieve maximal success and long-term impact when implemented as institutional-wide interventions, and the materials are not seen as an isolated or independent curriculum. Approaches, strategies, and programs to achieve this are many. However, many questions remain unanswered about what the best approach, strategies, and programs are to be implemented in institutional-wide education that will be embedded in CTS education.</ab>

Over the past 3 decades, they have grown from small groups to large sections within volunteer science organizations. In addition to providing a sense of community and promulgating the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, the WIC sections have contributed to improving workplace culture and dynamics by generating evidence-based and actionable data, fostering leadership by and scientific enrichment of women, developing task forces and health policy documents targeted toward reduction of burnout and bias in medicine, and providing a platform to voice the unique challenges and opportunities of female cardiologists. The future holds great promise, as the WIC sections continue to play a pivotal role by being intentional, transparent, iterative, and sustainable, and working with important stakeholders, including men, to share data, best practices, and strategies to create and maintain a culture of equity and achieve its core principles.</ab>

        <ab>            Background:          The Council of Faculty and Academic Societies (CFAS) comprises representatives from medical schools and professional societies who guide the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Given the AAMC's stated mission to improve diversity and inclusion, we used gender-related representation on journal editorial boards as a proxy for evaluating CFAS member societies' commitments to equity.             Methods:          From screenshots of journal mastheads ( n  = 44) collected June 3-6, 2019, individuals were categorized by editorial position. Outcome measures included numbers of men and women among faculty, deans, department chairs, physicians, and nonphysicians on editorial boards. Outcomes were compared with 2018 AAMC and US Bureau of Labor Statistics workforce data.             Results:          Overall, the proportion of women among journal editors was 29.0% (364 of 1,255), range 0%-53.3%. This proportion was significantly less than the proportion of women among US medical school faculty and medical scientists. The lowest percentages of women were found among journals' section or topic editors (19.2%) and editors-in-chief (20.4%). Men were significantly more likely to be a professor or department chair and women were significantly more likely to be an associate professor or assistant professor, suggesting a bidirectional process between rank and editorial position that may inhibit the advancement of academic women, particularly women physicians.             Conclusions:          This study revealed disparities in the equitable representation of women among CFAS member-affiliated journal editors. Because CFAS member societies participate in a mutually beneficial relationship with the AAMC, they should strive to attain the equity goals set forth by the AAMC.</ab>

        <ab>Vascular surgeons of all backgrounds play an important role in providing high quality vascular surgical care in their communities. In America, with our diverse population and communities, patients presenting with vascular disease are very common and could pattern the community demographic. Often faced with the challenges of community hospital politics and demand, the vascular surgical workforce has continued to be active members in their communities, focusing on their strengths to lead vascular surgery healthcare in an environment of high patient demand. Having a varied vascular surgery workforce provides all patients afflicted by vascular disease a comfortable opportunity for compassionate and empathic vascular care. This is a significant strength of vascular care when diversity, equity, and inclusion are supported by the leadership.</ab>

        <ab>The presented glossary highlights the concepts and terminology related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Although this list should not be considered all-inclusive, it will provide our vascular surgical community with a common vocabulary to help propel change toward improved diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, practices, and culture. As these concepts and terminology find their place in our everyday lives, the Society for Vascular Surgery and its leadership believe that expanding the diversity, equity, and inclusion of vascular surgical professionals is a mission-critical step. This mission will help us improve patient experience through successfully delivering culturally sensitive care for our diverse community. Now is the time.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare disparities are a serious problem that shorten the lives of many Americans, even after accounting for social, cultural, and economic factors and correcting for confounders such as the lack of medical insurance and access to healthcare, black Americans and other minority groups receive worse medical care and experience worse outcomes as a result. Healthcare does not occur in a vacuum; surgeons cannot serve our patients' needs isolated in a bubble and cocooned from larger societal concerns. Although disparities rooted in race likely have the greatest negative effects on our patients' health, plenty of groups exist that have not historically received equal opportunities and acceptance within the surgical world. Despite now accounting for more than one half of all medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions, and the gender pay gap has remained significant in all branches of medicine. It will require active, multifaceted, and sustained effort to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery. We have described the steps that can be taken within surgical departments and in national surgical societies to recruit, retain, and foster a diverse surgical workforce and to develop a more inclusive culture within surgery and surgical training.</ab>

        <ab>The demographics of the United States are rapidly changing, and our health care workforce is not keeping pace with the population trends. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (formerly The American Fertility Society) recognizes the need to increase diversity and is committed to promoting diversity across our membership and leadership as well as promoting equitable quality reproductive care to all patients. In the fall of 2020, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine convened a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force to evaluate and make recommendations on the basis of findings to increase diversity to achieve equity and inclusion of reproductive and infertility services for all women. This article focuses on specific barriers that Black or African American patients face in accessing quality care and that provider's face in training and inclusion in reproductive medicine. Multiple publications have confirmed an improvement in health outcome when there is congruence between the patient and the provider. There is a stark contrast between the racial and ethnic diversity of our providers and other support personnel compared with that of our patients. Despite our best intent to minimize the effects of implicit and explicit bias, mistrust and misunderstandings when there is discordance between patients and providers negatively impacts care. To increase provider diversity, it is crucial that we prioritize pipeline programs that recruit and support underrepresented minority in medicine physicians. Specific recommendations are made to increase diversity in the pipeline to improve patient access to culturally competent quality reproductive medicine care with optimal outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hindered medical student career planning and clinical rotations. Recruitment and networking may be more influential in match outcomes than previous cycles. Medical residency training programs have significant challenges in recruiting diverse applicants. The American Psychiatric Association's Black Caucus developed a virtual recruitment event for residency programs with robust diversity initiatives and underrepresented medical students. This article evaluates our methods, short-term results, and influence on participating medical students.</ab>
        <ab>The authors sent web-based invitations to all programs subscribed to the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training listserv. Programs that demonstrated intention and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion were selected. The authors used various social media platforms and the Black Caucus listserv to advertise to medical students. Student participants received an online feedback survey consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions.</ab>
        <ab>Thirty-six programs and one hundred seven medical students participated in the 2-day diversity fair. Seventy-six students completed the following survey, which is a response rate of 71%. A majority of students reported that this event strongly influenced their interest in a program (71.05) and are actively considering a residency program they had not previously considered (69.74). A majority of medical students (89.47) strongly agreed that program representatives treated them with professionalism and respect.</ab>
        <ab>This event improved communication between highly valued underrepresented minority students applicants and residency programs. A notable majority of participants found the program overwhelmingly beneficial.</ab>

        <ab>Recognizing the need to raise awareness of core diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues in the healthcare system, our previously developed Cultural Complications Curriculum aims to support institutions in reducing cultural error. As we continue program deployment, we discuss the opportunity to apply the Cultural Complications Curriculum to multidisciplinary audiences, such as in cancer programs.</ab>
        <ab>We discuss applicability of the Cultural Complications Curriculum to cancer programs and practices, including how to tailor case discussions to oncology audiences. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of the multidisciplinary care environment and anticipating potential barriers to curriculum implementation, we demonstrate how the Cultural Complications Curriculum may support culture improvement across broad audiences.</ab>
        <ab>The successful application of the Cultural Complication Curriculum to multidisciplinary care programs will depend on appreciating differences in background knowledge, tailoring discussions to audience needs, and adapting material by incorporating new data and addressing emerging DEI issues. Multidisciplinary environments may require innovative approaches to education including virtual platforms, increased collaboration across centers and systems, and support from professional societies. In integrated care environments, like oncology, effective DEI discussions call for the engagement of a variety of medical specialties and departments.</ab>
        <ab>To meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population and workforce, our approach to DEI education must embrace the interdependent nature of care delivery. In oncology and other multidisciplinary care environments, application of the Cultural Complications Curriculum may be the first step to combating cultural error by engaging a broader demographic within our healthcare system.</ab>

        <ab>Healthcare is most effectively delivered by high-performance teams, which require, not simply talent, but also diversity in their members, supported by a culture of equity that is open, supportive, and inclusive. Cognitive diversity offers a performance advantage, improving collective understanding and optimizing high-complexity problem solving. Diverse teams have been shown to outperform homogenous team, and this diversity, supplemented with equity and inclusion, yields a superior creative culture. High-performance teams rest on a foundation of standardized and inclusive recruitment practices. Standard recruitment procedures have been insufficient in broadening representation owing to the long-standing inequities and exclusion in medicine. As such, we have highlighted the opportunities for inclusive recruitment practices.</ab>

        <ab>Many of the systemic practices in medicine that have alienated lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals persist today, undermining the optimal care for these patients and isolating LGBTQ medical providers from their colleagues. The 2020 Task Force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report recently published by the Society for Vascular Surgery marked the first publication advocating for the inclusion of sexual orientation and sexual identity in the development of initiatives promoting and protecting diversity across vascular surgery. Vascular providers should be aware that it is crucial to cultivate an environment that is inclusive for LGBTQ patients because a large proportion of these patients have reported not self-disclosing their status to medical providers, either out of concern over potential personal repercussions or failing to recognize the potential relevance of LGBTQ status to their medical care. Safe Zone training has provided a standard resource for providers and staff that can be integrated into onboarding and routine training. Clarifying the current terminology for sexual orientation and identity will ensure that vascular providers will recognize patients who could benefit from screening for additional vascular risk factors relevant to this population related to sexual health, social behavior, physical health, and medical therapies. The adoption of gender neutral language on intake forms and general correspondence with colleagues is key to reducing the unintended exclusion of those with LGBTQ identities in both inpatient and outpatient environments. In many locales across the United States, the professional and personal repercussions for openly reporting LGBTQ status persist, complicating efforts toward quantifying, recognizing, and supporting these patients, practitioners, and trainees. Contributing to an inclusive environment for patients and peers and acting as a professional ally are congruent with the ethos in vascular surgery to treat all patients and colleagues with respect and optimize the healthcare of every vascular patient.</ab>

        <ab>WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: There is evidence that the LGBT communities experience greater health disparities, particularly in relation to their mental health needs. The LGBT communities are often faced with stigma and discrimination within mental health services. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: People within the LGBT communities have identified that their experiences of mental health services reinforce stigma and lack an understanding of their specific needs. Their needs can be addressed by mental health services that challenge heteronormative assumptions and promote self-acceptance and equity. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The existing heteronormative culture in mental health nursing practice needs to be challenged. Practice needs to demonstrate self-awareness of personal and societal LGBT biases, prejudices, and stigma. Practice needs to demonstrate knowledge of important LGBT health care and psychosocial issues. Practice needs to reflect LGBT clinical skills grounded in professional ethics, guidelines, and standards of care.</ab>
        <ab>INTRODUCTION: The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities are a minority population that experience a range of health disparities, including mental health. Because these groups have higher rates of mental disorder than the general population it is, therefore, pertinent to identify their specific mental health needs and their experiences when accessing mental health care.</ab>
        <ab>To identify the mental health needs of the LGBT communities and their experiences of accessing mental health care.</ab>
        <ab>An integrative review of qualitative studies was conducted.</ab>
        <ab>A total of fourteen studies were selected for this review. The studies identified that participants' experiences of accessing mental health care were related to (a) experiencing stigma and (b) staff's lack of knowledge and understanding of LGBT people's needs. They identified a need for mental health care that promotes the principles of equity, inclusion and respect for diversity.</ab>
        <ab>The LGBT communities while not a homogenous group, face unique challenges when dealing with their mental health needs. Services that promote health equity and self-acceptance are important for this group.</ab>
        <ab>It is vital that mental health nursing education incorporate models that promote equity, inclusion and respect for diversity regarding this group of people.</ab>

        <ab>Publication bias has been shown to exist in research across medical and surgical specialties. Bias can occur at any stage of the publication process and can be related to race, ethnicity, age, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. Although some improvements have been made toward addressing this issue, bias still spans the publication process from authors and peer reviewers, to editorial board members and editors, with poor inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities throughout. The result of bias remaining unchecked is the publication of research that leaves out certain groups, is not applicable to all people, and can result in harm to some populations. We have highlighted the current landscape of publication bias and strived to demonstrate the importance of addressing it. We have also provided solutions for reducing bias at multiple stages throughout the publication process. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all aspects of the publication process, requiring diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in reports, and providing specific education and guidelines will ensure the identification and eradication of publication bias. By following these measures, we hope that publication bias will be eliminated, which will reduce further harm to certain populations and promote better, more effective research pertinent to all people.</ab>

        <ab>Aim: While diversity, equity, and inclusion are much proclaimed aspirational goals in education programs, the clinical learning environment (CLE) frequently falls short of meaningful incorporation of these concepts in processes, policies, and local culture. In this paper, we explore how inclusion, diversity, and equity can and should be defined and operationalized within medical education. Methods: Three cases, organized around Hafferty's curricular framework (formal, informal, and hidden), we illustrate lapses and potential best practices in inclusion in the CLE. Results: The essential "best-practice" of programs inclusive of diverse individuals is the design of policies, processes, and behavioral norms co-creatively with all community members. Potential pitfalls to greater inclusion include nostalgic reference to "the past", a neutrality that is operationalized without the rudder of explicit values and not recognizing that ethical obligations between teachers, learners, and programs are at the heart of the discussion of how inclusive learning and work environments are built. Conclusion: Inclusive CLE's provide space for co-creation, understand the need to ensure the voices of the vulnerable (i.e. learners) are heard and valued and through this promote the flourishing of diverse human capital, in keeping with a model that views diversity as a key attribute or organizational excellence.</ab>

        <ab>Authors in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education (JMBE) have demonstrated a clear commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) through commentaries, instructional approaches, and research. However, analysis of JMBE literature using Kendi's antiracist framework ( How To Be an Antiracist , 2019) offers additional opportunities for growth. These opportunities are discussed and framed under five emergent conceptual categories (ECCs). First, capitalistic goals (e.g., productivity) are often drivers for DEI initiatives but disproportionately benefit those with power. Humanity-centered reasons, like honoring community values, are also important motivations. Second, faculty are often targeted as primary agents of change for DEI, but more powerful stakeholders such as department and institutional leadership can also implement equitable policies and practices to widen the impact of DEI initiatives. Third, study scopes are sometimes focused on the outcomes of inequity (e.g., lower retention rates for students of color) rather than the systemic causes (e.g., exclusivity of science). While outcomes are important to research, studies should create clear connections and distinctions between the systems and symptoms of inequity. Fourth, active learning and authentic research experiences are not automatically inclusive and do not necessarily validate students' identities. Such approaches may be more impactful when tailored for context and student background. Finally, language and communication can have broad impacts on DEI efforts. As a community, we may need to be more critical of our shared language and communication. This review discusses the five ECCs in depth and offers next steps for supporting DEI across the biology and microbiology education community.</ab>

        <ab>New conference formats are emerging in response to COVID-19 and climate change. Virtual conferences are sustainable and inclusive regardless of participant mobility (financial means, caring commitments, disability), but lack face-to-face contact. Hybrid conferences (physical meetings with additional virtual presentations) tend to discriminate against non-fliers and encourage unsustainable flying. Multi-hub conferences mix real and virtual interactions during talks and social breaks and are distributed across nominally equal hubs. We propose a global multi-hub solution in which all hubs interact daily in real time with all other hubs in parallel sessions by internet videoconferencing. Conference sessions are confined to three equally-spaced 4-h UTC timeslots. Local programs comprise morning and afternoon/evening sessions (recordings from night sessions can be watched later). Three reference hubs are located exactly 8 h apart; additional hubs are within 2 h and their programs are aligned with the closest reference hub. The conference experience at each hub depends on the number of local participants and the time difference to the nearest reference. Participants are motivated to travel to the nearest hub. Mobility-based discrimination is minimized. Lower costs facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion. Academic quality, creativity, enjoyment, and low-carbon sustainability are simultaneously promoted.</ab>

        <ab>On behalf of the Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology, we are pleased to present the Abstracts from the 2021 Annual Conference, titled "Advocating for All: Psychosocial Oncology at the Intersections of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion". The Conference was held virtually from 8 June 2021 to 10 June 2021. This conference brought together key stakeholders including multidisciplinary professionals from nursing, psychology, psychiatry, social work, spiritual care, nutrition, medicine, rehabilitation medicine, occupational health and radiation therapy for both adult and pediatric populations. Participants included clinicians, researchers, educators in cancer care, community-based organizations and patient representatives. Patients, caregivers and family members presented abstracts that speak to their role in managing cancer experiences and care. Over one hundred (100) abstracts were selected for presentation as symposia, 20-min oral presentations, 10-min oral presentations, 90-min workshops and poster presentations. We congratulate all the presenters on their research work and contribution.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the global sanitation sector have not been the subject of extensive investigation or scrutiny. However, without diverse leadership, the sector will continue to experience failure, inefficient use of dwindling resources, and overall low sanitation coverage rates, with 2 billion people lacking sanitation access. This research presents the first quantitative study of sanitation leadership demographics. The results revealed that older, white males from High-Income Countries comprised over a third of all leadership positions. This research found that two-thirds of all sanitation leaders were white, with white leaders 8.7 times more likely to hold multiple positions across different organizations than Black, Indigenous, or other People of Color. Eighty-eight out of one hundred organizations were headquartered in a High-Income Country, and western institutions dominated education data. Black, Indigenous, and other Women of Color were the least represented group, highlighting the importance of an intersectional perspective when discussing gender and racial equality. These issues must be urgently addressed if the Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 targets are to be met effectively. Institutional reform, inclusive hiring policies, and transforming individual attitudes are starting points for change. More organizational data should be made available, and further research needs to be conducted on these topics if a change is to be seen in time for 2030.</ab>

        <ab>The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact leading to novel adaptations in post-graduate medical education for cardiovascular and general internal medicine. Whilst the results of initial community COVID-19 vaccination are awaited, continuation of multimodality teaching and training that incorporates telelearning will have enduring benefit to post-graduate education and will place educational establishments in good stead to nimbly respond in future pandemic-related public health emergencies. With the rise in innovative virtual learning solutions, medical educators will have to leverage technology to develop electronic educational materials and virtual courses that facilitate adult learning. Technology-enabled virtual learning is thus a timely progression of hybrid classroom initiatives that are already adopted to varying degrees, with a need for faculty to serve as subject matter experts, to host and moderate online discussions, and to provide feedback and overall mentorship. As an extension from existing efforts, simulation-based teaching (SBT) and learning and the use of mixed reality technology should also form a greater core in the cardiovascular medicine curriculum. We highlight five foundational themes for building a successful e-learning model in cardiovascular and general post-graduate medical training: (1) digital solutions and associated infrastructure; (2) equity in access; (3) participant engagement; (4) diversity and inclusion; and (5) patient confidentiality and governance framework. With digitalisation impacting our everyday lives and now how we teach and train in medicine, these five guiding principles provide a cognitive scaffold for careful consideration of the required ecosystem in which cardiovascular and general post-graduate medical education can effectively operate. With due consideration of various e-learning options and associated infrastructure needs; and adoption of strategies for participant engagement under sound and just governance, virtual training in medicine can be effective, inclusive and equitable through the COVID-19 era and beyond.</ab>

        <ab>AbstractEcologists and evolutionary biologists are fascinated by life's variation but also seek to understand phenomena and mechanisms that apply broadly across taxa. Model systems can help us extract generalities from amid all the wondrous diversity, but only if we choose and develop them carefully, use them wisely, and have a range of model systems from which to choose. In this introduction to the Special Feature on Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB), we begin by grappling with the question, What is a model system? We then explore where our model systems come from, in terms of the skills and other attributes required to develop them and the historical biases that influence traditional model systems in EEB. We emphasize the importance of communities of scientists in the success of model systems-narrow scientific communities can restrict the model organisms themselves. We also consider how our discipline was built around one type of "model scientist"-a history still reflected in the field. This lack of diversity in EEB is unjust and also narrows the field's perspective, including by restricting the questions asked and talents used to answer them. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion will require acting at many levels, including structural changes. Diversity in EEB, in both model systems and the scientists who use them, strengthens our discipline.</ab>

        <ab>Despite institutional claims of the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, people with disabilities remain under-represented. Current policies neglect to explicitly address inclusion of the growing population of students with disabilities who rely on service dogs, specifically in accessing teaching and research laboratories. With the increase in students registering for post-secondary disability services, the science community has outgrown general policies that primarily outline steps for exclusion of student service dog handlers. Here we discuss barriers and areas in need of improvement and then outline explicit guidelines for inclusion that are currently absent from existing policies. Particular concerns arise in teaching and research laboratories where live animals are present, and we recommend further research is needed to make informed decisions. In order to realize our vision of a diverse STEM workforce, academic institutions and professionals need to recognize barriers to inclusion and consider their role in making science accessible.</ab>

        <ab>Coronavirus disease 2019 and the publicly documented deaths of countless Black individuals have highlighted the need to confront systemic racism, address racial/ethnic disparities, and improve diversity and inclusion in radiology. Several radiology departments have begun to create diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committees to systematically address DEI issues in radiology. However, there are few articles that provide departments with guidance on how to create DEI committees to comprehensively address DEI issues in radiology. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a framework and practical tips for creating a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee.</ab>
        <ab>The authors describe key components of the strategic planning process and lessons learned in the creation of a radiology DEI committee, on the basis of the experience of an integrated, academic northeastern radiology department.</ab>
        <ab>A hospital-based strategic planning process defining the DEI vision, mission, goals, and strategies was used to inform the formation of the radiology department DEI committee. The radiology department performed gap analyses by conducting internal and external research. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analyses were performed on the basis of consultations with institutional and other departmental DEI leaders as well as DEI leaders from other academic medical centers. This framework served as the basis for the creation of the radiology departmental DEI committee, including a steering committee and four task forces (education, research, patient experience, and workforce development), each charged with addressing specific institutional goals and strategies.</ab>
        <ab>This review provides academic radiology departments with a blueprint to create a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of the study was to propose a framework, social determinants of learning™ (SDOL™), an actionable model to address learning disparities and expand learning opportunities to support nursing student diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>There is significant growth in the racial and ethnic diversity across students at all levels of higher education, mirroring the growing diversity of the US population. Yet, lower rates of persistence and higher attrition rates among these student groups continue.</ab>
        <ab>The authors established six socially imposed forces, causative domains, as foundational to the SDOL framework. Key attributes of each domain were identified through a literature search. A case study illustrates an initial study of interventions targeting specific domains of the framework aimed toward student success.</ab>
        <ab>Equitable education for all has far-reaching implications across nursing education and higher education in general. Further development and testing of the SDOL framework will support the goal of equitable education for all.</ab>
        <ab>The authors have declared no conflict of interest.</ab>

        <ab>Attention to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is on the rise in Canada, the United States, and the world. While there are evolving efforts across various sectors, post-secondary institutions, in particular, are growing in EDI efforts. For health professional programs, including pharmacy, health disparities are addressed and improvements in health care are realized when faculty are committed to EDI in hiring, admissions, and teaching and learning. To inform the direction and highlight the importance of further EDI research, programming, and evaluation, this paper analyzes the existing literature in pharmacy education and the education of diverse groups.</ab>
        <ab>Several databases were searched, resulting in 17 articles of varying scopes (e.g., reviews, commentaries, reports) that capture principles of pharmacy education for diverse or marginalized students. While other articles were screened for inclusion, the concepts of culture, equity, diversity, and inclusion were presented as part of classroom and curricular topics (e.g., learning about the topics) and did not contain mention or evaluation of the education of diverse or marginalized students in pharmacy.</ab>
        <ab>Pharmacy education literature for diverse and/or marginalized student groups is limited. While significant publications exist regarding pharmacy education about EDI, little attention has been given to how pharmacy programs and educators may adapt their teaching and learning practices, policies, procedures, and admission processes to move beyond the status quo.</ab>
        <ab>Findings from this review will better inform pharmacy education programs to engage in the research and practice of conscious continuous improvement of safe spaces for diverse pharmacy students.</ab>

        <ab>On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. We sought to understand impact of COVID-19 on learner wellness at a large tertiary care academic institution to inform the future development of learner wellness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.</ab>
        <ab>A cross-sectional, internet-based survey collected quantitative and qualitative data from learners April-June 2020. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were reported for quantitative data. Open-ended, qualitative responses were analyzed deductively using thematic analysis.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty percent of enrolled learners in that faculty of medicine (540/2741) participated including undergraduate [Bachelor's] students (25.7%), graduate [science] students (27.5%), undergraduate medical students (22.8%), and postgraduate resident physicians (23.5%). We found that learner wellness across all stages of training was negatively impacted and the ways in which learners were impacted varied as a result of their program's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</ab>
        <ab>Learners in health sciences and medical education report worsening well-being because of the programs and the systems in which they function with the added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future interventions would benefit from a holistic framework of learner wellness while engaging in systems thinking to understand how individuals, programs and respective systems intersect. The importance of acknowledging equity, diversity and inclusion, fostering psychological safety and engaging learners as active participants in their journey during a pandemic and beyond are key elements in developing wellness interventions.</ab>

        <ab>Since early 2020, the world has witnessed the unprecedented accomplishments of the scientific community in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the meantime, we also learned valuable lessons and recognized the challenges that hindered our successes. In this article, we synthesize the ideas discussed at the ASM Virtual Symposium: Microbial Science Research in the Post-COVID Environment on 10 November 2020. We propose three new approaches that microbiology researchers can embrace to overcome these challenges. Moreover, we suggest broad systematic changes to focus on social impacts, teamwork, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe these values are needed to prepare the microbial science research community for future opportunities and challenges.</ab>

        <ab>Implicit bias is one of the most insidious and least recognizable mechanisms that can cause inequity and disparities. There is increasing evidence that both implicit and explicit biases have a negative effect on patient outcomes and patient-physician relationships. Given the impact of Implicit bias, a joint session between ASTROs Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the National Cancer Institute (the ASTRO-National Cancer Institute Diversity Symposium) was held during the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2020 Annual Meeting, to address the effect of implicit bias in radiation oncology through real life and synthesized hypothetical scenario discussions. Given the value of this session to the radiation oncology community, the scenarios and discussion are summarized in this manuscript. Our goal is to heighten awareness of the multiple settings in which implicit bias can occur as well as discuss resources to address bias.</ab>

        <ab>Declaring racism a public health crisis has the potential to shepherd meaningful anti-racism policy forward and bridge long standing divisions between policy-makers, community organizers, healers, and public health practitioners. At their best, the declarations are a first step to address long standing inaction in the face of need. At their worst, the declarations poison or sedate grassroots momentum toward anti-racism structural change by delivering politicians unearned publicity and slowing progress on health equity. Declaring racism as a public health crisis is a tool that must be used with clarity and caution in order to maximize impact. Key to holding public institutions accountable for creating declarations is the direct involvement of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) led groups and organizers. Sharing power, centering their voices and working in tandem, these collaborations ensure that declarations push for change from the lens of those most impacted and authentically engage with the demands of communities and their legacies. Superficial diversity and inclusion efforts that bring BIPOC people and organizers into the conversation and then fail to implement their ideas repeat historical patterns of harm, stall momentum for structural change at best, and poison the strategy at worst. In this paper we will examine three declarations in the United States and analyze them utilizing evaluative criteria aligned with health equity and anti-racism practices. Finally, we offer recommendations to inform anti-racist public health work for meaningful systematic change toward decentralization and empowerment of communities in their health futures.</ab>

        <ab>Higher academic institutions in the UK need to drive improvements in equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) through sustainable practical interventions. A broad view of inclusivity is based on an intersectional approach that considers race, geographical location, caring responsibilities, disability, neurodiversity, religion, and LGBTQIA+ identities. We describe the establishment of a diverse stakeholder group to develop practical grass-roots recommendations through which improvements can be advanced. We have developed a manifesto for change, comprising six domains through which academic institutions can drive progress through setting short, medium, and long-term priorities. Interventions will yield rewards in recruitment and retention of a diverse talent pool, leading to enhanced impact and output.</ab>

        <ab>This article aims to support interpersonal violence (IPV) researchers in promoting diversity and inclusion in their research and scholarship and urges the IPV field to advance a racial equity, anti-oppressive, and justice-driven research agenda. The article discusses a range of factors to consider at each stage of the research process as researchers seek to be inclusive, responsive to diversity concerns, and seek equity. The researcher's perspective and positionality are discussed and the importance of critical self-examination of one's position in relation to the research is emphasized. Participatory and collaborative research processes are recommended, to engage with community partners, strengthen the validity of the findings, and help ensure that the research benefits the participants. Examples illustrate ways researchers might support diversity and inclusion with respect to sampling and measurement, cultural validity, and the conceptualization and operationalization of race. Recommendations are offered to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion when analyzing data, interpreting results, and writing up the study. The importance of a strengths-based approach and structural level analysis is emphasized. This article goes beyond discussion of the minimum, "do no harm" standard that researchers should meet in attending to diversity and inclusion in research and urges the pursuit of equity, anti-racism, and justice toward dismantling those structures that perpetuate violence in its many forms. Researchers are encouraged to ask themselves: Where would I situate my research? Is it racist, not racist, or anti-racist? Not all IPV research has the goal of dismantling inequities, but we should aspire that it do so.</ab>

        <ab>The COVID-19 pandemic and the upheaval it is causing may be leading to novel manifestations of the well-established mechanisms by which women have been marginalized in professional roles, robbing the field of the increased collective intelligence that exists when diverse perspectives are embraced. Unconscious bias, gendered expectations, and overt hostility minimize the contributions of women in academic medicine to the detriment of all. The current environment of heightened stress and new socially distant forms of communication may be exacerbating these well-recognized obstacles to women contributing to the field. Of note, none of these actions requires ill intent; all they require is the activation of unconscious biases and almost instinctive preferences and behaviors that favor the comfortable and familiar leadership of men in a time of extreme stress. The authors argue that it is time to investigate the frequency of behaviors that limit both the recognition and the very exercise of women's leadership during this pandemic, which is unprecedented but nevertheless may recur in the future. Leaders in health care must pay attention to equity, diversity, and inclusion given increases in undermining and harassing behaviors toward women during this crisis. The longer-term consequences of marginalizing women may hamper efforts to combat the next pandemic, so the time to flatten the rising gender bias curve in academic medicine is now.</ab>

        <ab>As protests against racism occur all over the United States and medical institutions face calls to incorporate antiracism and health equity curricula into professional training and patient care, the antiracism discourse has largely occurred through a Black/African American and White lens. Hispanics, an umbrella category created by the U.S. government to include all people of Spanish-speaking descent, are the largest minority group in the country. Hispanics are considered an ethnic rather than a racial group, although some Hispanics self-identify their race in terms of their ethnicity and/or country of origin while other Hispanics self-identify with any of the 5 racial categories used by the U.S. government (White, Black/African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). Expanding the antiracism discourse in medicine to include Hispanic perspectives and the diversity of histories and health outcomes among Hispanic groups is crucial to addressing inequities and disparities in health and medical training. A lack of inclusion of Hispanics has contributed to a growing shortage of Hispanic physicians and medical school faculty in the United States as well as discrimination against Hispanic physicians, trainees, and patients. To reverse this negative trend and advance a health care equity and antiracist agenda, the authors offer steps that medical schools, academic medical centers, and medical accreditation and licensing bodies must take to increase the representation of Hispanics and foster their engagement in this evolving antiracism discourse.</ab>

        <ab>Inequities in neonatal care quality and outcomes persist. Current models of neonatal quality improvement (QI) typically involve implementation of standardized approaches to clinical care that seek to provide consistent care to all infants and their families, which may neglect to account for the unique needs of diverse patient populations. Current approaches often fail to track outcome and process measures by important social disparity metrics, such as race/ethnicity and primary language. Despite these shortcomings, use of a QI structure has tremendous potential to address disparities in neonatal care. Crucial components of a QI approach to achieve health equity include: (1) Identifying equity goals from the inception of a project; (2) Inclusion of diverse family members on multidisciplinary teams; (3) Tracking outcome and process measures according to disparity metrics; and (4) Conducting interventions that preferentially address barriers of high-risk social groups. Hospital-system commitment to diversity and inclusion in the healthcare work force, recognition of the impact of unconscious provider bias and advocacy in the greater public health setting are needed to address underlying social inequities that impact neonatal care quality.</ab>

        <ab>The glaring racial inequities in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating loss of Black lives at the hands of police and racist vigilantes have catalyzed a global reckoning about deeply rooted systemic racism in society. Many medical training institutions in the United States have participated in this discourse by denouncing racism, expressing solidarity with people of color, and reexamining their diversity and inclusion efforts. Yet, the stagnant progress in recruiting, retaining, and supporting racial/ethnic minority trainees and faculty at medical training institutions is well documented and reflects unaddressed systemic racism along the academic pipeline. In this article, the authors draw upon their experiences as early-career physicians of color who have led and supported antiracism efforts within their institutions to highlight key barriers to achieving meaningful progress. They describe common pitfalls of diversity and inclusion initiatives and call for an antiracist approach to systems change. The authors then offer 9 recommendations that medical training institutions can implement to critically examine and address racist structures within their organizations to actualize racial equity and justice.</ab>

        <ab>As demand for diversity, equity and inclusion workshops has risen sharply this past year, I'm not the first to observe that the burden for finding solutions, ironically, gets inordinately placed at the feet of people of color. Ironic, of course, because changing the hearts and minds of Whites is a challenge that needs to be met by Whites. McIntosh's White privilege scale has inspired a growing number of other scales that help us examine our unconscious bias, privilege and advantages from our lived experiences. Deepening empathy for people of color is a prerequisite to being of any use whatsoever in a profession committed to health equity. An obvious way to cross the empathy chasm is to be sure those who are accountable for finding solutions have a deep affinity with those who are most directly affected by the problems. In my continued work to cross the empathy chasm, the space I take needs to be as someone intent on listening to, learning from and supporting those with empathy to spare.</ab>

        <ab>Women remain underrepresented within academic medicine despite past and present efforts to promote gender equity. The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.</ab>

        <ab>This study aims to evaluate the quality of the Portuguese Government's action in the health sector during Troika's intervention period (2011-2015), taking as criterion the concern with the application of Good Governance principles, in terms of degree and diversity. The intention is to understand the extent to which the public action promoted by the Ministry of Health has developed seeking to contribute to the strengthening of Good Governance practices. Fifty measures of the Ministry of Health, distributed by nine intervention areas, were analyzed, based on documental analysis, supported on the law and on other official documents. The principles of Good Governance that demonstrate a more transversal concern are clearly that of "transparency" and of "effectiveness/efficiency", present in eight of the nine intervention areas. The concern with "orientation to consensus" is essentially present in the measures classified as Agreements, "independence" in the Ethics area, the "strengthening of the rule of Law" in the Control area and "equity/inclusion" in the area of the Citizen in the Centre of the NHS.</ab>

        <ab>The Association of Academic Physiatrists convened a Women's Task Force in 2016, under the leadership of then Association of Academic Physiatrists President Gerard Francisco, MD, to evaluate data and metrics pertaining to the representation and inclusion of female physiatrists in the society. An initial published report focused on a retrospective analysis of data in categories such as leadership, conference presentations, and recognition awards. The findings, which highlighted areas in which the Association of Academic Physiatrists had been successful in supporting gender equity as well as areas in which female physiatrists were underrepresented, provided a base from which to strategically focus on closing gaps in representation. The task force developed an action plan that was approved by the Board of Trustees and included strategies aimed at closing gaps and collecting data to determine corresponding effectiveness. Because most of the categories fell under the supervision of various Association of Academic Physiatrists committees, an appointee from each committee ("diversity steward") liaised with the Women's Task Force. The diversity stewards reviewed the plan with their respective committees and collected data within their committee's purview. This task force follow-up report documents recent progress, consistent with the Association of Academic Physiatrists Board of Trustees commitment to transparency and gender equity.</ab>

        <ab>Our collective experience with COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter has heightened awareness of deeply embedded racial and socioeconomic disparities in American businesses. This time, perhaps, sustained change is within reach. As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity. The provided recommendations can support employer goals of achieving greater equity and value in workforce health, measurably contributing to business success.</ab>

        <ab>Recent events in America in 2020 have stimulated a worldwide movement to dismantle anti-Black racism in all facets of our lives. Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a "term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically." In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined "Visions" (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals. We would like to specifically acknowledge the Black women who took the time to be interviewed, write perspectives, and share their lived experiences in hopes that it will inspire genuine and lasting change.</ab>

        <ab>Research offers the potential for new treatments, programs and services, and underlies decisions about funding that can have profound implications for people's lives. When racism in research is not addressed, children and their families will be unjustly impacted by systemic discrimination, exclusion, and inequity. With a growing acknowledgement that racism is a social determinant of health, and as COVID-19 reveals staggering racial disparities, we believe now is the time for intentional anti-racism initiatives throughout the research ecosystem to prevent further harms in patient care and the lives and futures of children. We aim to highlight this need for justice, and conclude with a series of practical recommendations, ranging from the collection and use of race-based data, to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) education, to mentorship opportunities.</ab>

        <ab>Academic health centers have promoted initiatives to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in medicine. Despite this emphasis, there has been limited discussion on practical strategies for navigating bias within academic surgery. This study analyzes experiences of confronting bias within the department of surgery at the University of Michigan.</ab>
        <ab>We conducted telephone interviews (n = 15) from January 2019 to January 2020 with surgeon volunteers at one academic institution. Two investigators conducted interviews following a semi-structured guide based on personal experiences with bias between healthcare workers with diverse identities. Interviews were conducted concurrently with thematic coding, coded independently by two investigators, and discussed until consensus was reached. Analysis proceeded following the inductive and comparative approach of interpretive description.</ab>
        <ab>The most common incidents of bias were based on gender and race. They occurred along numerous relationship axes, including physician-patient and resident-faculty. A critical factor in bias response was unambiguously recognizing bias. Responding to bias consists of timing and nature of the response, defined as when the subject responded relative to the incident and the actions done in response to the incident respectively. Barriers to bias response were fear of retribution and extensive energy required to respond. Institutional culture was important, specifically in representation and support from peers and administration.</ab>
        <ab>This study probes deeper into equity and inclusivity in the academic field of surgery, offering insight into common barriers to confronting bias. Overall, these findings offer a basic framework for allies to identify bias and to partner with colleagues to address biases in a supportive manner.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity in the US physician workforce is important. Physicians Underrepresented in Medicine (UIM) are more likely to serve poor, uninsured, and vulnerable populations.</ab>
        <ab>To increase the number of UIM physicians in Occupational Medicine.</ab>
        <ab>An Inclusion and Diversity Committee, consisting of the program director, trainees, and graduates, was created with the goal of recruiting and developing UIM residents and increasing Occupational and Environmental Medicine awareness. Outreach to UIM residents and medical students at local, regional, and national meetings, creation and distribution of descriptive brochures, and supervised 1-day observerships were some of the interventions.</ab>
        <ab>Only 4 Underrepresented Minorities physicians out of 65 (6%) graduated during the first decade of the program 1997-2007; this increased to (16/70) 23% during the following decade subsequent to establishing the Inclusion and Diversity Committee.</ab>
        <ab>A multifaceted strategic approach can help increase UIM physician participation in graduate training programs, helping address health equity.</ab>

        <ab>Recognizing the need to teach concepts of health equity, diversity, and inclusion as a part of medical students' preclinical training, we developed a series of workshops in the first year of medical school that introduced students to issues of discrimination and inequity and their effects on health outcomes. This student-led, faculty-supported project, known as Critical Consciousness in Medicine (CCM), adopted critical consciousness as a guiding principle for student learning.</ab>
        <ab>Over the course of the 2018-2019 academic year, student leaders developed and delivered five 2-hour workshops to 197 first-year students, with the assistance of student facilitators and input and guidance from faculty advisors. Workshops involved a mix of whole-class presentations and small-group discussions. Session topics included identity and interpersonal relationships, privilege, health disparities, and implicit bias.</ab>
        <ab>Paired t -test analysis showed statistically significant growth in student self-ratings related to CCM learning objectives as measured in the end-of-year pre-/postsurvey. Student comments in year-end reflections further suggested learning, self-assessment, growth, and appreciation for the workshops' place in the preclinical curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>This project modeled a student-faculty partnership for approaching diversity, inclusion, and health equity in medical education and highlighted the role of students as leaders in educating their peers. The CCM workshop series demonstrated high acceptability as a component of preclinical medical education and may increase student engagement around social issues in health care. CCM also illustrated the promise of using critical consciousness as an approach to educating medical students about equity, diversity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>There is a large gender gap in critical care medicine with women underrepresented, particularly in positions of leadership. Yet gender diversity better reflects the current critical care community and has multiple beneficial effects at individual and societal levels. In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of the reasons for the persistent gender imbalance in critical care medicine, and suggest some possible strategies to help achieve greater equity and inclusion. An explicit and consistent focus on eliminating gender inequity is needed until gender diversity and inclusion become the norms in critical care medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Learning climate greatly affects student achievement. This qualitative study aimed to understand community definitions of climate; share lived experiences of students, faculty, and staff; and define priority areas of improvement in the University of Washington School of Public Health (UWSPH). Between March-May 2019, 17 focus group discussions were conducted-stratified by role and self-identified race/ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation-among 28 faculty/staff and 36 students. Topics included: assessing the current climate, recounting experiences related to roles and identities, and recommending improvements. Transcripts were coded using deductive and inductive approaches. Race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation appeared to affect perceptions of the climate, with nearly all respondents from underrepresented or minoritized groups recounting negative experiences related to their identity. Persons of color, women, and other respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) frequently perceived the climate as "uncomfortable." Most felt that UWSPH operates within a structural hierarchy that perpetuates white, male, and/or class privilege and "protects those in power" while leaving underrepresented or minoritized groups feeling like "the way to move up… is to conform" in order to not be seen as "someone pushing against the system." Improvement priorities included: increasing community responsiveness to diversity, equity, and inclusion; intentionally diversifying faculty/staff and student populations; designing inclusive curricula; and supporting underrepresented or minoritized groups academically, professionally, and psychologically.</ab>

        <ab>Fostering a diverse neuroscience workforce, as well as an environment that is inclusive for all, is critical to the advancement of science and the future of the field. On January 25, 2021, the Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine held a virtual workshop, convening a diverse range of stakeholders from across the neuroscience community and at different career stages. Participants tackled the broad topic of inclusion and diversity in neuroscience training to include discussions on racial equity (expanding on themes from the first workshop in the series), supporting a global workforce, institutional and geographic diversity, unique challenges for women in science, understanding how the goals of inclusion intersect with the goals around changing the culture of science. Discussions also considered the changes needed to move the field forward in this space. This workshop was the third in a series originating from the Action Collaborative on Neuroscience Training: Developing a Nimble and Versatile Workforce, an initiative of the Forum. The workshop series aims to illuminate critical issues and catalyze a reconsideration of how neuroscience training could be designed to meet current and future workforce needs across multiple sectors. This Proceedings of a Workshop-in Brief summarizes the discussions that occurred at the workshop.</ab>

        <ab>A diverse biomedical workforce is essential to achieve excellence in patient care, clinical translational, and basic research. Diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges in cancer molecular represent a combination of the challenges facing the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field, and challenges in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine. Although there is a growing awareness of conscious and unconscious bias that negatively affect the cancer imaging world, many challenges remain such as overcoming barriers to entry into the pipeline, avoiding program dropout, and providing long-term career prospect. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant setback and further highlighted problems faced by women and underrepresented minorities. In this perspective, we have identified some of the challenges faced and highlighted ongoing and future initiatives to address these challenges.</ab>

        <ab>As the specialty of cardiothoracic surgery turns the corner into its second century of existence, there has been an uptick in the number of women and underrepresented minorities entering the field, but we have a long way to go before race and gender equity prevails.</ab>
        <ab>In this report, specific barriers to diversity without exclusion and mechanisms to breakdown these barriers will be explored.</ab>
        <ab>Barriers to inclusion include a long-standing deficiency in exposure, encouragement, mentorship, and sponsorship to actively attract underrepresented groups to the specialty. Diversity will not occur passively. It will take a concerted effort best employed through a top-down approach at the local and national level, and it has to seem normal.</ab>
        <ab>Cardiothoracic surgery is an outstanding field for anyone and everyone who seeks a challenging, rewarding career, regardless of their gender, race, or ethnic background. It is the responsibility of leadership to dispel the tradition that certain individuals are not welcome.</ab>

        <ab>Many programs struggle to recruit, select, and match a diverse class of residents, and the most effective strategies for holistic review of applications to enhance diversity are not clear.</ab>
        <ab>We determined if holistic pediatric residency application review guided by frameworks that assess for bias along structural, interpersonal, and individual levels would increase the number of matched residents from racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in medicine (UiM).</ab>
        <ab>Between 2017 and 2020, University of California San Francisco Pediatrics Department identified structural, interpersonal, and individual biases in existing selection processes and developed mitigation strategies in each area. Interventions included creating a shared mental model of desirable qualities in residents, employing a new scoring rubric, intentional inclusion of UiM faculty and trainees in the selection process, and requiring anti-bias training for everyone involved with recruitment and selection.</ab>
        <ab>Since implementing these changes, the percentage of entering interns who self-identify as UIM increased from 11% in 2015 to 45% (OR 6.8, P = .008) in 2019 and to 35% (OR 4.6, P = .035) in 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Using an equity framework to guide implementation of a pediatric residency program's holistic review of applications increased the numbers of matched UiM residents over a 3-year period.</ab>

        <ab>Using information gathered from a focus group with DHM faculty, an iterative strategic plan for DEI was developed and deployed, with key components of focus being institutional structures, our people, our environments, and our core mission areas. A director of DEI was established to help oversee these efforts. Using a two-phase approach, salary disparities by rank were eliminated. Internally funded protected time was standardized for leadership roles. A data dashboard has been developed to track high-level successes and areas for future focus.</ab>
        <ab>Using a systematic evidence-based approach with key stakeholder involvement, a division-wide DEI strategy was developed and implemented. While this work is ongoing, short-term wins are possible, in particular around salary equity and development of policies and structures to promote DEI.</ab>

        <ab>Contemporary curricular reform in medical education focuses on areas that current physician-educators were likely not exposed to during medical school, such as interprofessional teamwork; informatics; health care systems improvement; and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, faculty may not be ready to support the planned curricular reform without adequate faculty development to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. In an era with increasing demands on faculty, new approaches that are flexible and adaptable are needed. The University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine implemented a new curriculum in 2016, which constituted a major curricular overhaul necessitating extensive faculty development. Based on this experience, the author proposes 8 guiding principles for faculty development around curricular reform: (1) create a blueprint to inform design and implementation of faculty development activities; (2) build on existing resources, networks, and communities; (3) target different needs and competency levels for different groups of faculty; (4) encourage cocreation in the workplace; (5) promote collaboration between content experts and faculty developers; (6) tap into faculty's intrinsic motivation for professional development; (7) develop curriculum leaders and faculty developers; and (8) evaluate for continuous improvement. Each of these principles is illustrated with examples, and when available, supported by references to relevant literature. Considering the current wave of curricular reform, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, these principles can be useful for other institutions.</ab>

        <ab>For individuals aspiring to a career in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, mentorship can shape destiny. Mentorship helps assure safe passage into the specialty, and it influences the arc of professional development across the career continuum. Even before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, technology and social networking were transforming mentorship in otolaryngology. Now, in an increasingly virtual world, where in-person interactions are the exception, mentorship plays an even more pivotal role. Mentors serve as trusted guides, helping learners navigate accelerating trends toward early specialization, competency-based assessments, and key milestones. However, several structural barriers render the playing field unlevel. For medical students, cancellation of visiting clerkships, in-person rotations, and other face-to-face interactions may limit access to mentors. The pandemic and virtual landscape particularly threaten the already-leaky pipeline for underrepresented medical students. These challenges may persist into residency and later career stages, where structural inequities continue to subtly influence opportunities and pairings of mentors and mentees. Hence, overreliance on serendipitous encounters can exacerbate disparities, even amid societal mandates for equity. The decision to take deliberate steps toward mentoring outreach and engagement has profound implications for what otolaryngology will look like in years to come. This article introduces the concept of new age mentoring, shining a light on how to modernize practices. The key shifts are from passive to active engagement; from amorphous to structured relationships; and from hierarchical dynamics to bidirectional mentoring. Success is predicated on intentional outreach and purposefulness in championing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the progressively technology-driven landscape.</ab>

        <ab>We sought to evaluate common leadership experiences and academic achievements obtained by current U.S. Medical School Deans of Medicine (DOMs) prior to their first appointment as Dean in order to elucidate a common pathway for promotion.</ab>
        <ab>In April-June 2019 the authors requested a curriculum vitae from each of the 153 LCME-accredited U.S. Medical School DOMs. The authors abstracted data on prior appointments, demographics, and achievements from CVs and online databases. Differences by gender and institutional rank were then evaluated by the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.</ab>
        <ab>CVs were obtained for 62% of DOMs (95 of 153), with women comprising 16% of the responding cohort (15/95). Prior to appointment as DOM, 34% of respondents had served as both permanent Department Chair and Associate Dean, 39% as permanent Department Chair but not Associate Dean, and 17% as Associate Deans but not permanent Department Chair. There was a non-significant trend for men to have been more likely to have been a permanent Department Chair (76% vs 53%, p = 0.11) and less likely to have been an Associate Dean (48% vs 67%, p = 0.26) compared to women. Responding DOMs at Top-25 research institutions were mostly male (15/16), more likely to have been appointed before 2010 (38% vs 14%, p = 0.025), and had higher H-indices (mean (SD): 73.1 (32.3) vs 33.5 (22.5), p&lt;0.01) than non-Top-25 Deans.</ab>
        <ab>The most common pathway to DOM in this study cohort was prior service as Department Chair. This suggests that diversification among Department Chair positions or expansion of search criteria to seek leaders from pools other than Department Chairs may facilitate increased diversity, equity, and inclusion among DOM overall.</ab>

        <ab>Scientific authorship is a vital marker of achievement in academic careers and gender equity is a key performance metric in research. However, there is little understanding of gender equity in publications in biomedical research centres funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). This study assesses the gender parity in scientific authorship of biomedical research.</ab>
        <ab>Descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective bibliometric study.</ab>
        <ab>NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).</ab>
        <ab>Data comprised 2409 publications that were either accepted or published between April 2012 and March 2017. The publications were classified as basic science studies, clinical studies (both trial and non-trial studies) and other studies (comments, editorials, systematic reviews, reviews, opinions, book chapters, meeting reports, guidelines and protocols).</ab>
        <ab>Gender of authors, defined as a binary variable comprising either male or female categories, in six authorship categories: first author, joint first authors, first corresponding author, joint corresponding authors, last author and joint last authors.</ab>
        <ab>Publications comprised 39% clinical research (n=939), 27% basic research (n=643) and 34% other types of research (n=827). The proportion of female authors as first author (41%), first corresponding authors (34%) and last author (23%) was statistically significantly lower than male authors in these authorship categories (p&lt;0.001). Of total joint first authors (n=458), joint corresponding authors (n=169) and joint last authors (n=229), female only authors comprised statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) smaller proportions, that is, 15% (n=69), 29% (n=49) and 10% (n=23) respectively, compared with male only authors in these joint authorship categories. There was a statistically significant association between gender of the last author with gender of the first author (p&lt;0.001), first corresponding author (p&lt;0.001) and joint last author (p&lt;0.001). The mean journal impact factor (JIF) was statistically significantly higher when the first corresponding author was male compared with female (Mean JIF: 10.00 vs 8.77, p=0.020); however, the JIF was not statistically different when there were male and female authors as first authors and last authors.</ab>
        <ab>Although the proportion of female authors is significantly lower than the proportion of male authors in all six categories of authorship analysed, the proportions of male and female last authors are comparable to their respective proportions as principal investigators in the BRC. These findings suggest positive trends and the NIHR Oxford BRC doing very well in gender parity in the senior (last) authorship category. Male corresponding authors are more likely to publish articles in prestigious journals with high impact factor while both male and female authors at first and last authorship positions publish articles in equally prestigious journals.</ab>

        <ab>Medical students often feel unprepared to care for patients whose cultural backgrounds differ from their own. Programs in medical schools have begun to address health: inequities; however, interventions vary in intensity, effectiveness, and student experience.</ab>
        <ab>The authors describe an intensive 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum for medical students in their orientation week prior to starting formal classes. Rather than using solely a knowledge-based "cultural competence" or a reflective "cultural humility" approach, an experiential curriculum was employed that links directly to fundamental communication skills vital to interactions with patients and teams, and critically important to addressing interpersonal disparities. Specifically, personal narratives were incorporated to promote individuation and decrease implicit bias, relationship-centered skills practice to improve communication across differences, and mindfulness skills to help respond to bias when it occurs. Brief didactics highlighting student and faculty narratives of difference were followed by small group sessions run by faculty trained to facilitate sessions on equity and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>Orientation week for matriculating first-year students at a US medical school.</ab>
        <ab>Matriculating students highly regarded an innovative 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion orientation curriculum that emphasized significant relationship-building with peers, in addition to core concepts and skills in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>This orientation represented an important primer to concepts, skills, and literature that reinforce the necessity of training in diversity, equity, and inclusion. The design team found that intensive faculty development and incorporating diversity concepts into fundamental communication skills training were necessary to perpetuate this learning. Two areas of further work emerged: (1) the emphasis on addressing racism and racial equity as paradigmatic belies further essential understanding of intersectionality, and (2) uncomfortable conversations about privilege and marginalization arose, requiring expert facilitation.</ab>

        <ab>Trainees and investigators from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds face unique challenges to establishing successful careers in clinical and translational research. Structured training for mentors is an important mechanism to increase the diversity of the research workforce. This article presents data from an evaluation of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Mentoring the Mentors program aimed at improving mentors' competency in working with diverse mentees in HIV research.</ab>
        <ab>Mentors from around the USA who had in one of seven separate 2-day training workshops conducted from 2013 to 2020 were invited to participate in an online evaluation survey of their experiences with the training and their subsequent mentoring activities.</ab>
        <ab>There was a high response rate (80%) among the 226 mentors invited to complete the survey. The 180 respondents were diverse in demographics, professional disciplines, and geographic distribution. Quantitative and qualitative data indicate a lasting positive impact of the training, with sustained improvements documented on a validated measure of self-appraised mentoring competency. Respondents also endorsed high interest in future, follow-up training with continued focus on topics related to mentoring in the context of diversity.</ab>
        <ab>The evaluation of the UCSF CFAR Mentoring the Mentors program showed lasting impact in improving mentoring practices, coupled with high interest in continued in-depth training in areas focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>As we build a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture in the ecological research community, we must work to support new ecologists by empowering them with the knowledge, tools, validation, and sense of belonging in ecology to succeed. Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are critical for a student's professional and interpersonal skill development and key for recruiting and retaining students from diverse groups to ecology. However, few resources exist that speak directly to an undergraduate researcher on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) dimensions of embarking on a first research experience. Here, we write primarily for undergraduate readers, though a broader audience of readers, especially URE mentors, will also find this useful. We explain many of the ways a URE benefits undergraduate researchers and describe how URE students from different positionalities can contribute to an inclusive research culture. We address three common sources of anxiety for URE students through a DEI lens: imposter syndrome, communicating with mentors, and safety in fieldwork. We discuss the benefits as well as the unique vulnerabilities and risks associated with fieldwork, including the potential for harassment and assault. Imposter syndrome and toxic field experiences are known to drive students, including students from underrepresented minority groups, out of STEM. Our goal is to encourage all students, including those from underrepresented groups, to apply for UREs, build awareness of their contributions to inclusion in ecology research, and provide strategies for overcoming known barriers.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion represent interconnected goals meant to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their innate identity characteristics, feel welcomed and valued among their peers. Equity is achieved when all individuals have equal access to leadership and career advancement opportunities as well as fair compensation for their work. It is well-known that the unique backgrounds and perspectives contributed by a diverse workforce strengthen and improve medical organizations overall. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) is committed to supporting the highest quality leadership, patient care, surgical education, and societal recommendations through promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the SVS. The overarching goal of this document is to provide specific context and guidance for enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within the SVS as well as setting the tone for conduct and processes beyond the SVS, within other national and regional vascular surgery organizations and practice settings.</ab>

        <ab>Increasing the diversity of family medicine residency programs includes matriculating residents with disabilities. Accrediting agencies and associations provide mandates and recommendations to assist programs with building inclusive policies and practices. The purpose of this study was (1) to assess programs' compliance with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates and alignment with Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) best practices; (2) to understand perceptions of sources of accommodation funding; and (3) to document family medicine chairs' primary source of disability-related information.</ab>
        <ab>Data were collected as part of the 2019 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance Chairs' Survey. Respondents answered questions about disability policy, disability disclosure structure, source of accommodation funding, and source of information regarding disability.</ab>
        <ab>Half (56%) of responding chairs reported maintaining a disability policy in alignment with ACGME mandates, while half (52%) maintain a disability disclosure structure in opposition to AAMC recommendations. Funding sources for accommodation were reported as unknown (32.9%), the hospital system (27.1%), or the departmental budget (24.3%). Chairs listed human resources (50.7%) or diversity, equity, and inclusion offices (23.9%) as the main sources of disability guidance.</ab>
        <ab>The number of students with disabilities in medical education is growing, increasing the likelihood that family medicine residency programs will select and train residents with disabilities. Results from this study suggest an urgent need to review disability policy and processes within departments to ensure alignment with current guidance on disability inclusion. Department chairs, as institutional leaders, are well positioned to lead this change.</ab>

        <ab>"Bring your whole self to work" remains a common mantra of supporters of workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI").1 For example, disability rights advocates have long contended that hiding or downplaying one's disability from one's colleagues at work "create[s] an invisible layer of additional work for the individual" in being accepted at the job and negatively affects productivity.2 LGBTQ+ rights advocates have raised similar points, noting that hiding or downplaying one's sexual orientation or gender identity from one's colleagues hinders internal advancement of LGBTQ+ workers.3 As recently as 2019, however, a Deloitte study found that sixty-one percent of workers hid or downplayed one or more of their identities from their colleagues at work.4.</ab>

        <ab>A diverse physician workforce improves the quality of care for all patients, and there is a need for greater diversity in orthopaedic surgery. It is important that medical students of diverse backgrounds be encouraged to pursue the specialty, but to do so, we must understand students' perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics. We also currently lack knowledge about how participation in an orthopaedic clinical rotation might influence these perceptions.</ab>
        <ab>(1) How do the perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedic surgery compare among medical students of different gender identities, races or ethnicities, and sexual orientations? (2) How do perceptions change after an orthopaedic clinical rotation among members of demographic groups who are not the majority in orthopaedics (that is, cis-gender women, underrepresented racial minorities, other racial minorities, and nonheterosexual people)?</ab>
        <ab>We surveyed students from 27 US medical schools who had completed orthopaedic rotations. We asked about their demographic characteristics, rotation experience, perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics, and personal views on specialty choice. Questions were derived from diversity, equity, and inclusion climate surveys used at major academic institutions. Cis-gender men and cis-gender women were defined as those who self-identified their gender as men or women, respectively, and were not transgender. Forty-five percent (59 of 131) of respondents were cis-men and 53% (70 of 131) were cis-women; 49% (64 of 131) were white, 20% (26 of 131) were of underrepresented racial minorities, and 31% (41 of 131) were of other races. Eighty-five percent (112 of 131) of respondents were heterosexual and 15% (19 of 131) reported having another sexual orientation. We compared prerotation and postrotation perceptions of diversity and inclusion between majority and nonmajority demographic groups for each demographic domain (for example, cis-men versus cis-women). We also compared prerotation to postrotation perceptions within each nonmajority demographic group. To identify potential confounding variables, we performed univariate analysis to compare student and rotation characteristics across the demographic groups, assessed using an alpha of 0.05. No potential confounders were identified. Statistical significance was assessed at a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of 0.0125. Our estimated response percentage was 26%. To determine limitations of nonresponse bias, we compared all early versus late responders and found that for three survey questions, late responders had a more favorable perception of diversity in orthopaedic surgery, whereas for most questions, there was no difference.</ab>
        <ab>Before rotation, cis-women had lower agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic culture (mean score 0.96 ± 0.75) compared with cis-men (1.4 ± 1.1) (mean difference 0.48 [95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.81]; p = 0.004), viewed orthopaedic surgery as less diverse (cis-women 0.71 ± 0.73 versus cis-men 1.2 ± 0.92; mean difference 0.49 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.78]; p = 0.001) and more sexist (cis-women 1.3 ± 0.92 versus cis-men 1.9 ± 1.2; mean difference 0.61 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.99]; p = 0.002), believed they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally (cis-women 2.8 ± 1.0 versus cis-men 1.9 ± 1.3; mean difference 0.87 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.3]; p &lt; 0.001), and were less likely to pursue orthopaedic surgery (cis-women 1.4 ± 1.4 versus cis-men 2.6 ± 1.1; mean difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.6]; p &lt; 0.001). Before rotation, underrepresented minorities had less agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (0.73 ± 0.72) compared with white students (1.5 ± 0.97) (mean difference 0.72 [95% CI 0.35 to 1.1]; p &lt; 0.001). Many of these differences between nonmajority and majority demographic groups ceased to exist after rotation. Compared with their own prerotation beliefs, after rotation, cis-women believed more that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (prerotation mean score 0.96 ± 0.75 versus postrotation mean score 1.2 ± 0.96; mean difference 0.60 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.98]; p = 0.002) and that orthopaedic surgery is friendlier (prerotation 2.3 ± 1.2 versus postrotation 2.6 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.41 [95% CI 0.14 to 0.69]; p = 0.004), more diverse (prerotation 0.71 ± 0.73 versus postrotation 1.0 ± 0.89; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.49]; p = 0.007), less sexist (prerotation 1.3 ± 0.92 versus postrotation 1.9 ± 1.0; mean difference 0.63 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.85]; p &lt; 0.001), less homophobic (prerotation 2.1 ± 1.0 versus postrotation 2.4 ± 0.97; mean difference 0.27 [95% CI 0.062 to 0.47]; p = 0.011), and less racist (prerotation 2.3 ± 1.1 versus postrotation 2.5 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.099 to 0.47]; p = 0.003). Compared with before rotation, after rotation cis-women believed less that they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally on the rotation (prerotation 2.8 ± 1.0 versus postrotation 2.5 ± 1.0; mean difference 0.31 [95% CI 0.12 to 0.50]; p = 0.002), as did nonheterosexual students (prerotation 2.4 ± 1.4 versus postrotation 1.8 ± 1.3; mean difference 0.56 [95% 0.21 to 0.91]; p = 0.004). Underrepresented minority students saw orthopaedic surgery as less sexist after rotation compared with before rotation (prerotation 1.5 ± 1.1 versus postrotation 2.0 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.52 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.89]; p = 0.007).</ab>
        <ab>Even with an estimated 26% response percentage, we found that medical students of demographic backgrounds who are not the majority in orthopaedics generally perceived that orthopaedic surgery is less diverse and inclusive than do their counterparts in majority groups, but these views often change after a clinical orthopaedic rotation.</ab>
        <ab>These perceptions may be a barrier to diversification of the pool of medical student applicants to orthopaedics. However, participation in an orthopaedic surgery rotation is associated with mitigation of many of these negative perceptions among diverse students. Medical schools have a responsibility to develop a diverse workforce, and given our findings, schools should promote participation in a clinical orthopaedic rotation. Residency programs and orthopaedic organizations can also increase exposure to the field through the rotation and other means. Doing so may ultimately diversify the orthopaedic surgeon workforce and improve care for all orthopaedic patients.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") in the workplace is a complex issue at any time and in any organization. However, in this time of great upheaval-COVID-19, a renewed racial reckoning in the United States, and increased climate consciousness and social justice awareness-profound issues about work and the role of organizations are being raised simultaneously. This confluence of systemic issues highlights three critically important broad concepts that can help evolve our approach to addressing workplace inequities.</ab>

        <ab>Patient and public engagement (PPE) in research is growing internationally, and with it, the interest for its evaluation. In Canada, the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research has generated national momentum and opportunities for greater PPE in research and health-system transformation. As is the case with most countries, the Canadian research community lacks a common evaluation framework for PPE, thus limiting our capacity to ensure integrity between principles and practices, learn across projects, identify common areas for improvement, and assess the impacts of engagement.</ab>
        <ab>This project aims to build a national adaptable framework for the evaluation of PPE in research, by: 1. Building consensus on common evaluation criteria and indicators for PPE in research; 2. Defining recommendations to implement and adapt the framework to specific populations.</ab>
        <ab>Using a collaborative action-research approach, a national coalition of patient-oriented research leaders, (patient and community partners, engagement practitioners, researchers and health system leaders) will co-design the evaluation framework. We will develop core evaluation domains of the logic model by conducting a series of virtual consensus meetings using a nominal group technique with 50 patient partners and engagement practitioners, identified through 18 national research organizations. We will then conduct two Delphi rounds to prioritize process and impact indicators with 200 participants purposely recruited to include respondents from seldom-heard groups. Six expert working groups will define recommendations to implement and adapt the framework to research with specific populations, including Indigenous communities, immigrants, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, caregivers, and people with low literacy. Each step of framework development will be guided by an equity, diversity and inclusion approach in an effort to ensure that the participants engaged, the content produced, and the adaptation strategies proposed are relevant to diverse PPE.</ab>
        <ab>The potential contributions of this project are threefold: 1) support a national learning environment for engagement by offering a common blueprint for collaborative evaluation to the Canadian research community; 2) inform the international research community on potential (virtual) methodologies to build national consensus on common engagement evaluation frameworks; and 3) illustrate a shared attempt to engage patients and researchers in a strategic national initiative to strengthen evaluation capacity for PPE.</ab>

        <ab>As an integrative discipline, neuroscience can serve as a vehicle for the development of integrative thinking skills and broad-based scientific proficiency in undergraduate students. Undergraduate neuroscience curricula incorporate fundamental concepts from multiple disciplines. Deepening the explicit exploration of these connections in a neuroscience core curriculum has the potential to support more meaningful and successful undergraduate STEM learning for neuroscience students. Curriculum and faculty development activities related to an integrative core curriculum can provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines and departments to advance common goals of inclusive excellence in STEM. These efforts facilitate analysis of the institutional STEM curriculum from the student perspective, and assist in creating an internal locus of accountability for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the institution. Faculty at the College of the Holy Cross have undertaken the collaborative design and implementation of an integrative core curriculum for neuroscience that embraces principles of inclusive pedagogy, emphasizes the connections between neuroscience and other disciplines, and guides students to develop broad proficiency in fundamental STEM concepts and skills.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs.</ab>
        <ab>We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data.</ab>
        <ab>Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency. Modern GSSO information practices depend on and reinforce SGM competency in health care.</ab>

        <ab>Alliance governance is a form of governance developed in industry settings and more recently applied to healthcare. The core idea behind alliance governance is to involve the many stakeholders in the system to collaboratively develop a joint programme that promotes an integrated and whole of systems approach to care. Little is known about the model in healthcare, nor what those involved in an alliance should be focused upon. Using a modified Delphi method, this research presents a set of components that research participants agreed should underpin development of an effective alliance governance arrangement. These characteristics include a systems perspective-a truly shared governance protocol based on a shared vision and a common purpose; performance measurement-collecting and using real-time data that depicts the realities of an end-to-end system to establish better and more achievable goals based on alliance performance; a relational perspective to promote trust, respect and collaboration amongst alliance members, who historically have been competing for contracts and resources; structural changes that enable and promote a shared governance system; and, finally, equity and inclusion to ensure a diverse alliance which promotes diversity of ideas, and involvement of all stakeholders in the decision making process. This research is relevant to policymakers seeking to develop effective alliance-type arrangements as well as to those involved in the practice of alliance governance.</ab>

        <ab>The year 2020 has been one of challenges and change. Nursing professional development practitioners are being called to action to purposefully address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I). This article provides insight into how practitioners and administrators can work to create an environment of DE&amp;I that starts with awareness and culminates in creating a nursing workforce and practice environment that reflects the values and beliefs of our profession.

        <ab>There has been an increased focus on diversity and inclusion in medicine in recent years-the field of medicine still has a long way to go to reach gender equity. We assess how paediatrics is performing by examining the role gender plays in our specialty; and we propose some practical solutions to reach an equitable state. Achieving gender equity is not a simple or easy option and will require an ongoing commitment from all facets of the profession.</ab>

        <ab>Scientific societies have the potential to catalyze support for communities that have been historically excluded from science. Many of these societies have formed committees to propose and administer initiatives to promote the career and well-being of their members, with a special emphasis on racial and ethnic minorities. Yet, these societies are rarely armed with data to inform their proposals. Three of the evolution societies (American Society of Naturalists, "ASN"; Society of Systematic Biologists, "SSB"; Society for the Study of Evolution, "SSE") have also formed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committees in the last few years. As a first step in determining the needs of the societies, these committees collected data on the demographic characteristics of the societies' constituents by surveying the attendants of the Evolution 2019 meeting. Here, we report the proportions for different demographic groups in attendance at the meeting and compare these proportions to the demographics of recipients of Ph.D. degrees either in evolutionary biology or in the broader life sciences, as well as population demographics of the USA. Our results indicate that historically excluded groups are still underrepresented across US-based evolutionary biology professional societies. We explore whether demographic composition differs at different professional stages and find that representation for women and LGBTQ+ members decreases as the career stage progresses. We also find some evidence for heterogeneity across societies in terms of racial composition. Finally, we discuss the caveats and limitations of our procedures. Our results will serve to inform future efforts to collect demographic data at the society levels, which should in turn be used to design and implement evidence-based initiatives for inclusion and equity. This report should be a starting point for systematic efforts to characterize the ever-changing representation in evolutionary biology and to work toward the inclusion of all groups.</ab>

        <ab>In the era of COVID-19, coupled with a community in tune to Black lives, the call to action is now. It is now time to stop, listen, and be intentional in efforts to create sustainable policies and programs that shape the ability to deliver culturally competent care to diverse patients, families, professionals, and communities. Our recommendations for how faculty and academia can decolonize nursing education are delineated in this article. All nursing schools and departments should form a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committee, if they have not already done so. DEI committees can help thread Social Determinants of Health throughout the curriculum, highlight and address microaggressions, and develop formal and informal mentorship programs. As nurses, we must continue the discussion of race with humility but without denial and defensiveness. Subtle racist biases may be unintentionally internalized, and it is our moral and ethical responsibility to recognize these and fight them so that they do not result in prejudicial policy, practice, research, and education. Faculty should celebrate diversity through an exchange of ideas and open communication despite differences in race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, social class, or disability.</ab>

        <ab>Children of Māori &amp; Pacific Islander descent living in Australia have a greater prevalence of overweight/obesity and an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to co-design Healthier Together, a community-based, childhood overweight/obesity prevention program tailored to Māori &amp; Pacific Islander cultures.</ab>
        <ab>Co-design involved a three-phase, iterative, participatory and experience-based process, guided by the Te Ara Tika: Guidelines for Māori Research Ethics to promote respect and equity. Following traditional oratory customs of Māori &amp; Pacific Islander cultures, "talanoa" facilitated the collaborative program design with recruited Māori &amp; Pacific Islander consumers, cultural advisors and health professionals. Co-design formulated program objectives, session plans, resources and evaluation tools.</ab>
        <ab>Co-design developed a 9-week community-based childhood overweight/obesity prevention program providing culturally tailored education across four themes: (a) nutrition (b) physical activity (c) positive parenting practices (d) culture and health. Strong community engagement developed a program highly tailored to the local Māori &amp; Pacific Islander population.</ab>
        <ab>Co-design methodology promotes equity and inclusion of all stakeholders, acknowledges and caters to diversity and creates a medium for openness, respect and shared purpose. Community-led participatory approaches are pivotal to engaging and empowering communities to successfully improve health behaviours, particularly in tackling childhood overweight/obesity. SO WHAT?: Healthier Together is culturally significant to ensure relevance, effectiveness and sustainability. It is relevant and potentially adaptable to other priority populations across Australia and globally. Ultimately, the delivery of culturally tailored health care will contribute to a reduction in the health inequity experienced amongst priority populations.</ab>

        <ab>Academic Neurology Departments must confront the challenges of developing a diverse workforce, reducing inequity and discrimination within academia, and providing neurologic care for an increasingly diverse society. A neurology diversity officer should have a specific role and associated title within a neurology department as well as a mandate to focus their efforts on issues of equity, diversity and inclusion that affect staff, trainees and faculty. This role is expansive and works across departmental missions but it has many challenges related to structural intolerance and cultural gaps. In this review, we describe the many challenges that diversity officers face and how they might confront them. We delineate the role and duties of the neurology diversity officer and provide a guide to departmental leaders on how to assess qualifications and evaluate progress. Finally, we describe the elements necessary for success. A neurology diversity officer should have the financial, administrative and emotional support of leadership in order for them to carry out their mission and to truly have a positive influence.</ab>

        <ab>To mitigate the impact of racism, sexism, and other systemic biases, it is essential for organizations to develop strategies to address their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) climates. The objective of this formative evaluation was to assess Mayo Clinic Department of Health Sciences Research (HSR) faculty and staff perceptions toward a proposed departmental DEI plan and to explore findings by diversity and professional subgroups.</ab>
        <ab>Key plan components include recruitment and support for diverse individuals; training for all HSR employees and leaders; and a review system to capture diversity and inclusion feedback for leaders. Additional activities include building inclusion "nudges" into existing performance reviews. To assess pre-implementation beliefs about specific plan components, we polled attendees at a departmental staff meeting in July 2020.</ab>
        <ab>Overall, respondents ( n = 162) commonly endorsed a blinded promotion review process and DEI training for all staff and leaders as most important. In contrast, respondents expressed less support for plan activities related to "nudges." However, attitudes among certain diversity or professional groups toward specific plan activities diverged from their non-diversity group counterparts. Qualitative feedback indicated awareness of the need to address DEI issues.</ab>
        <ab>Overall, HSR faculty and staff respondents conveyed support for the plan. However, some specific plan activities were perceived differently by members of certain diversity or professional subgroups.</ab>
        <ab>These findings present a DEI framework on which other institutions can build and point to future directions for how DEI activities may be differentially perceived by impacted faculty and staff.</ab>

        <ab>BACKGROUND: Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) have an increased risk for polypharmacy, premature mortality, and early development of several morbidities, including conditions associated with excess medication exposure, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and liver disease. To date, very little is known about the consequence of polypharmacy for adults with CP. OBJECTIVE: To determine if polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk for mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease among adults with CP, before and after adjusting for comorbid neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) and multimorbidity. METHODS: This is an exploratory treatment effectiveness study. Data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart were used for this retrospective cohort study. Adults aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of CP and without severe CKD (stages IV+) and liver disease were identified from the calendar year 2013 and were subsequently followed from January 1, 2014, to death, severe CKD, liver disease, loss to follow-up, or end of study period (December 31, 2017). Diagnosis codes were used to identify NDDs (intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, spina bifida) and 24 relevant morbidities at baseline (i.e., calendar year 2013). Polypharmacy was defined as ≥ 5 medications and hyperpolypharmacy was defined as ≥ 10 medications at baseline. Cox regression models were developed to examine the association (as HR and 95% CI) between polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy with mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease separately, before and after adjusting for covariates (demographics, NDDs, multimorbidity). Exploratory analyses examined the mediating effect of incident severe CKD or liver disease on the association between the exposure (polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy) on outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 9,238 adults with CP, 58.5% had polypharmacy and 29.5% had hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for mortality was 2.14 (95% CI = 1.59-2.89) for polypharmacy and 1.65 (95% CI = 1.31-2.09) for hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for severe CKD was 1.66 (95% CI = 1.17-2.36) for polypharmacy and 1.67 (95% CI = 1.27-2.19) for hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for liver disease was 1.57 (95% CI = 1.27-1.94) for polypharmacy and 1.72 (95% CI = 1.42-2.08) for hyperpolypharmacy. Incident liver disease mediated 5.37% (polypharmacy) and 7.54% (hyperpolypharmacy) of the association between the exposure with incident severe CKD for nonelderly (aged &lt; 65 years), while incident severe CKD mediated 7.05% (polypharmacy) and 6.64% (hyperpolypharmacy) of the association between the exposure with incident liver disease for elderly (aged ≥ 65 years). CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are robust risk factors for risk of mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease among privately insured adults with CP. While incidence of severe CKD and liver disease had negligible effects on the association between polypharmacy with mortality, there is evidence that they mediate a considerable portion of one another and require further examination. DISCLOSURES: During the work for this study, Whitney was supported by the University of Michigan Office of Health Equity and Inclusion Diversity Fund and American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine. The funding sources had no role in the design or conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</ab>

        <ab>The rapid rise of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the implementation of public health measures on an unprecedented scale. These measures have significantly affected the training environment and the mental health of health care providers and learners. Design thinking offers creative and innovative solutions to emergent complex problems, including those related to training and patient care that have arisen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design thinking can accelerate the development and implementation of solution prototypes through a process of inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Digital technology can be leveraged as part of this process to provide care and education in new or enhanced ways. Online knowledge hubs, videoconference-based interactive sessions, virtual simulations, and technology-enhanced coaching for health care providers are potential solutions to address identified issues. Limitations of this model include inherent bias toward utilitarian instead of egalitarian principles and the subsequent threat to diversity, equity, and inclusion in solutions. Although medical educators have embraced digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to ensure that these changes are sustained.</ab>

        <ab>In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, current Association of American Medical Colleges guidelines discourage away rotations, posing significant challenges for attracting students to radiation oncology (RO). This is particularly concerning for medical students underrepresented in medicine (UIM) due to the potential of widening existing disparities in applicant and workforce composition. To proactively address this, we created a Radiation Oncology Intensive Shadowing Experience (RISE) to expose UIM students to the field of RO.</ab>
        <ab>Key stakeholders within the residency program, including both UIM faculty and residents with experience in health disparities and medical education, designed a 1-week virtual RISE intended for fourth year UIM students recruited through established national organizations serving UIM medical students. A 1-week disease-specific curriculum was developed using 4 components: (1) foundational exposure to RO, (2) didactic teaching, (3) mentorship opportunities, and (4) a capstone experience. Mentorship was continuously weaved through the experience by attendings, peer resident mentors, and a UIM resident panel to optimize exposure.</ab>
        <ab>RISE was successfully initiated at 2 academic medical centers with 12 UIM students enrolled through August. Anonymized pre- and postclerkship surveys were developed for students, residents, and faculty involved in RISE to evaluate participants' satisfaction, resident and attending time burden, and perceptions of program effectiveness.</ab>
        <ab>We created a unique virtual RO shadowing experience for UIM students to address a critical gap in exposure to RO, heightened by the corona virus disease 2019 pandemic, with the goal of improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.</ab>

        <ab> Strengthening Our Commitment to Racial and Social Justice to Improve Public Health The fourth annual summer research summit organized by the Center of Excellence (COE) in Health Equity, Training and Research, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) was held on May 20, 2021. The theme of this year's summit was 'Strengthening Our Commitment to Racial and Social Justice to Improve Public Health.' Given the ongoing pandemic, the summit was conducted virtually through digital platforms. This program was intended for both BCM and external audiences interested in advancing health equity, diversity and inclusion in healthcare among healthcare providers and trainees, biomedical scientists, social workers, nurses, individuals involved in talent acquisition and development such as hiring managers (HR professionals), supervisors, college and hospital affiliate leadership and administrators, as well as diversity and inclusion excellence practitioners. We had attendees from all regions of the United States, India, Pakistan and the Demographic Republic of the Congo. The content in this Book of Abstracts encapsulates a summary of the research efforts by the BCM COE scholars (which includes post-baccalaureate students, medical students, clinical fellows and junior faculty from BCM) as well as the external summit participants. The range of topics in this year's summit was quite diverse encompassing disparities in relation to maternal and child health (MCH), immigrant heath, cancers, vaccination uptakes and COVID-19 infections. Various solutions were ardently presented to address these disparities including community engagement and partnerships, improvement in health literacy and development of novel technologies and therapeutics. With this summit, BCM continues to build on its long history of educational outreach initiatives to promote diversity in medicine by focusing on programs aimed at increasing the number of diverse and highly qualified medical professionals ready to introduce effective and innovative approaches to reduce or eliminate health disparities. These programs will improve information resources, clinical education, curricula, research and cultural competence as they relate to minority health issues and social determinants of health. The summit received very positive response in terms of zealous participation and outstanding evaluations; and overall, it was a great success. Copyright © 2021 Dongarwar et al.

        <ab>Diversity work is an area of growing interest for organisations in both the private and public sectors. In a nutshell, the term refers to the work conducted within an organisation that promotes inclusive and equitable engagement with people and communities across social differences such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and religion. Related research has generated relatively more knowledge about the challenges and problems of diversity initiatives than about effective practices that genuinely foster social equity and inclusion. This article contributes to the latter with a partnership case study involving the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.), a large non-profit immigrant services organisation headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Specifically, the study presented here focuses on the organisational practices that are constitutive of frontline workers' engagement with diversity work and learning. It shows that (1) building a diverse and inclusive organisation, (2) supporting continuous learning opportunities at work, and (3) providing diversity training, both directive and generative, form the organisation's diversity "curriculum". This study also demonstrates that the strength of this workplace curriculum is that it has the potential to challenge the boundary between instrumentalism (harnessing diversity work to business success) and equity activism (prioritising diversity work in its own right), and that it creates space for collective reflection in the presence of others. Conceptually drawing on the practice turn in social sciences, particularly Steven Billet and Jennifer Newton's learning practice , and what David Boud terms " the reflective turn", this article positions diversity work as a reflective and iterative process of lifelong learning for both organisations and individual workers.</ab>

        <ab>A review of American history is presented to understand how public policy has contributed to a disproportionate burden of disease in members of underrepresented groups. A review of research conducted in the Stroke Belt provides an opportunity to examine more closely traditional and non-traditional risk factors in an effort to consider strategies for change.</ab>
        <ab>A diverse physician workforce has been offered as a way of improving care for our increasingly diverse populace. Given the expected increased prevalence of stroke in communities of color and the impact of stress from discrimination on health, proactive strategies to promote inclusion and equity to support diversity in perioperative neuroscience is warranted.</ab>
        <ab>Public policy rooted in structural racism has left marginalized groups economically and educationally disadvantaged with less access to health care. Mistrust and fear from ongoing discrimination compels the neuroscience community to broaden their approach for developing a more reassuring and supportive educational environment for patients and trainees.</ab>

        <ab>Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals have higher tobacco use prevalence and consequently higher burden of tobacco-caused diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with their heterosexual or cisgender counterparts. Yet, there is a critical gap in research focused on measuring SGM tobacco-related health disparities and addressing unmet needs of SGM individuals in the context of nicotine and tobacco research.</ab>
        <ab>In this commentary, we summarize recommendations discussed during a pre-conference workshop focused on challenges and opportunities in conducting SGM tobacco control research at the 2019 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Annual Meeting.</ab>
        <ab>Specifically, we recommend defining and measuring SGM identity in all nicotine and tobacco research routinely, using novel methods to engage a demographically diverse sample of the SGM population, and eliciting SGM community voices in tobacco control research.</ab>
        <ab>Addressing these critical research gaps will enable the scientific community to generate the data to fully understand and support SGM individuals in tobacco use prevention and cessation.</ab>
        <ab>Tobacco use and its consequences have become increasingly concentrated in disadvantaged groups, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Through concrete recommendations in this commentary, we aimed to promote health equity, diversity, and inclusion in tobacco research for SGM populations by urging the scientific community to consider expanding efforts to monitor and address tobacco-related health disparities of SGM populations within their respective research programs.</ab>

        <ab>As we strive to lift up a diversity of voices in science, it is important for ecologists, evolutionary scientists, and educators to foster inclusive environments in their research and teaching. Academics in science often lack exposure to research on best practices in diversity, equity, and inclusion and may not know where to start to make scientific environments more welcoming and inclusive. We propose that by approaching research and teaching with empathy, flexibility, and a growth mind-set, scientists can be more supportive and inclusive of their colleagues and students. This paper provides guidance, explores strategies, and directs scientists to resources to better cultivate an inclusive environment in three common settings: the classroom, the research laboratory, and the field. As ecologists and evolutionary scientists, we have an opportunity to adapt our teaching and research practices in order to foster an inclusive educational ecosystem for students and colleagues alike.</ab>

        <ab>In July 2020, the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine opened in Pasadena, California, with an inaugural class of 50 students. The school endeavors to address systemic barriers that have contributed to health care and educational disparities in the United States. To realize its vision for change, equity, inclusion, and diversity (EID) have been woven throughout the school. Board members were chosen in part based on their commitment to the core values of EID. The board developed mission, vision, and values statements that explicitly avow a commitment to EID and recruited a dean (and the dean recruited leaders) who espoused and evinced these values. Leaders, faculty, and staff received training to foster an inclusive environment and ensure accountability. The school developed a curriculum that has been thoroughly evaluated for its representative and inclusive content by a team drawn from all departments. The diverse first class, selected through a holistic admissions approach, has access to student support systems that emphasize an appreciation of the distinct experiences and context of each student. The school plans a rigorous evaluation program to assess its performance in EID. Although the school may well fall short of achieving all of its EID objectives, by learning from its experiences and from evidence of others in academic medicine, the school recognizes its opportunity to continue to come closer to achieving its goals and to help shape and contribute to the national and international discourse on EID.</ab>

        <ab>This article describes priority areas for research on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on older adults that have been identified by the CIHR Institute of Aging (CIHR-IA). The process used by CIHR-IA consists of several iterative phases and thus far has resulted in identification of three key areas for Covid-19 research needs and four cross-cutting thematic areas. The key research priority areas are as follows: response of older adults to disease, vaccination, and therapeutics; mental health and isolation; and supportive care environments. The four cross-cutting themes are equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI); ethical/moral considerations; evidence-informed practices; and digital health technologies. The priorities outlined in this article will inform CIHR-IA's responses to Covid-19 research needs.</ab>

        <ab>Efforts to include people with disability as students and practitioners in the health professions have gained momentum in recent years. However, prevailing technical standards at U.S. medical schools have biases that can prevent or impede their admission, promotion, and graduation. These standards derive from an approach first promulgated in 1979 and have since remained largely unaltered. Current technical standards at most medical schools are now at odds with changes occurring since the 1990 enactment of broad civil rights protections for people with disability and current aspirations for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the medical profession. It is time to replace the technical standards construct with an approach more consistent with current medical practices, and with societal imperatives of equity and social justice. Such an approach should assess candidates' demonstrable skills and merits, rather than relying on a preconceived construct identifying the presence or absence of defined levels of ability. The maturation of competency-based approaches to curricular design and assessment provides an opportunity to reconceptualize the abilities required to practice medicine, foster the appropriate inclusion of physicians with disability, and better align medical education and training with broader societal needs and goals.</ab>

        <ab>Medical schools face growing pressures to produce stronger evidence of their social accountability, but measuring social accountability remains a global challenge. This narrative review aimed to identify and document common themes and indicators across large-scale social accountability frameworks to facilitate development of initial operational constructs to evaluate social accountability in medical education.</ab>
        <ab>The authors searched 5 electronic databases and platforms and the World Wide Web to identify social accountability frameworks applicable to medical education, with a focus on medical schools. English-language, peer-reviewed documents published between 1990 and March 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Primary source social accountability frameworks that represented foundational values, principles, and parameters and were cited in subsequent papers to conceptualize social accountability were included in the analysis. Thematic synthesis was used to describe common elements across included frameworks. Descriptive themes were characterized using the context-input-process-product (CIPP) evaluation model as an organizational framework.</ab>
        <ab>From the initial sample of 33 documents, 4 key social accountability frameworks were selected and analyzed. Six themes (with subthemes) emerged across frameworks, including shared values (core social values of relevance, quality, effectiveness, and equity; professionalism; academic freedom and clinical autonomy) and 5 indicators related to the CIPP model: context (mission statements, community partnerships, active contributions to health care policy); inputs (diversity/equity in recruitment/selection, community population health profiles); processes (curricular activities, community-based clinical training opportunities/learning exposures); products (physician resource planning, quality assurance, program evaluation and accreditation); and impacts (overall improvement in community health outcomes, reduction/prevention of health risks, morbidity/mortality of community diseases).</ab>
        <ab>As more emphasis is placed on social accountability of medical schools, it is imperative to shift focus from educational inputs and processes to educational products and impacts. A way to begin to establish links between inputs, products, and impacts is by using the CIPP evaluation model.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are increasingly highlighted in medical education, but bias continues to disproportionately impact learners from racial and ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in medicine. Many faculty struggle to engage with these concepts in their teaching and fear making mistakes, but few opportunities exist for faculty to develop their skills.</ab>
        <ab>To advance the goal of fostering an equitable educational environment, the authors envisioned a series of faculty development workshops to cultivate faculty skills and comfort with incorporating equity and inclusion in their teaching, assessment, and curriculum development work. The authors conducted a needs assessment and followed Kern's 6-step process for curriculum development to build the workshop series.</ab>
        <ab>Using local resources and expertise, the authors built a workshop series that culminated in a certificate in Teaching for Equity and Inclusion. The development process took 24 months; 22 faculty volunteered to design and teach 7 new workshops. Initial workshop offerings have reached 101 participants, and 120 faculty members have enrolled in the certificate. The workshops have been well received and are rated on par with or more highly than other faculty development offerings at the University of California, San Francisco.</ab>
        <ab>Future directions include assessing the impact of the certificate on participants and workshop faculty, creating opportunities for workshop faculty to share best practices, and exploring alternative models for participation. The authors' experience demonstrates the feasibility of creating a self-sustaining program that will advance faculty competence in the critical areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

It is imperative that we reassess our current recruitment strategies and reimagine our campus and workplace environments to provide an inclusive and equitable culture that is free of institutional barriers, affording equal opportunities for each individual to succeed, thrive, and be their whole self. For too long this vision has been the fight of a heroic few, but it must become the fight of all in order to achieve true change. I am working toward, and look forward to, a future where contributing to diversity, equity, and inclusion is fully integrated into the core mission of our institutions and is an expectation for all of us.</ab>

        <ab>Instructors can deliberately design for equity, diversity, and inclusion, including for large first-year classes, and now instructors have added challenges given COVID-19. Our paper explores the question: How do we integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion and universal design for learning (UDL) into first-year, undergraduate ecology and evolution introductory lessons given the COVID-19 pandemic? Given the large field exploring equity, diversity, and inclusion, we chose to focus on developing reflective practice question rubrics for before, during, and after lessons to encourage UDL for instructors, teaching assistants, and learners. We conducted a focus group within our team and discussed ideas related to online learning, including related pitfalls and solutions. Lastly, we created a figure to illustrate ideas and end with a general discussion. Our reflective practice questions for UDL rubrics, figure, focus group, and discussion aim to increase positive action for equity, diversity, and inclusion in the classroom and beyond.</ab>

        <ab>Background Gender and racial disparities in academic medicine have recently garnered much attention. Implicit Association Tests (IATs) offer a validated means of evaluating unconscious associations and preferences. This study examines the perceived role of implicit bias in faculty development in academic emergency medicine (EM). Methods EM faculty at a large urban academic medical center were invited to independently participate in a self-reflection assessment in preparation for a faculty retreat session discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants completed two IATs designed to examine gender associations (gender IAT) and race preferences (race IAT) followed by a short anonymous survey where IAT scores were recorded. The survey also captured demographic information and perceptions about the impact of gender and racial biases in faculty development. Results Forty faculty members (66%) completed the survey; 70% were male and 80% white. The majority (59%) reported gender IAT results indicating automatic male-sciences and female-liberal arts associations. Nearly half (45%) reported race IAT results indicating an automatic preference for white people. More than 70% of males reported that faculty recruitment, development, and promotion decisions were 'never' or 'seldom' affected by gender bias, while more than 80% reported racial bias 'never' or 'seldom' affects these decisions. Female faculty more frequently perceived adverse effects of unconscious gender and race biases. Conclusion Our group of academic physicians reported IAT results showing different levels of implicit bias compared to the general population. Female faculty may be both more aware of and more susceptible to the adverse effects of unconscious biases. Further study is needed to determine both the extent to which unconscious biases affect the academic workplace, as well as ways in which such unintentional forms of discrimination can be eliminated. Unconscious biases are not unique to EM. Intentional efforts to increase self-awareness of these 'blind spots' may help mitigate their impact and foster a more diverse and inclusive healthcare environment.</ab>

        <ab>Critical research in health professions education makes clear the role of educational institutions in perpetuating problematic discourses related to diversity, as well as their potential role in dismantling and rebuilding those discourses to reflect the realities of power relations that create systemic injustice.</ab>
        <ab>To provide a comprehensive overview of current pedagogical practices and educational paradigms used by occupational therapy educators to teach concepts of, and skills for, equity and diversity.</ab>
        <ab>Seven education and health care databases were searched for articles published between 2007 and 2018.</ab>
        <ab>Consensually developed criteria were refined until an agreement rate of &gt;80% was achieved among the authors. Inclusion criteria focused on entry-level occupational therapy education across the world and explicitly examined approaches to teaching diversity. All articles meeting the criteria were kept for full-text review (N = 87).</ab>
        <ab>Diversity in professional occupational therapy education programs is taught within five main underlying educational paradigms and theories: competency-based (44%), social justice (29%), critical (11%), social accountability (10%), and constructivism (6%). Within these paradigms, 14 key pedagogical practices were applied, with community service learning (37%), international service learning (25%), and didactic or course-based practices (23%) making up the majority of pedagogical practices.</ab>
        <ab>Although current occupational therapy research demonstrates a trend toward critical paradigms and practices, problematic cultural competency theories and uncritical international service learning practices continue to dominate occupational therapy education for diversity. Educators should implement pedagogies and approaches within critical educational paradigms.</ab>
        <ab>This article highlights the importance to occupational therapy education of attending to coherence across educational ethics, paradigms, and learning outcomes in teaching for diversity and health equity.</ab>

        <ab>Social justice, inclusion and equity are everyone's responsibility. We achieve these values when we recognize and accept the characteristics of every person as a unique individual. Professional case managers, or other healthcare practitioners and leaders, have an obligation to advance the health, human and social outcomes of the people they serve, regardless of the social group they belong to and irrespective of their determinants of diversity. It is time to address social justice, inclusion and equity as ethical principles of practice for the professional case manager.</ab>

        <ab>Scientific societies aiming to foster inclusion of scientists from underrepresented (UR) backgrounds among their membership often delegate primary responsibility for this goal to a diversity-focused committee. The National Science Foundation has funded the creation of the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success (ACCESS), a meta-organization bringing together representatives from several such STEM society committees to serve as a hub for a growing community of practice. Our goal is to coordinate efforts to advance inclusive practices by sharing experiences and making synergistic discoveries about what works. ACCESS has analyzed the approaches by which member societies have sought to ensure inclusivity through selection of annual meeting speakers. Here we discuss how inclusive speaker selection fosters better scientific environments for all and identify challenges and promising practices for societies striving to maximize inclusivity of speakers in their scientific programming.</ab>

        <ab>Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women. Policies related to pregnancy and parenting may disproportionately affect the careers of women gynecologists. This article presents peer-reviewed evidence relevant to gender equity in the workplace and suggests proactive interventions to ensure diversity and inclusion for gynecologic surgeons.</ab>

        <ab>As an academic department, we sought to identify effective strategies to engage our faculty and staff in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and programs to build an inclusive department that would address our needs and those of our community and partners. Over a 4-year period, our faculty and staff have participated in town hall meetings, focus group discussions, surveys, and community-building activities to foster stakeholder engagement that will build a leading academic department for the future. We noted that our faculty and staff were committed to building diversity, equity, and inclusion, and our mission and vision were reflective of this. However, communication and transparency may be improved to help support a more inclusive department for all. In the future, we hope to continue with the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion into our department's business processes to achieve meaningful, sustained change and impact through continued focus on recruitment, selection, retention, development, and wellness of faculty and staff-in addition to the continued recruitment of faculty and staff from underrepresented minority groups. Our findings should serve as a call to action for other academic obstetrics and gynecology departments to improve the health and well-being of the individuals we serve.</ab>

        <ab>To explore health disparity in on-campus undergraduate nurse education through the analysis of teaching and teaching material exploring pressure injuries.</ab>
        <ab>As a discipline, nursing espouses ideologies of inclusion, equity and valuing diversity. However, little is known about how these ideologies translate into clinical care. Pressure injury prevention is a routine aspect of nursing care; yet, there is evidence of inequity in relation to clinical care and patient assessment, as people with darker skin tones have a higher prevalence of severe pressure injuries before detection of damage occurs. Despite limited literature being available surrounding the topic of pressure injuries and skin tone diversity, it remains the responsibility of nurse educators to address contemporary issues and health disparity within the nursing curriculum.</ab>
        <ab>A multiple method collective case study. The STROBE checklist was followed in reporting this study.</ab>
        <ab>Documentary and observational data of lectures regarding pressure injuries were collected during 2017 and 2018 from five Higher Education Institutes in England delivering approved nursing undergraduate programmes.</ab>
        <ab>Documentary analysis confirmed all Higher Education Institutes overwhelmingly directed teaching and learning activities about pressure injury towards people with Caucasian skin tones. Observation of teaching indicated all teaching sessions only contained brief, separate and superficial information on people with pressure injuries and darker skin tones. There was no discursive language or awareness of colour or colour blindness.</ab>
        <ab>Radical critique of all teaching and learning activities needs to occur, to help explore, improve and meaningfully and authentically include diversity and inclusivity in nurse education, and in particular, how people across the skin tone spectrum are included and represented in teaching and learning activities.</ab>
        <ab>Critical examination of current teaching practice is crucial to address disparity and ensure care for people with darker skin tones is optimised. Nurse educators have a responsibility to educate for the care needs of all, as the quality of nurse education has a direct impact on care delivery and health disparity. This paper highlights the importance of addressing skin tone diversity and offers the opportunity for reflective practice, not just in formal education, but in clinical settings by preceptors and senior staff.</ab>

        <ab>Migraine and severe headache affect approximately 1 in 6 U.S. adults and migraine is one of the most disabling disorders worldwide. Approximately 903,000 to 1.5 million African American (AA) men are affected by migraine in the United States. Racial disparities in headache medicine exist. In addition, there are limited headache studies that attest to the inclusion of or have robust data on AA men in headache medicine in the United States. Racial concordance between provider and patient may ameliorate some aspects of care disparities. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that diversity and inclusion particularly in leadership of organizations has consistently produced positive change, increased innovation, and long-term success. Most national headache organizations strive to improve the care and lives of people living with headache disorders yet only ~0.5% of their physician members are AA men. Herein, we provide an observation of equity issues from the perspective of AA men in the headache medicine subspecialty. Part 1 of this manuscript explores inherent and potential challenges of the equity of AA men in headache medicine including headache disparities, mistrust, understudied/lack of representation in research, cultural differences, implicit/explicit bias, and the diversity tax. Part 2 of this work offers possible solutions to achieve equity for AA men in headache including: (1) addressing head and facial pain disparities and mistrust in AA men; (2) professionalism and inclusion; (3) organizational/departmental leadership buy-in for racial diversity; (4) implicit/explicit and other bias training; (5) diversity panels with open discussion; (6) addressing diversity tax; (7) senior mentorship; (8) increased opportunities for noteworthy and important roles; (9) forming and building alliances and partnerships; (10) diversity leadership training programs; (11) headache awareness, education, and literacy with focus to underrepresented in medicine trainees and institutions; and (12) focused and supported the recruitment of AA men into headache medicine. More work is needed for equity of AA men in headache medicine.</ab>

        <ab>The Action Collaborative on Neuroscience Training: Developing a Nimble and Versatile Workforce (Action Collaborative) is an ad hoc activity convened under the auspices of the Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders (Neuroscience Forum) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Originated from and informed by the work of the Action Collaborative, the Neuroscience Forum launched a virtual workshop series in order to explore the rapidly evolving neuroscience career landscape and how neuroscience training programs can help trainees to develop the knowledge and skillset needed to advance their careers and biomedical science. The first of these workshops, held on August 20, 2020, tackled complex issues related to racial justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Panel presentations of the workshop were envisioned as a starting point for an ongoing discussion around the ways scientists can stand against racism and support diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuroscience and academia, both in their local communities and in the broader world. This publication highlights the presentations and discussion of the workshop.</ab>

        <ab>We, the Editors of the Journal of the American Heart Association , sincerely regret the publication of the article "Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity: Evolution of Race and Ethnicity Considerations for the Cardiology Workforce in the United States of America From 1969 to 2019". 1 We are aware that the publication of this flawed and biased article has caused a great deal of unnecessary pain and anguish to a number of parties, and reflects extremely poorly on us. We fully support the retraction of this article.</ab>

        <ab>In 2015, the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) created the Mid-Career Leadership Institute. The initial model that motivated the creation of the institute came from my participation in the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program, specifically designed to enhance the leadership skills of senior female faculty in the health sciences. My participation in ELAM was transformative. It led me to run for president of SBM in 2014, to consider how behavioral scientists could similarly benefit from mid-career leadership training, and ultimately to work with the SBM Executive Director, the SBM Leadership Institute Steering Committee, and leadership training professionals to launch the Leadership Institute in 2016. The overarching goal of the SBM Leadership Institute is to train mid-career behavioral scientists engaged in academic and health care settings to develop essential skills needed to navigate the unique challenges of mid-career. Central to this goal is a focus on integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into their emerging leadership roles through participation in training exercises, lectures, and dynamic group discussions. To optimize the Leadership Institute experience, opportunities were developed, including mentoring from SBM seasoned members, peer mentoring through the creation of "learning communities," career coaching, and additional networking opportunities. The purpose of this brief commentary is to summarize lessons learned by highlighting program evaluation, describing key changes over the initial 4 years, and sharing future plans for leadership training.</ab>

        <ab>Professional neuroscience organizations have recently pledged their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in examining institutional discrimination; to raise questions about how to train underrepresented scientists; and to recruit underrepresented subjects for a more equitable scientific enterprise in the 21st century. Studies have illuminated racial disparities in funding, likely because of implicit bias in the review process and differential access to resources. We propose that one concrete way to monitor and redress these disparities is to collect and publicize data on grantees by gender, race, ethnicity, and location from neuroscience funding agencies. Beyond remedying historical disadvantages, disseminating funding more equitably across recipients would be an empirical solution that can improve the very quality of neuroscience.</ab>

        <ab>The positive effects of increased diversity and inclusion in scientific research and practice are well documented. In this issue, DeVilbiss et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(10):998-1010) present findings from a survey used to collect information to characterize diversity among epidemiologists and perceptions of inclusion in the epidemiologic profession. They capture identity across a range of personal characteristics, including race, gender, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, religion, and political leaning. In this commentary, we assert that the inclusion of political leaning as an axis of identity alongside the others undermines the larger project of promoting diversity and inclusion in the profession and is symptomatic of the movement for "ideological diversity" in higher education. We identify why political leaning is not an appropriate metric of diversity and detail why prioritizing ideological diversity counterintuitively can work against equity building initiatives. As an alternative to ideological diversity, we propose that epidemiologists take up an existing framework for research and practice that centers the voices and perspectives of historically marginalized populations in epidemiologic work.</ab>

        <ab>The Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER) has recently taken laudable steps toward increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion within the society, including participation in the annual meeting. In this essay, we argue that there is one critical piece of the diversity and inclusion equation that is, however, overlooked: institution. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, a mere 8 institutions accounted for a disproportionate number of both oral concurrent sessions and symposium speakers. This lack of institutional diversity, unless addressed, will hinder SER's ability to address other aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Across academic medicine, and particularly among faculty and medical school leadership, the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to gender diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Association of American Medical Colleges has launched a bold gender equity initiative, endorsed by its Board of Directors, to implore academic medical institutions to take meaningful and effective actions.Defining what progress should look like to guide these actions is worth deeper exploration. It is not enough to measure the representation of different genders at various levels of leadership within our institutions. Research and experience we share suggests more must be done, especially for women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. What is needed is a fundamental conversation about privilege, intersectionality across different backgrounds, and progress.Institutional leaders have a choice to make. Will we make gender equity a top priority system-wide because we recognize that doing so leads to organizational excellence? Do we understand that establishing a robust, comprehensive definition of gender equity and how it is practiced will result in better outcomes for all? And are we ready and able to prioritize and be accountable for efforts that are measurable, with clear definitions of progress; driven and reinforced by leadership directives; inclusive of all, including men as well as women of diverse backgrounds and orientations; and systemic rather than ad-hoc? Implementing such actions requires initiating difficult conversations, making conscious choices, and modeling best practices from leaders who have successfully made gender equity a priority.</ab>

        <ab>Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.</ab>

        <ab>In nearly all walks of life, leadership sets the tone for what gets done, who does it, and how it is achieved. In 2020, the top ranks of academic medicine have not yet attained gender parity-an aspirational goal set 7 years ago in this journal as "50:50 by 2020," and a vital aim for the United States' productivity and innovation as a leader in biomedical research. Parity in academic leadership for women and other groups underrepresented in science and medicine will seed the culture change necessary for inclusive excellence: environments in which individuals from all backgrounds thrive in their pursuit of new knowledge to benefit human health.In this Invited Commentary, the author describes the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) current system-wide framework and tools for creating cultures of inclusive excellence through a set of guiding principles and integrated strategies. Successful efforts will recognize that individually focused solutions are necessary but not sufficient for institutional culture change. In keeping with a systems approach are implementing accountability and transparency; establishing clear metrics of inclusion, diversity, and equity; tracking and evaluating such metrics; as well as tying these metrics to institutional reward systems. These essential steps to institutional culture transformation require strong partnerships between NIH and the academic community. The author argues that with committed vision, focus, and energy, success is attainable, and soon.</ab>

        <ab>Conferences are important for professional learning and for building academics' reputations and networks. All members of the scientific community should feel supported and free to contribute their best at such events. I evaluated the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation since 2009, to assess whether conferences support participation across sexual orientations and gender identities. Although half of the 30 conferences had codes of conduct promoting equity, diversity and inclusion, the quantity and quality of initiatives to support such principles varied between societies and years. Conferences with codes were significantly more likely to implement structural initiatives to minimize discrimination or harassment, such as procedures for reporting misconduct and submission guidelines to promote speaker diversity, as well as initiatives to support parents. Initiatives minimizing barriers to attendance were rare; 47% of conferences were held in locations that discriminate against certain identities and &lt;10% promoted event safety and accessibility to potential attendees. Piecemeal actions and inadequate conference evaluation have resulted in no significant growth in gender equity or diversity initiatives. I propose a six-step timeline that improves conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.</ab>

        <ab>Otolaryngology has historically lagged behind other specialties with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and remains one of the least diverse specialties as it relates to gender, race and ethnicity. Strategies aimed at increasing DEI include programs designed to provide mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship. Pipeline efforts, inclusivity on committees, bi-directional communication, and equal pay are additional DEI efforts that have been successful in recruiting and retaining those under-represented in medicine (URiM). Closing the equity gap requires commitment; daily action and measuring progress is required. Finally, use feedback to make refinements as opportunities exist to continually improve DEI efforts.</ab>

        <ab>We present interpretations of the idea that "epidemiologists count" in response to the current status of membership and diversity and inclusion efforts within the Society for Epidemiological Research (SER). We review whom epidemiologists count to describe the (mis)representation of SER membership and how categorizations of people reflect social constructions of identity and biases that exist in broader society. We argue that what epidemiologists count-how diversity and inclusion are operationalized-has real-world implications on institutional norms and how inclusive/non-inclusive environments are. Finally, we examine which epidemiologists count within the field and argue that inclusion can only be achieved when we address how resources and opportunities are distributed among epidemiologists. To improve diversity and inclusion within SER and beyond, we recommend that SER strengthen its commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity by: 1) integrating this priority on all agendas; 2) enhancing efforts to improve self-awareness among members and accountability within the organization; 3) supporting the growth of a diversifying workforce in epidemiology; and 4) increasing the visibility of health disparities research and researchers in epidemiology.</ab>

        <ab>Increasing diverse engagement in the Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER) will positively impact the field of epidemiology. As the largest and longest-running epidemiologic society in North America, SER has long been a pioneer in promoting diversity and inclusion. A recent survey of SER members, however, showed there is still room for improving diversity, inclusion, representation, and participation in the Society. In this commentary, as members of both the SER and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Epidemiology's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Anti-Racism, and Science (Epi IDEAS) Working Group, we recommend 4 goals for the SER Annual Meeting and beyond: 1) convene epidemiologic researchers with diverse backgrounds and ideas; 2) promote an inclusive environment at the SER Annual Meeting; 3) develop, compile, and disseminate best practices to honor diversity in epidemiologic research; and 4) increase prioritization of health disparities research and methods. We also suggest strategies for achieving these goals so that SER can better include, support, and elevate members from historically disadvantaged groups. While our recommendations are tailored specifically to SER, the greater epidemiologic and academic communities could benefit from adopting these goals and strategies within their professional societies and conferences.</ab>

        <ab>Recent events encompassing social injustices, healthcare disparities, and police brutality against Black citizens highlight the continued need to strive toward unbiased and inclusive practices in all realms of the world. Our voices as cell biologists are powerful tools that can be used to combat inequities in the scientific landscape. In this inaugural Voices essay, we discuss how exclusion and inclusion events have contributed to our scientific journeys and how scientists can work to create an inclusive environment for our trainees and colleagues. As underrepresented minority scientists in the early and late stages of our scientific training, we frame the trainee experience to provide insight from unique perspectives. This essay also provides actionable items that the cell biology community can implement to promote inclusivity. We anticipate that initiating an open dialogue focused on diversity and inclusion will promote growth in the field of cell biology and enable scientists to assess and assume their role in creating welcoming environments. We believe that scientists at all stages in their careers can make meaningful and habitual contributions to supporting inclusivity in cell biology, thereby creating a future where diversity, equity, and inclusion are expected, not requested.</ab>

        <ab>The fight for social justice and diversity in medicine stems from racial inequalities and discrimination that have permeated our society for centuries. As America has become more diverse in recent years, African American physicians remain largely underrepresented in the healthcare workforce and academic medicine. In the field of infectious diseases, one man, George W. Counts, has shouldered the struggle to end disparities in education, training, research, and academic advancement. This article celebrates his legacy and rekindles the discussion about inclusion, diversity, access, and equity in infectious diseases.</ab>

        <ab>Public health has an equity problem. One of the main pillars of our public health system, schools and academic programs of public health, are under the control of white (heterosexual) faculty. They continue to exclude brown, black, and indigenous people from their faculty and leadership ranks. This racism pervades institutional policies and culture and is a major fault in the quest for health equity. In this essay, I center on the experience of Latinx faculty to examine the roots of this inequity and the arguments for diversity and inclusion. I also propose avenues for change and argue for institutional transformation that goes beyond adding people of color to faculty and leadership roles.</ab>

        <ab>Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and "green infrastructure." Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a "parts store" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.</ab>

        <ab>Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) have increased risk for developing various secondary chronic diseases, especially when they have other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs). Multiple medications are likely prescribed to manage the greater morbidity-related burden for adults with CP; however, because health care delivery and care coordination is suboptimal for this population, adults with CP may have an increased risk for polypharmacy. To date, very little is known about the prescribing practices and extent of polypharmacy for adults with CP.</ab>
        <ab>To determine the prevalence and adjusted odds of polypharmacy among adults with CP only and those with CP+NDDs, compared with adults without CP.</ab>
        <ab>Data from 2017 Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, a U.S. private administrative database, was used for this retrospective cohort study. Diagnosis codes were used to identify adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CP, NDDs (e.g., intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders), and 24 relevant morbidities. Polypharmacy was examined as 0-4 versus ≥ 5, 0-9 versus ≥ 10, and 0-14 versus ≥ 15 medications. Logistic regression estimated the OR and 95% CI of polypharmacy before and after adjusting for age, sex, region of residence, and multimorbidity (as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-5, and ≥ 6 morbidities). Exploratory analyses were conducted to compare polypharmacy among young (18-40 years) and middle-aged (41-64 years) adults with CP only and CP + NDDs with elderly (≥ 65 years) adults without CP.</ab>
        <ab>Adults with CP only (n = 5,603) and CP + NDDs (n = 2,474) had higher unadjusted prevalence and adjusted OR for each polypharmacy definition compared with adults without CP (n = 9.0 million; e.g., ≥ 5 medications: adjusted OR for CP only = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.30-1.47; CP + NDDs: OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 2.20-2.67). Adults with CP+NDDs had higher unadjusted prevalence and adjusted OR of each polypharmacy definition compared with CP only. Compared with elderly without CP, the unadjusted prevalence of polypharmacy was lower for young adults with CP only (e.g., ≥ 5 medications: 60.2%, 43.8%), similar for young adults with CP+NDDs (e.g., ≥ 15 medications: 10.9%, 12.5%), and elevated for middle-aged CP only and CP + NDDs (e.g., ≥ 10 medications: 28.7%, 34.3%, 41.7%).</ab>
        <ab>Privately insured adults with CP only and CP + NDDs have an elevated prevalence of polypharmacy compared with adults without CP, even after accounting for multimorbidity. Importantly, adults aged 18-40 years with CP have a similar (CP + NDDs) prevalence of polypharmacy compared with the general geriatric population, with the prevalence increasing further for CP by middle age.</ab>
        <ab>Whitney was supported by the University of Michigan Office of Health Equity and Inclusion Diversity Fund and the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine. These funding sources had no role in the design or conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

        <ab>A longstanding fact in college sports in the United States (U.S.) is the reality that inequities, inequalities, and discrimination have been major issues preventing institutions from fostering harmonious diversity and inclusion. Several reasons for these persistent outcomes include the prevalence of implicit bias, homologous reproduction, hegemonic, and toxic masculinity/patriarchy, colorblind racism, and abstract liberalism to name a few. In addition, multi-level factors (macro-, meso-, and micro-) also influence the existence and salience of negative organizational cultures and climates particularly for groups that are underrepresented and marginalized in society. Despite the fact several leadership styles have been enacted and numerous policy reforms have been adopted over the years, inequities in representation, occupational mobility, position retention, and quality of experiences persist along racial and gender lines. As a result, the purpose of this manuscript is to offer innovative transformational leadership approaches that incorporate anti-racism, anti-sexism, and culturally responsive stances toward achieving true equity and inclusiveness in sport. Using interdisciplinary theories such as the anti-racism framework and culturally responsive leadership, this manuscript presents a paradigm shift for college sport leadership with the intent of cultivating paramount experiences for people across diverse backgrounds.</ab>

        <ab>It has been documented that there are disparities in who seeks massage therapy in the United States. Yet, there are few conversations about race and ethnicity of the massage therapists who provide these services. We must examine the diversity, equity, and inclusion within the massage therapy profession and consider how the profession can improve the landscape for clients/patients and for those who feel called to work within this field. Although the diversity of the profession and those who seek treatment are rarely discussed, this paper explores these issues and offers possible solutions to expand the diversity of the profession and patient population.</ab>

        <ab>Academic medicine has long faced the challenge of addressing health inequities, reflecting on how these contribute to structural racism, and perpetuating negative social determinants of health. Most recently, we have constructed opportunities for dialogues about racism, discrimination, and microaggressions (RDM). As such, we created a professional development program that encouraged participants to (1) openly discuss RDM and the impact they have in academia, (2) learn about tools to address and respond to RDM, and (3) move towards the creation of inclusive environments. The target audience included institutional leaders, faculty, trainees, professional staff, and health care teams.</ab>
        <ab>We sought to meet workshop goals by integrating anti-racist dramaturgical teaching, introducing concepts knowledge, and practicing communication tools. To assess learning and evaluate our workshops, participants completed a pre- and postsurvey.</ab>
        <ab>Results showed that 30 participants were more comfortable with discussing issues related to race/ethnicity, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, and spirituality after participating in the workshops. Prior to the two workshops, the percentage of learners who felt confident initiating conversations ranged from 29% to 54%. After the workshops, the percentage of learners who felt confident ranged from 58% to 92%. The greatest increase, 100%, was observed in the levels of confidence in initiating conversations related to race/ethnicity.</ab>
        <ab>Despite medical education's commitment to cultural competence and institutional mission statements that value diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, professional development opportunities are limited. Participants strongly agreed their participation in such a workshop was relevant and important to their professional work.</ab>

        <ab>National medical specialty societies speak for their respective fields in policy debates, influence research, affect trainees' specialization decisions, provide career development opportunities, and confer awards and recognitions. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the gender demographics of society members and leaders.</ab>
        <ab>In 2016, the Group on Women in Medicine and Science (of the Association of American Medical Colleges) sought to characterize the gender of members and leaders of specialty societies from 2000 to 2015. This report provides descriptive data, including how many of the responding societies (representing each of 30 major medical specialties) had substantial (&gt; 10%) increases in women's representation among leadership between the first and second halves of the study period.</ab>
        <ab>The average proportion of full members who were female in responding societies was 25.4% in 2005 and 29.3% in 2015. The proportion of women among those serving as the highest-ranking elected leader between 2000 and 2015 in each specialty ranged from 0% to 37.5% (mean, 15.8%). The mean proportion of women on governing boards ranged from 0% to 37.3% (mean of means, 18.8%) in 2000-2007 and from 0% to 47.6% (mean of means, 25.2%) in 2008-2015. In 9 specialties, the mean percentage of women serving on governing boards increased by over 10% from the first to the second half of the study period.</ab>
        <ab>Although many women are full members of specialty societies, women still constitute a minority of leaders. This report establishes a baseline from which to evaluate the effect of societies' efforts to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>For decades, nursing programs have worked to address the need for a culturally diverse workforce and student body to better reflect the populations they serve. The development of a diversity and inclusivity statement is a first step in ameliorating this issue.</ab>
        <ab>A clearly communicated diversity and inclusivity statement should demonstrate a nursing organization's commitment to the value of people from all backgrounds. It should include language that emphasizes the value of diverse cultures, experiences, thoughts, and contributions.</ab>
        <ab>Nursing faculty can benefit from an organized and literature-supported model for writing meaningful diversity and inclusivity statements.</ab>
        <ab>Such an approach will communicate a nursing program's commitment to diversity and inclusion in the organization's mission, policies, practices, relationships, and curricula. This article provides nursing faculty with evidence-supported guidelines for writing meaningful diversity, inclusion, and equity statements for their nursing programs.</ab>

        <ab>Although there are considerable racial and ethnic disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the United States and globally, clinical trials often do not reflect disease incidence across racial and ethnic subgroups. This study aims to comprehensively review the reporting of race and ethnicity data and the representation of race and ethnicity across prostate cancer treatment-, prevention-, and screening-based clinical trials.</ab>
        <ab>Seventy-two global phase III and IV prevention, screening, and treatment prostate cancer clinical trials with enrollment start dates between 1987 and 2016 were analyzed in this study, representing a total of 893,378 individual trial participants. Availability and representation of race and ethnicity data by trial funding type, temporal changes in the racial/ethnic diversity of participants, and geographic representation of countries were assessed.</ab>
        <ab>Of the 72 trials analyzed, 59 (81.9%) had available race data, and 11 (15.3%) of these trials additionally reported ethnicity. Of the trials reporting data, participants were overwhelmingly white men (with the highest proportion in U.S. nonpublicly funded trials), comprising over 96% of the study population. The proportion of white participants in prostate cancer clinical trials has remained at over 80% since 1990. Geographically, Africa and the Caribbean were particularly underrepresented with only 3% of countries included.</ab>
        <ab>Trial participants continue to be majority white despite the known racial disparities in prostate cancer clinical outcomes.</ab>
        <ab>Current and future trials must use novel recruitment strategies to ensure enrollment of underrepresented men. Targeting the inclusion of African and Caribbean medical centers is crucial to achieve equity in representation.</ab>

        <ab>Background The issue of gender disparity is particularly important in the domain of public health where the tone of its leadership is pivotal in bringing about impactful change to research, policies, and the wellbeing of our various populations. Our aim is to explore the gender disparity of author metrics and academic rankings of public health physician faculty through a cross-sectional study. Methods Data collection for this retrospective cross-sectional study took place during June and July of 2017. Public health and preventive medicine residency training programs in the United States and Canada were to compiled and all faculty members that met the inclusion criteria were recorded (n = 973). Variables of interest include gender, h-index, years of active research, and academic appointments. SCOPUS database (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was used to generate author metrics, and all statistical tests were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Overall, 31.14% (n = 303) of faculty members we studied were from Canada, and 68.86% (n = 670) were from the United States. In both countries, males made up the majority of all faculty members. Female faculty comprised most of the early career positions, and their proportions tapered off with higher academic rank, whereas male faculty trended in the opposite direction. Males generally were higher in all academic measures across all appointments.  Conclusions  Gender disparity exists within the North American public health and preventive medicine discipline. There are underlying factors preventing women from moving beyond early career positions or engaging in academic research.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity-focused committees continue to play essential roles in the efforts of professional scientific societies to foster inclusion and facilitate the professional development of underrepresented minority (URM) young scientists in their respective scientific disciplines. Until recently, the efforts of these committees have remained independent and disconnected from one another. Funding from the National Science Foundation has allowed several of these committees to come together and form the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success, herein referred to as ACCESS. The overall goal of this meta-organization is to create a community in which diversity-focused committees can interact, synergize, share their collective experiences, and have a unified voice on behalf of URM trainees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. In this Essay , we compare and contrast the broad approaches that scientific societies in ACCESS use to implement and assess their travel award programs for URM trainees. We also report a set of recommendations, including both short- and long-term outcomes assessment in populations of interest and specialized programmatic activities coupled to travel award programs.</ab>

        <ab>Health disparities persist despite ongoing efforts. Given the United States' rapidly changing demography and socio-cultural diversity, a paradigm shift in behavioral medicine is needed to advance research and interventions focused on health equity. This paper introduces the ConNECT Framework as a model to link the sciences of behavioral medicine and health equity with the goal of achieving equitable health and outcomes in the twenty-first century. We first evaluate the state of health equity efforts in behavioral medicine science and identify key opportunities to advance the field. We then discuss and present actionable recommendations related to ConNECT's five broad and synergistic principles: (1) Integrating Context; (2) Fostering a Norm of Inclusion; (3) Ensuring Equitable Diffusion of Innovations; (4) Harnessing Communication Technology; and (5) Prioritizing Specialized Training. The framework holds significant promise for furthering health equity and ushering in a new and refreshing era of behavioral medicine science and practice.</ab>

        <ab>Diversifying the radiation oncology workforce is an urgent and unmet need. During the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2019 Annual Meeting, ASTRO's Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (CHEDI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collaborated on the ASTRO-NCI Diversity Symposium, entitled "Pathways for Recruiting and Retaining Women and Underrepresented Minority Clinicians and Physician Scientists Into the Radiation Oncology Workforce." Herein, we summarize the presented data and personal anecdotes with the goal of raising awareness of ongoing and future initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of underrepesented groups to radiation oncology. Common themes include the pivotal role of mentorship and standardized institutional practices - such as protected time and pay parity - as critical to achieving a more diverse and inclusive workplace.</ab>

        <ab>There is plenty of evidence to support that women leaders are needed in the health and pharmaceutical sectors, although most of the leadership positions in global health are predominantly occupied by men. This is a major challenge to global health policy. Gender diversity and inclusion within the pharmaceutical workforce is integral to optimal patient care. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior and leadership positions within pharmacy, despite outnumbering the men in the global pharmacy workforce. This commentary highlights the need towards gender equity and discusses the several key initiatives that are building momentum and making substantial progress towards this agenda in the pharmaceutical workforce.</ab>

        <ab>Previous studies have shown that medical student mistreatment is common. However, few data exist to date describing how the prevalence of medical student mistreatment varies by student sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.</ab>
        <ab>To examine the association between mistreatment and medical student sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.</ab>
        <ab>This cohort study analyzed data from the 2016 and 2017 Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire. The questionnaire annually surveys graduating students at all 140 accredited allopathic US medical schools. Participants were graduates from allopathic US medical schools in 2016 and 2017. Data were analyzed between April 1 and December 31, 2019.</ab>
        <ab>Prevalence of self-reported medical student mistreatment by sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 27 504 unique student surveys were analyzed, representing 72.1% of graduating US medical students in 2016 and 2017. The sample included the following: 13 351 female respondents (48.5%), 16 521 white (60.1%), 5641 Asian (20.5%), 2433 underrepresented minority (URM) (8.8%), and 2376 multiracial respondents (8.6%); and 25 763 heterosexual (93.7%) and 1463 lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) respondents (5.3%). At least 1 episode of mistreatment was reported by a greater proportion of female students compared with male students (40.9% vs 25.2%, P &lt; .001); Asian, URM, and multiracial students compared with white students (31.9%, 38.0%, 32.9%, and 24.0%, respectively; P &lt; .001); and LGB students compared with heterosexual students (43.5% vs 23.6%, P &lt; .001). A higher percentage of female students compared with male students reported discrimination based on gender (28.2% vs 9.4%, P &lt; .001); a greater proportion of Asian, URM, and multiracial students compared with white students reported discrimination based on race/ethnicity (15.7%, 23.3%, 11.8%, and 3.8%, respectively; P &lt; .001), and LGB students reported a higher prevalence of discrimination based on sexual orientation than heterosexual students (23.1% vs 1.0%, P &lt; .001). Moreover, higher proportions of female (17.8% vs 7.0%), URM, Asian, and multiracial (4.9% white, 10.7% Asian, 16.3% URM, and 11.3% multiracial), and LGB (16.4% vs 3.6%) students reported 2 or more types of mistreatment compared with their male, white, and heterosexual counterparts (P &lt; .001).</ab>
        <ab>Female, URM, Asian, multiracial, and LGB students seem to bear a disproportionate burden of the mistreatment reported in medical schools. It appears that addressing the disparate mistreatment reported will be an important step to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in medical education.</ab>

        <ab>The American Surgical Association delineated deficiencies of diversity, equity, and inclusion within academic surgery. Opportunities to increase diversity are membership in surgical societies and leadership development. We hypothesized that surgical society meetings represent additional opportunities, using gender diversity as an example.</ab>
        <ab>Published programs from annual meetings of three large surgical societies were reviewed. Participants' gender was classified by first name. Online search was used for equivocal names. We used JMP Pro 14.1.0 for univariate and multivariate logistic regression.</ab>
        <ab>During six meetings (2016-2018), 415 sessions with 4078 participants were included, 61% educational panels with invited faculty and 39% abstract sessions. Across all meetings, 32% of abstracts were presented by women, 22% of panel chairs or invited faculty were women. Fifty-four percent of male meeting participants were invited by their societies as moderator or speaker, and 41% of female participants were invited faculty. Fifty-nine percent of all panel chairs had no woman participant. In both univariate and multivariate regression, women had more than threefold the odds of presenting an abstract than presenting on a panel (p &lt; 0.0001). Women were three times more likely to present in a session that was co-chaired by a woman (&lt; 0.0001).</ab>
        <ab>One in three abstract presenters in national surgery meetings was a woman, demonstrating engagement in the societies. Historically, men are more likely invited as faculty than women. The presence of a woman co-chair on a panel correlated with increased female participation. Similar scenarios may apply to other underrepresented groups.</ab>

        <ab>Membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AΩA) is a widely recognized achievement valued by residency selection committees and employers. Yet research has shown selection favors students from racial/ethnic groups not underrepresented in medicine (not-UIM). The authors describe efforts to create equity in AΩA selection at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, through implementation of a holistic selection process, starting with the class of 2017, and present outcomes.Informed by the definition of holistic review, medical school leaders applied strategic changes grounded in evidence on inclusion, mitigating bias, and increasing opportunity throughout the AΩA selection process. These addressed increasing selection committee diversity, revising selection criteria and training committee members to review applications using a new instrument, broadening student eligibility and inviting applications, reviewing blinded applications, and making final selection decisions based on review and discussion of a rank-ordered list of students that equally weighted academic achievement and professional contributions.The authors compared AΩA eligibility and selection outcomes for 3 classes (2014-2016) during clerkship metric-driven selection, which prioritized academic achievement, and 3 classes (2017-2019) during holistic selection. During clerkship metric-driven selection, not-UIM students were 4 times more likely than UIM students to be eligible for AΩA (P = .001) and 3 times more likely to be selected (P = .001). During holistic selection, not-UIM students were 2 times more likely than UIM students to be eligible for AΩA (P = .001); not-UIM and UIM students were similarly likely to be selected (odds ratio = .7, P = .12)This new holistic selection process created equity in representation of UIM students among students selected for AΩA. Centered on equity pedagogy, which advocates dismantling structures that create inequity, this holistic selection process has implications for creating equity in awards selection during medical education.</ab>

        <ab>With a motto of "Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering," Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AΩA) supports the importance, inclusion, and development of a culturally and ethnically diverse medical profession with equitable access for all. The underrepresentation of minorities in medical schools and medicine continues to be a challenge for the medical profession, medical education, and AΩA. AΩA has worked, and continues to work, to ensure the development of diverse leaders, fostering within them the objectivity and equity to be inclusive servant leaders who understand and embrace diversity in all its forms.Inclusion of talented individuals from different backgrounds benefits patient care, population health, education, and scientific discovery. AΩA values an inclusive, diverse, fair, and equitable work and learning environment for all and supports the medical profession in its work to achieve a welcoming, inclusive environment in teaching, learning, caring for patients, and collaboration.The diversity of medical schools is changing and will continue to change. AΩA is committed to continuing to work with its members, medical school deans, and AΩA chapters to assure that AΩA elections are unbiased and based on the values of AΩA and the profession of medicine in service to patients and the profession.Progress toward diversity, inclusion, and equity is more than simply checking off a box or responding to criticism-it is about being and developing diverse excellent physicians. AΩA and all those in the medical profession must continue to guide medicine to be unbiased, open, accepting, inclusive, and culturally aware in order to "Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering."</ab>

        <ab>The need for e-mental health (electronic mental health) services in Canada is significant. The current mental health care delivery models primarily require people to access services in person with a health professional. Given the large number of people requiring mental health care in Canada, this model of care delivery is not sufficient in its current form. E-mental health technologies may offer an important solution to the problem. This topic was discussed in greater depth at the 9th Annual Canadian E-Mental Health Conference held in Toronto, Canada. Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include (1) the importance of trust, transparency, human centeredness, and compassion in the development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; (2) an emphasis on equity, diversity, inclusion, and access when implementing e-mental health services; (3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to engage in a digital way of working; and (4) co-production of e-mental health services among a diverse stakeholder group becoming the standard way of working.</ab>

        <ab>In its December 2019 edition, the Notices of the American Mathematical Society published an essay critical of the use of diversity statements in academic hiring. The publication of this essay prompted many responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather, asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically against diversity statements, calling them "a mistake," and claiming that their usage during early stages of faculty hiring "diminishes mathematical achievement." Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities. Our empirical results are consistent with theories of power drawn from the social sciences.</ab>
        <ab>I have read the journal’s policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: CMT and JAH are co-founders of the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity, Inc. (QSIDE). One of the public letters (\Letter B") whose signatories we study in this paper was written in rebuttal to an online blog post made by CMT through QSIDE. Additionally, CMT, CDE, KI, BK, DL, and JL are drafters of and signatories to one of the public letters (\Letter A") and hence they appear in the data set we construct and study. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</ab>

        <ab>Since 1969, racial and ethnic preferences have existed throughout the American medical academy. The primary purpose has been to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics within the physician workforce as they were deemed to be "underrepresented in medicine." To this day, the goal continues to be population parity or proportional representation. These affirmative action programs were traditionally voluntary, created and implemented at the state or institutional level, limited to the premedical and medical school stages, and intended to be temporary. Despite these efforts, numerical targets for underrepresented minorities set by the Association of American Medical Colleges have consistently fallen short. Failures have largely been attributable to the limited qualified applicant pool and legal challenges to the use of race and ethnicity in admissions to institutions of higher education. In response, programs under the appellation of diversity, inclusion, and equity have recently been created to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics as medical school students, internal medicine trainees, cardiovascular disease trainees, and cardiovascular disease faculty. These new diversity programs are mandatory, created and implemented at the national level, imposed throughout all stages of academic medicine and cardiology, and intended to be permanent. The purpose of this white paper is to provide an overview of policies that have been created to impact the racial and ethnic composition of the cardiology workforce, to consider the evolution of racial and ethnic preferences in legal and medical spheres, to critically assess current paradigms, and to consider potential solutions to anticipated challenges.</ab>

        <ab>The size and reach of the genetic counseling profession have expanded on a global scale since the 1970s. Despite this growth, the profession of genetic counseling has remained demographically homogenous. Promoting a culture of inclusivity that supports visible and invisible diversity and leveraging that culture not only expands perspectives represented in the field, but also helps foster equity in genetic services. This report summarizes the formation, implementation, and outcomes of the 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Task Force (TF) of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), including the group's responses to their allotted charges from the NSGC Board of Directors. The recommendations generated by the TF aim to aid in the (1) establishment of infrastructure for ongoing diversity, inclusion, and equity (DEI) work by collaborating with a DEI organizational expert and forming a DEI advisory group within the NSGC, (2) development of specific short-term DEI initiatives, and (3) identification of seven areas of focus areas that must be addressed in order to create meaningful and measurable DEI improvements. The efficacy of these recommendations will depend on the consistency and creativity of implementation, shared responsibility, sufficient resources allocated to DEI initiatives, and measurable outcomes.</ab>

        <ab>Like its peer health professions, the genetic counseling field recognizes the need for and value of diversity, inclusion, cultural competency, and equity (DICE). However, despite decades of diversity initiatives, minimal gains in the percentage of genetic counselors with minority identities have been realized. In order to gather information about DICE efforts, two surveys were created and distributed to genetic service providers, trainees, and genetic counseling program faculty yielding a total of 76 responses. Additionally, a literature scan was performed to gain an understanding of past and ongoing DICE efforts in the career. Three emerging domains resulted from quantitative and qualitative analysis of the submitted data: (1) Categories of DICE Projects, (2) Parties Carrying Out DICE Projects, and (3) What is Missing? Overall, inclusion efforts are notably underrepresented among DICE projects. Also, DICE efforts are generally under-supported, unfunded, and under-recognized as work-related responsibilities. To enhance DICE within the genetic counseling profession, we recommend developing additional research and projects focused on career inclusion and equity, implementing policies requiring DICE training for leaders within the field, encouraging project evaluation and outcomes dissemination, and creating a well-maintained web-based centralized repository for DICE resources.</ab>

        <ab>An emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion is growing within the field of education, including health professions education. In particular, no published literature exists regarding decolonizing and Indigenizing pharmacy education. Post-secondary pharmacy programs in Canada have a unique opportunity to learn from the decolonizing and Indigenizing practices observed in the educational programs of other health professions and post-secondary institutions and become international leaders in this area.</ab>
        <ab>Literature searches on PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC (Ovid), iPortal, and PsycINFO were performed, revealing zero articles on decolonizing and/or Indigenizing pharmacy education. Search terms were expanded to include all health professions education programs with published literature on decolonizing and Indigenizing practices. All publications that included either or both terms (decolonizing and/or Indigenizing) and within any realm of health professions education (e.g., curriculum, assessment, evaluation, instructional design) were reviewed.</ab>
        <ab>Literature on decolonizing and Indigenizing health professions education in health disciplines, such as nursing and speech pathology, were reviewed. In conjunction with literature on decolonization and Indigenization of education, with a focus on post-secondary institutions, a number of strategies are proposed to decolonize and Indigenize pharmacy education.</ab>
        <ab>Findings from this review will better inform post-secondary pharmacy education programs to engage in decolonization and Indigenization practices. Engaging in decolonization and Indigenization of pharmacy education is expected to not only improve the educational experience of Indigenous students in pharmacy programs, but also improve the care received by Indigenous patients from all graduates of pharmacy.</ab>

        <ab>Several lawsuits have recently been filed against U.S. universities; the plaintiffs contend that considerations of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions discriminate against Asian Americans. In prior cases brought by non-Latino whites, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these considerations, arguing that they are crucial to a compelling interest to increase diversity. The dissenting opinion, however, concerns the possibility that such policies disadvantage Asian Americans, who are considered overrepresented in higher education. Here, the authors explain how a decision favoring the plaintiffs would affect U.S. medical schools. First, eliminating race and ethnicity in holistic review would undermine efforts to diversify the physician workforce. Second, the restrictions on considering race/ethnicity in admissions decisions would not remedy potential discrimination against Asian Americans that arise from implicit biases. Third, such restrictions would exacerbate the difficulty of addressing the diversity of experiences within Asian American subgroups, including recognizing those who are underrepresented in medicine. The authors propose that medical schools engage Asian Americans in diversity and inclusion efforts and recommend the following strategies: incorporate health equity into the institutional mission and admissions policies, disaggregate data to identify underrepresented Asian subgroups, include Asian Americans in diversity committees and support faculty who make diversity work part of their academic portfolio, and enhance the Asian American faculty pipeline through support and mentorship of students. Asian Americans will soon comprise one-fifth of the U.S. physician workforce and should be welcomed as part of the solution to advancing diversity and inclusion in medicine, not cast as the problem.</ab>

        <ab>The health and aged care workforce must understand and support the diverse needs of older people to enhance their care experience. We previously identified five principles of diversity training for this workforce: awareness of unconscious bias and prejudice; promotion of inclusion; access and equity; appropriate engagement; and intersectionality. This study aims to explore how these principles are considered from the perspectives of older Australians.</ab>
        <ab>Older people (≥65 years) receiving home care and nursing services based in Victoria, Australia were invited to participate in a home-based semi-structured interview about their experience of, or with, diversity. Interviews were thematically analysed using a priori categories based on our previous work on principles of diversity training, and themes were interpreted and expanded upon based on the participants' experiences and understanding of diversity concepts and their care needs.</ab>
        <ab>Fifteen older people (seven female, eight male), mean age 76 years (range 71-85 years), were interviewed. Five themes were drawn from the data. It was found that human connection through building (1) trust and rapport was highly valued as an approach by older people, crucial as a first step to understanding what is important to the older person. Identifying with (2) intersectionality, that is, the different intersecting aspects of who they are and their experiences was understood by the participants as an important framework to meet their needs. The participants were aware of (3) unconscious bias and prejudice by health professionals and its impact on their care. Participants also noted that (4) promotion of inclusion through language was important to for a positive relationship with the healthcare worker. The participants understood that to facilitate human connection, these four principles of human interaction were critical, underpinned by (5) access and equity of the system. A model articulating these relationships was developed.</ab>
        <ab>Health and aged care training should incorporate the five diversity principles to support older people to participate in their own care.</ab>

        <ab>Rambo, Adele, and a religion professor walk into a coffee shop. What in the world do they have in common? This essay integrates Lewis Rambo's scholarship on conversion with pop singer Adele's popular song "Send My Love to Your Lover" to understand and redress inequity in individual risk within processes of institutional conversion. The author focuses on practices of inclusion in institutions of higher education using the specific example of theological schools with aspirational school mission statements that embrace equity and diversities. She argues that bringing Rambo and Adele into conversation with anecdotal and published research on institutional (in)justice illuminates four practices that institutions could adopt to better align practice with promise and thereby promote wellness for all who are impacted by institutional health.</ab>

        <ab>The benefits of a diverse workforce in medicine have been previously described. While the population of the United States has become increasingly diverse, this has not occurred in the physician workforce. In academic medicine, underrepresented in medicine (URiM) faculty are less likely to be promoted or retained in academic institutions. Studies suggest that mentorship and engagement increase the likelihood of development, retention, and promotion. However, it is not clear what form of mentorship creates these changes. The Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine (ADIEM), an academy within the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, is a group focused on advancing diversity and inclusion as well as promoting the development of its URiM students, residents, and faculty. The Academy serves many of the functions of a mentoring program. We assessed whether active involvement in ADIEM led to increased publications, promotion, or leadership advancement in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>We performed a survey of ADIEM members to determine if career development and productivity, defined as written scholarly products, presentations, and mentorship in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion was enhanced by the establishment of the academy. To determine whether there were significant changes in academic accomplishments after the formation of ADIEM, two groups, ADIEM leaders and ADIEM nonleader members, were examined.</ab>
        <ab>Thirteen ADIEM leaders and 14 ADIEM nonleader members completed the survey. Academic productivity in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion increased significantly among ADIEM leaders when compared to ADIEM nonleader members after the founding of ADIEM. In particular, in the ADIEM leader group, there were significant increases in manuscript publications (1.31 ± 1.6 to 5.5 ± 7.96, p = 0.12), didactic presentations (3.85 ± 7.36 to 23.46 ± 44.52, p &lt; 0.01), grand rounds presentations (0.83 ± 1.75 to 8.6 ± 10.71, p &lt; 0.05), and student/resident mentees (6.46 ± 9.36 to 25 ± 30.41, p = 0.02).</ab>
        <ab>The formation of a specialized academy within a national medical society has advanced academic accomplishments in diversity, equity, and inclusion in emergency medicine among ADIEM leadership. Involvement of URiM and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender faculty in the academy fostered faculty development, mentoring, and educational scholarship.</ab>

        <ab>This commentary integrates and expands on the preceding articles in this issue that document and celebrate a century of women's achievements in the International Association for Dental Research (IADR). The increasing participation and leadership of women in dental and craniofacial research and within the IADR were viewed from the perspective of a changing culture of science. The steps that have been taken by the IADR to develop greater inclusiveness are acknowledged, and some of the challenges that remain are discussed in terms of obstacles that are most often social or cultural in origin. Comparisons are made across countries, and the social determinants that lead to differences in women's participation are described. Recommendations are made for developing strategies to change elements of our institutional cultures that have provided advantages to some groups of researchers more than to others. The unconscious biases and a lack of commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion that limit the participation of members of some groups limit the progress and achievements of science in general.</ab>

        <ab>The aim of this review is to investigate the growth of diversity and inclusion in global academic dental research with a focus on gender equality. A diverse range of research methodologies were used to conduct this review, including an extensive review of the literature, engagement of key informants in dental academic leadership positions around the world, and review of current data from a variety of national and international organizations. Results provide evidence of gender inequalities that currently persist in dental academics and research. Although the gender gap among graduating dental students in North America and the two most populous countries in Europe (the United Kingdom and France) has been narrowed, women make up 30% to 40% of registered dentists in countries throughout Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. In academic dentistry around the globe, greater gender inequality was found to correlate with higher ranking academic and leadership positions in the United States, United Kingdom, several countries in European Union, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. Further disparities are noted in the dental research sector, where women make up 33% of dental researchers in the European Union, 35% in North America, 55% in Brazil, and 25% in Japan. Family and societal pressures, limited access to research funding, and lack of mentoring and leadership training opportunities are reported as also contributing to gender inequalities. To continue advancing gender equality in dental academia and research, efforts should be geared toward the collection and public dissemination of data on gender-specific distributions. Such evidence-driven information will guide the selection of future strategies and best practices for promoting gender equity in the dental workforce, which provides a major pipeline of researchers and scholars for the dental profession.</ab>

        <ab>Diversity initiatives are being implemented widely within academia and society more broadly; however, the School of Nursing (SoN) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, is taking an innovative approach. Faculty members recognized the need to support students at the graduate and undergraduate levels from Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Two-Spirit), and International communities in a student-led initiative with the mission to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity within the SoN. This coalition seeks to offer students who are often rendered invisible within the academy and society more broadly in relation to dominant cultures and normative expectations an opportunity to build relationships and expose shared histories of oppression in such a way that issues of social justice are uncovered. In response to nursing students and faculty who self-identify as members of dominant groups and who sought inclusion as allies, the leaders of the student community groups recognized a need to develop a position statement on allyship. The collaboration that transpired between the four groups of communities to develop the position statement led to the formation of the Student Equity Coalition. This article begins with the authors' definition of allyship, followed by a description of the context in which this unique initiative is taking place, the rationale behind developing a shared position statement on allyship, and the significance of this work in positioning and supporting nursing students of minority status as emerging nurse leaders.</ab>

        <ab>Gender bias and discrimination have profound and far-reaching effects on the health care workforce, delivery of patient care, and advancement of science and are antithetical to the principles of professionalism. In the quest for gender equity, medicine, with its abundance of highly educated and qualified women, should be leading the way. The sheer number of women who comprise the majority of pediatricians in the United States suggests this specialty has a unique opportunity to stand out as progressively equitable. Indeed, there has been much progress to celebrate for women in medicine and pediatrics. However, many challenges remain, and there are areas in which progress is too slow, stalled, or even regressing. The fair treatment of women pediatricians will require enhanced and simultaneous commitment from leaders in 4 key gatekeeper groups: academic medical centers, hospitals, health care organizations, and practices; medical societies; journals; and funding agencies. In this report, we describe the 6-step equity, diversity, and inclusion cycle, which provides a strategic methodology to (1) examine equity, diversity, and inclusion data; (2) share results with stakeholders; (3) investigate causality; (4) implement strategic interventions; (5) track outcomes and adjust strategies; and (6) disseminate results. Next steps include the enforcement of a climate of transparency and accountability, with leaders prioritizing and financially supporting workforce gender equity. This scientific and data-driven approach will accelerate progress and help pave a pathway to better health care and science.</ab>

        <ab>Student populations in the United States are increasingly diverse, prompting the need to make learning environments in schools of nursing more inclusive. Training for faculty is needed to support this work; however, evidence regarding best practices to make classrooms more inclusive is lacking.</ab>
        <ab>A 3-day Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Institute was developed and conducted to create inclusive learning environments; facilitate crucial conversations on racism and other -isms, especially in the context of nursing and health equity; and practice these skills and develop or transform at least one actual class activity.</ab>
        <ab>DEI Institute satisfaction and impact were overwhelmingly positive, and statistically significant increases in DEI-related teaching self-efficacy were observed post-Institute (p values ranging from .0004 to &lt; .0001).</ab>
        <ab>The DEI Institute is one example of a successful approach that can create inclusive learning environments and address issues related to health equity. [J Nurs Educ. 2019;58(11):633-640.].</ab>

        <ab>Gender disparity has been documented in advanced doctoral degrees, research, and academic positions, and therefore, it can logically be deduced that the gender disparity would be found in journals' editorial boards. In this study, we sought to determine the gender distribution in editorial boards of psychiatry journals worldwide. We also studied the academic achievements of editorial board members by comparing professional background, education level, and research productivity indices. We analyzed the gender of editorial members of 119 psychiatry journals from Clarivate Analytics' Journal Citation Reports. Our data included 8423 editorial board members from which we randomly selected 10% editorial board members to represent the full sample for further analyses. Overall, women represented 30.4% of editorial board and approximately 30% in each category: (1) Editor-in-chief/deputies, (2) Associate/section editors, (3) Editorial board*, and (4) Advisory board. The majority (65%) of men were M.D. psychiatrists, and women (58%) were Ph.D. psychologists. Women in editorial leadership positions (Category 1 &amp; 2) were correlated with fewer women in editorial or advisory boards. Women had half the mean number of publications than men while serving journals with approximately the same mean impact factor. Our study results show that, besides gender disparity, gender bias does not exist in the psychiatry journal editorial boards. Given the implication of the editorial board position on science, academic advancement, and networking, this disparity remains detrimental to achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic psychiatry.</ab>

        <ab>With 3.8% black trainees in 2012, pathology had significantly fewer trainees from groups underrepresented in medicine compared to other specialties. To address this, faculty in the Johns Hopkins Department of Pathology established an outreach program and funded rotation for students underrepresented in medicine and from disadvantaged groups. The aims were to increase exposure to the field and improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in pathology. A 1-month rotation for students underrepresented in medicine was established in 2013. Rotation schedules tailored to each rotator's interests included resident conferences and individual faculty meetings. In 2016, a proactive outreach program was established. Faculty visited historically black medical schools and underrepresented in medicine student groups at other institutions, where they gave a "Careers in Pathology" presentation targeted to second- and third-year medical students. Faculty also attended underrepresented in medicine student conferences and participated in high school student programs to further expand the underrepresented in medicine pipeline into medicine and pathology. Since 2016, fourteen outreach presentations have been delivered. The number of rotators increased from 1 in 2013 to 18 in July 2019. Rotators self-identified as African, African American, Hispanic, and Native American. Most were second- to fourth-year medical students, and 1 was a pathology resident. Six rotators are currently pathology residents, and others are strongly considering applying to pathology. The outreach efforts account for the success of our rotation, which, in turn, has had a positive impact on interest in pathology. However, we recognize barriers to retention and intend to incorporate additional professional development activities to further address equity.</ab>

        <ab>The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has grown and evolved considerably since its foundation in 1963 as an academic professional society. It currently has &gt;11 000 members, both domestic and international, drawn from the breadth of infectious diseases practice, from basic research to public health. Governance of the Society has not evolved as rapidly, and, in the last few years, it was increasingly evident to many members that the IDSA leadership was less representative of the membership than it ought to be. As a result of a rigorous review of its governance structure, the Society has committed to a policy of inclusion, diversity, access, and equity. It has also reformed the methods by which future IDSA leaders are identified and given roles. These changes should increase the opportunities for all members of the Society to participate in its volunteer leadership.</ab>

        <ab>Advancing the health of all members of the global community remains core to the mission of the infectious diseases profession. Training, research, healthcare-delivery, and other infectious diseases-related institutions play a central role in meeting this goal. The promotion of inclusion, diversity, access, and equity (IDA&amp;E) is critical to harnessing the full range of human creativity, innovation, and talent necessary to realizing the education, research, patient care, and service missions that constitute the principal objectives of such institutions. Strong and positive institutional cultures and climates are essential to achieving these IDA&amp;E goals. We discuss opportunity gaps that exist in leveraging institutional culture and climate to optimize IDA&amp;E. We further identify effective strategies to address these gaps and achieve excellence in education, research, patient care, and service in infectious diseases and the broader healthcare and biomedical space. We discuss the importance of both local and global context in conceptualizing IDA&amp;E to best achieve these aims.</ab>

        <ab>Leadership at the board and executive levels across the nonprofit sector remains predominantly composed of white individuals, despite an increasingly diverse society. Research documents distinct benefits associated with diversity and inclusion, but efforts to move the dial have fallen short. This article explores how voluntary associations can prioritize racial/ethnic equity in their governance and provides specific steps for the examination of culture, practices, and processes required to operationalize change. There are a variety of professional societies and associations, also known as business leagues, established under the Internal Revenue Code. To be exempt, these organizations must be devoted to improving an industry or profession, as distinguished from performing particular services for individuals, and when successful they serve to improve the economic and social well-being of the entire nation.</ab>

        <ab>Advancing the health equity agenda for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA/NHPI) individuals has become an intersecting priority for federal agencies. However, the impact of federal investments and legislation to ensure systematic processes and resources to eliminate health disparities in AA/NHPI populations is unclear.</ab>
        <ab>To perform a portfolio review of clinical research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for AA/NHPI populations and determine the level of NIH investment in serving these populations.</ab>
        <ab>Cross-sectional study in which the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results system was queried for extramural AA/NHPI-focused clinical research projects conducted in the United States from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2018. Clinical research funded under research project grants, centers, cooperative awards, research career awards, training grants, and fellowships was included, with an advanced text search for AA/NHPI countries and cultures of origin. Project titles and terms were screened for inclusion and project abstracts were reviewed to verify eligibility. Descriptive analyses were completed.</ab>
        <ab>Outcomes included NIH funding trends and characteristics of funded projects and organizations. The proportions of AA/NHPI-related funding trends were calculated using 2 denominators, total NIH expenditures and clinical research expenditures.</ab>
        <ab>There were 5460 records identified, of which 891 studies were reviewed for eligibility. Of these, 529 clinical research studies focused on AA/NHPI participants composed 0.17% of the total NIH budget over 26 years. Projects studying AA/NHPI individuals in addition to other populations were funded across 17 NIH institutes and centers. The top 5 funders collectively contributed almost 60% of the total funding dollars for AA/NHPI projects and were the National Cancer Institute ($231 584 664), National Institute on Aging ($108 365 124), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ($67 232 910), National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities ($62 982 901), and National Institute on Mental Health ($60 072 779). Funding of these projects ($775 536 121) made up 0.17% of the overall NIH expenditures ($451 284 075 000) between 1992 and 2018, and 0.18% ($677 479 468) of the NIH research budget after 2000. Funding for AA/NHPI projects significantly increased over time, but the proportion of the total NIH budget has only increased from 0.12% before 2000 to 0.18% after 2000. Of total funding, 60.8% was awarded to research project grants compared with only 5.1% allocated to research career awards, training grants, and fellowships.</ab>
        <ab>Increases in research dollars for AA/NHPI clinical research were not associated with increases in the overall NIH research budget, and underrepresentation of AA/NHPI subgroups still remains. Without overt direction from federal entities and dedicated funds for health disparities research, as well as parallel efforts to increase diversity in the biomedical workforce, investments may continue to languish for AA/NHPI populations.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: The purpose of this research is to deepen the understanding of DEI training and show how scholars across the nation incorporated DEI leadership into academic roles. Faculty and administrators' experiential experience in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plays a role in the success or failure of DEI training. DEI training at institutes of higher learning should include metrics that examine our bias for invisible and overt support for DEI. Methods: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholars (RWJFNFS) were surveyed by The Gauda Group at Grayling. Data were collected from a diverse group of scholars across the nation. An online survey followed by an in-depth phone interview was used to assess participants' roles as leaders in academic nursing, challenges faced by scholars in addressing DEI, and perceived values of undertaking DEI activities. Results: Major themes emerged from the findings. The themes included championing for DEI comes with a personal and professional risk. Greater success was noted when DEI was supported by leadership and included in institutional strategic planning. Conclusion: DEI is important and necessitates commitment from all levels of leadership, faculty, and strategic planning initiatives. DEI training fills an important role and subsidizes leadership effectiveness as it relates to DEI.</ab>

        <ab>What do you bring to a conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion? While acknowledging this conversation is important, many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty shy away from engaging these topics. STEM educators often hesitate to participate in these discussions due to their self-perceived lack of knowledge or training. However, as institutions welcome ever-diversifying student populations, STEM faculty must consider how their teaching and mentoring approaches affect their students. During the 2018 American Physiological Society (APS) Institute for Teaching and Learning, STEM faculty and administrators engaged in conversations to better understand how their own approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion affect the success of their students. During my plenary workshop, "Inclusive Practices for Diverse Student Populations," participants investigated their own perspectives and practices. They also discussed approaches to implementing inclusive practices that complement active pedagogical best practices. In an attempt to replicate this workshop environment, I ask you to engage with an interactive set of exercises to investigate your own perspective on the topics of diversity, inclusion, and equity. After you consider your own approaches to these topics, I provide practical examples of inclusive practices that align or enhance active leaning pedagogy. By building confidence, providing support, and promoting various pathways to success, inclusive practices enhance student learning and decrease social disparities in STEM education, ultimately supporting STEM innovation.</ab>

        <ab>Group work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses is an effective means of improving student outcomes, and many different factors can influence the dynamics of student discussions and, ultimately, the success of collaboration. The substance and dynamics of group discussions are commonly examined using qualitative methods such as discourse analysis. To complement existing work in the literature, we developed a quantitative methodology that uses graph theory to map the progression of talk-turns of discussions within a group. We observed groups of students working with peer facilitators to solve problems in biological sciences, with three iterations of data collection and two major refinements of graph theory calculations. Results include general behaviors based on the turns in which different individuals talk and graph theory parameters to quantify group characteristics. To demonstrate the potential utility of the methodology, we present case studies with distinct patterns: a centralized group in which the peer facilitator behaves like an authority figure, a decentralized group in which most students talk their fair share of turns, and a larger group with subgroups that have implications for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Together, these results demonstrate that our adaptation of graph theory is a viable quantitative methodology to examine group discussions.</ab>

        <ab>Calls to increase medical class representativeness to better reflect the diversity of society represent a growing international trend. There is an inherent tension between these calls and competitive student selection processes driven by academic achievement. How is this tension manifested?</ab>
        <ab>Our three-phase interdisciplinary research programme focused on the discourses of excellence, equity and diversity in the medical school selection process, as conveyed by key stakeholders: (i) institutions and regulatory bodies (the websites of 17 medical schools and 15 policy documents from national regulatory bodies); (ii) admissions committee members (ACMs) (according to semi-structured interviews [n = 9]), and (iii) successful applicants (according to semi-structured interviews [n = 14]). The work is theoretically situated within the works of Foucault, Bourdieu and Bakhtin. The conceptual framework is supplemented by critical hermeneutics and the performance theories of Goffman.</ab>
        <ab>Academic excellence discourses consistently predominate over discourses calling for greater representativeness in medical classes. Policy addressing demographic representativeness in medicine may unwittingly contribute to the reproduction of historical patterns of exclusion of under-represented groups. In ACM selection practices, another discursive tension is exposed as the inherent privilege in the process is marked, challenging the ideal of medicine as a meritocracy. Applicants' representations of self in the 'performance' of interviewing demonstrate implicit recognition of the power inherent in the act of selection and are manifested in the use of explicit strategies to 'fit in'.</ab>
        <ab>How can this critical discourse analysis inform improved inclusiveness in student selection? Policymakers addressing diversity and equity issues in medical school admissions should explicitly recognise the power dynamics at play between the profession and marginalised groups. For greater inclusion and to avoid one authoritative definition of excellence, we suggest a transformative model of faculty development aimed at promoting multiple kinds of excellence. Through this multi-pronged approach, we call for the profession to courageously confront the cherished notion of the medical meritocracy in order to avoid unwanted aspects of elitism.</ab>

        <ab>Equity is fundamental to public health practice. However, limited work has evaluated public health units, as employers, in ensuring equitable workplaces. Public health units must examine their policies for promoting equity, diversity, and inclusiveness. We suggest strategies that these organizations may adopt to establish a diverse workforce, including programs of responsibility, broader advertisement of employment opportunities, and standardized application processes. These practices are site dependent and are more effective when supported by senior management. By considering these strategies, institutions of public health can improve equity, diversity, and inclusion in their workplaces while addressing health equity in the communities they serve.</ab>

        <ab>Evidence from outside surgery suggests that meritocracy-based processes around selection tend to reduce, rather than increase, diversity. In recent years, the surgical training boards have gone to considerable effort to achieve greater transparency and fairness in their selection processes, and to identify those attributes that are believed to best predict future success as a surgeon. This is consistent with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Diversity and Inclusion Plan, which places emphasis on gender equity and has goals that include increasing the attractiveness of surgery as a vocation for women, removing impediments to them applying to the surgical training programmes and removing any biases that might disadvantage them during the selection process.</ab>
        <ab>This study uses the Female Opportunity Index and rate ratio metrics to measure the level of female disadvantage in surgical selection, whether it be by the perception of its attractiveness to women which influences their application rates, or by the likelihood of successful selection for those who have applied, compared with their male counterparts.</ab>
        <ab>There are marked differences between the nine surgical specialties and 13 specialty training boards in both the proportion of women who apply, and the proportion who are successful in gaining entry onto the Surgical Education and Training programmes. The Female Opportunity Index ranged from 0.21 to 0.87, which represents a wide variation between surgical specialties.</ab>
        <ab>These data raise the question as to whether unconscious bias is occurring in an apparently meritocracy-based selection process in some specialties. The data also suggest that some specialties are relatively unattractive to women, for which the reasons are likely to be complex.</ab>

        <ab>The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network is a newly forming national community of practice that engages diversity, equity, and inclusion stakeholders in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. iEMBER was initiated with incubator funding from the National Science Foundation program for Research Coordination Networks in Undergraduate Biology Education. In June 2017, biology education researchers, social scientists, biologists, and program and policy administrators, all with interests in diversity, equity, and inclusion, met to lay the foundation for the iEMBER network. iEMBER provides a distinct forum to coordinate efforts through networking, professional development, and the initiation of collaborative research. iEMBER advances science, technology, engineering, and mathematics reform focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion through the initiation of research teams at the iEMBER biennial conference and outreach efforts at discipline-specific meetings and conferences. The focus of iEMBER is on understanding how to create inclusive, supportive, and engaging environments to foster the success of all biology students and trainees. This report focuses on the structure of the iEMBER network, two takeaways that emerged from the 2017 conference (interdisciplinary networking/collaboration and intradisciplinary broadening participation strategies), and ways for prospective members to engage in ongoing dialogue and future events.

        <ab>An emphasis on precision health (PH) has stimulated precision medicine studies to focus on the interplay of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors with disease risks, treatments, prognoses, and outcomes affecting health disparities. It is imperative, as well, that improving health equity among underserved populations remains central to the efforts and aims of PH.</ab>
        <ab>The aim if this study was to apply the transdisciplinary ConNECT Framework: A Model for Advancing Behavioral Medicine Science and Practice to Foster Health Equity to PH by integrating a population health agenda for reducing health disparities.</ab>
        <ab>There are five ConNECT principles: (a) integrating context; (b) fostering a norm of inclusion; (c) ensuring equitable diffusion of innovations; (d) harnessing communication technology; and (e) prioritizing specialized training as an organizing framework to PH, including examples of how to integrate behavioral and socioecological determinants to better understand the contexts of individuals, systems, and place to design targeted treatments and interventions.</ab>
        <ab>We describe proactive, actionable strategies for the systematic application of ConNECT Framework principles to address health equity via the PH initiative. Context and implications for nursing research and practice are also described.</ab>
        <ab>The ConNECT Framework emphasizes that diversity inclusion is imperative for true population health benefit from PH, broadly in public health, behavioral medicine, medicine, and nursing, to equip health researchers and practitioners to account for contextual socioecologic data that can be aligned with biologic data for more population responsive and individually tailored interventions to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases.</ab>

        <ab>This symposium includes 12 very brave and intimate narratives about the challenges associated with becoming a surgeon and practicing surgery as a woman. This symposium also includes three commentaries on the narratives written by 1) Patricia Dawson, MD, Ph.D., FACS, 2) Kelsey Medeiros, Ph.D, and Jennifer Griffith, Ph.D, and 3) Peter Angelos, MD, Ph.D., FACS. This narrative collection offers diverse female perspective on the impact of surgical training and practice, yet common themes emerge related to gender in the field of surgery. This symposium provides insight on surgical culture and traditions that are detrimental to surgeons in general, and woman surgeons in particular. It addresses how leadership and institutional changes must be made to equitably and successfully recruit, support, promote, and retain women training and practicing surgery. There is hope for the future of gender equity, diversity, and inclusion in the surgical workforce but only if its leaders adopt a zero tolerance policy against the range of gender-disparities identified and prioritize a culture of safety, dignity and equity.</ab>

        <ab>As part of their efforts to increase the diversity of their workforce and student body, medical schools, academic medical centers, and individual departments are increasingly crafting public statements about their value for and commitment to diversity. For these statements to effectively enhance diversity, however, care must be taken, as research shows that some diversity-related messages can backfire. To avoid the pitfalls and realize the promise of diversity statements, this article presents recommendations based on experimental studies that investigate the impact of diversity messages. These studies suggest that diversity statements be aspirational, emphasize autonomy, and express a value for difference. Aspirational statements avoid creating the impression that equity has been achieved, thus preventing the "illusion of fairness" and the "paradox of meritocracy," wherein espousing egalitarian values and the existence of a meritocracy can increase biased outcomes and workplace disparities. Statements that emphasize autonomy avoid the backlash that can occur when organizational members feel coerced into adopting prodiversity actions. Statements that emphasize the value of human differences convey a multicultural message that has shown positive outcomes compared with "colorblind" statements that acknowledge our common humanity. Although there are no studies specific to academic medicine, current research on a variety of organizations, including some studies from the health care industry, suggests that relying on these recommendations to craft a diversity statement may help contribute to academic medical centers' larger efforts to promote diversity and inclusion and may help them avoid some deleterious effects.</ab>

        <ab>The leadership of the American Surgical Association (ASA) appointed a Task Force to objectively address issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion with the discipline of academic surgery.</ab>
        <ab>Surgeons and the discipline of surgery, particularly academic surgery, have a tradition of leadership both in medicine and society. Currently, we are being challenged to harness our innate curiosity, hard work, and perseverance to address the historically significant deficiencies within our field in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</ab>
        <ab>The ASA leadership requested members to volunteer to serve on a Task Force to comprehensively address equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic surgery. Nine work groups reviewed the current literature, performed primary qualitative interviews, and distilled available guidelines and published primary source materials. A work product was created and published on the ASA Website and made available to the public. The full work product was summarized into this White Paper.</ab>
        <ab>The ASA has produced a handbook entitled: Ensuring Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Academic Surgery, which identifies issues and challenges, and develops a set of solutions and benchmarks to aid the academic surgical community in achieving these goals.</ab>
        <ab>Surgery must identify areas for improvement and work iteratively to address and correct past deficiencies. This requires honest and ongoing identification and correction of implicit and explicit biases. Increasing diversity in our departments, residencies, and universities will improve patient care, enhance productivity, augment community connections, and achieve our most fundamental ambition-doing good for our patients.</ab>

        <ab>Demographics in Canada, and the workplace, are changing. These include population changes due to race, ethnicity, religion/faith, immigration status, gender, sexual identity and orientation, disability, income, educational background, socioeconomic status, and literacy. While this rich diversity can present challenges for patient experiences/outcomes and working environments, it can also present opportunities for positive transformation. For successful transformation to take place, strategies should focus on "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" (DEI) versus "diversity" alone and on creating inclusive team environments for positive staff experiences/engagement. There is a growing understanding of the relationship between the providers' work environments, patient outcomes, and organizational performance. This article leverages the principle of improving the healthcare provider's experience based on Health Quality Ontario's Quadruple Aim ("people caring for people"). Based on learnings/experiences, the top three successful practices from the organization's DEI strategy have been outlined in this article.</ab>

        <ab>The Association of Academic Physiatrists (AAP) convened a women's task force in 2016, and the members agreed on a list of metrics that would permit retrospective data review pertaining to the representation and inclusion of women physicians in the society. Examples of categories examined included leadership positions (i.e., board membership, board presidents, committee membership, committee chairs, and resident fellow physician chairs), conference presentations (i.e., annual meeting session proposals, annual meeting faculty, annual meeting plenary speakers), and recognition awards (i.e., recognition award nominations and recipients). The findings highlight areas in which the Association of Academic Physiatrists has been successful in supporting gender equity and other areas in which women physiatrists have been underrepresented. The task force worked with the Board of Trustees to construct an action plan, asking the respective committees to address areas of underrepresentation. A volunteer from each committee was deemed a "diversity steward" and going forward will work directly with the task force as a liaison to document an action plan and collect data. The board plans to transparently report progress to members and other stakeholders, and the task force aims to publish a follow-up report within the next 5 years.</ab>

        <ab>A lack of diversity has been observed in radiation oncology (RO), with women and certain racial/ethnic groups underrepresented as trainees, faculty, and practicing physicians. We sought to gain a nuanced understanding of how to best promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) based on the insights of RO department chairs, with particular attention given to the experiences of the few women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in these influential positions.</ab>
        <ab>From March to June 2016, we conducted telephone interviews with 24 RO department chairs (of 27 invited). Purposive sampling was used to invite all chairs who were women (n = 13) or URMs (n = 3) and 11 male chairs who were not URMs. Multiple analysts coded the verbatim transcripts.</ab>
        <ab>Five themes were identified: (1) commitment to DEI promotes quality health care and innovation; (2) gaps remain despite some progress with promoting diversity in RO; (3) women and URM faculty continue to experience challenges in various career domains; (4) solutions to DEI issues would be facilitated by acknowledging realities of gender and race; and (5) expansion of the career pipeline is needed.</ab>
        <ab>The chairs' insights had policy-relevant implications. Bias training should broach tokenism, blindness, and intersectionality. Efforts to recruit and support diverse talent should be deliberate and proactive. Bridge programs could engage students before their application to medical school.</ab>

        <ab>Canada's history of nation building, combined with its status as a so-called middle power in international affairs, has been translated into an approach to global health that is focused on equity and global citizenship. Canada has often aspired to be a socially progressive force abroad, using alliance building and collective action to exert influence beyond that expected from a country with moderate financial and military resources. Conversely, when Canada has primarily used economic self-interest to define its global role, the country's perceived leadership in global health has diminished. Current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values, driven by appreciation for diversity, equality, and Canada's responsibility to be a good global citizen. However, poor coordination of efforts, limited funding, and the unaddressed legacy of Canada's colonisation of Indigenous peoples weaken the potential for Canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity. Amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world, the Canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage. Such leadership will require the translation of aspirational messages about health equity and inclusion into concrete action at home and internationally.</ab>

        <ab>There is much interest from stakeholders in understanding how health technology assessment (HTA) committees make national funding decisions for health technologies. A growing literature has analysed past decisions by committees (revealed preference, RP studies) and hypothetical decisions by committee members (stated preference, SP studies) to identify factors influencing decisions and assess their importance.</ab>
        <ab>A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to provide insight into committee preferences for these factors (after controlling for other factors) and the methods used to elicit them.</ab>
        <ab>Ovid Medline, Embase, Econlit and Web of Science were searched from inception to 11 May 2017. Included studies had to have investigated factors considered by HTA committees and to have conducted multivariate analysis to identify the effect of each factor on funding decisions. Factors were classified as being important based on statistical significance, and their impact on decisions was compared using marginal effects.</ab>
        <ab>Twenty-three RP and four SP studies (containing 42 analyses) of 14 HTA committees met the inclusion criteria. Although factors were defined differently, the SP literature generally found clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and equity factors (such as disease severity) were each important to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. These findings were supported by the RP studies of the PBAC, but not the other committees, which found funding decisions by these and other committees were mostly influenced by the acceptance of the clinical evidence and, where applicable, cost-effectiveness. Trust in the evidence was very important for decision makers, equivalent to reducing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year) by A$38,000 (Australian dollars) for the PBAC and £15,000 for NICE.</ab>
        <ab>This review found trust in the clinical evidence and, where applicable, cost-effectiveness were important for decision makers. Many methodological differences likely contributed to the diversity in some of the other findings across studies of the same committee. Further work is needed to better understand how competing factors are valued by different HTA committees.</ab>

        <ab>Despite decades of evidence gathering and calls for action, few countries have systematically attenuated health inequities (HI) through action on the social determinants of health (SDH). This is at least partly because doing so presents a significant political and policy challenge. This paper explores this challenge through a review of the empirical literature, asking: what factors have enabled and constrained the inclusion of the social determinants of health inequities (SDHI) in government policy agendas?</ab>
        <ab>A narrative review method was adopted involving three steps: first, drawing upon political science theories on agenda-setting, an integrated theoretical framework was developed to guide the review; second, a systematic search of scholarly databases for relevant literature; and third, qualitative analysis of the data and thematic synthesis of the results. Studies were included if they were empirical, met specified quality criteria, and identified factors that enabled or constrained the inclusion of the SDHI in government policy agendas.</ab>
        <ab>A total of 48 studies were included in the final synthesis, with studies spanning a number of country-contexts and jurisdictional settings, and employing a diversity of theoretical frameworks. Influential factors included the ways in which the SDHI were framed in public, media and political discourse; emerging data and evidence describing health inequalities; limited supporting evidence and misalignment of proposed solutions with existing policy and institutional arrangements; institutionalised norms and ideologies (ie, belief systems) that are antithetical to a SDH approach including neoliberalism, the medicalisation of health and racism; civil society mobilization; leadership; and changes in government.</ab>
        <ab>A complex set of interrelated, context-dependent and dynamic factors influence the inclusion or neglect of the SDHI in government policy agendas. It is better to think about these factors as increasing (or decreasing) the 'probability' of health equity reaching a government agenda, rather than in terms of 'necessity' or 'sufficiency.' Understanding these factors may help advocates develop strategies for generating political priority for attenuating HI in the future.</ab>

        <ab>The Diversity and Disparity in Biomedical Informatics (DDBI) workshop will be focused on complementary and critical issues concerned with enhancing diversity in the informatics workforce as well as diversity in patient cohorts. According to the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) at the NIH, diversity refers to the inclusion of the following traditionally underrepresented groups: African Americans/Blacks, Asians (&gt;30 countries), American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Latino or Hispanic (20 countries). Gender, culture, and socioeconomic status are also important dimensions of diversity, which may define some underrepresented groups. The under-representation of specific groups in both the biomedical informatics workforce as well as in the patient-derived data that is being used for research purposes has contributed to an ongoing disparity; these groups have not experienced equity in contributing to or benefiting from advancements in informatics research. This workshop will highlight innovative efforts to increase the pool of minority informaticians and discuss examples of informatics research that addresses the health concerns that impact minority populations. This workshop topics will provide insight into overcoming pipeline issues in the development of minority informaticians while emphasizing the importance of minority participation in health related research. The DDBI workshop will occur in two parts. Part I will discuss specific minority health &amp; health disparities research topics and Part II will cover discussions related to overcoming pipeline issues in the training of minority informaticians.</ab>

        <ab>Effective mentorship is critical to the success of early stage investigators, and has been linked to enhanced mentee productivity, self-efficacy, and career satisfaction. The mission of the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) is to provide all trainees across the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social sciences with evidence-based mentorship and professional development programming that emphasizes the benefits and challenges of diversity, inclusivity, and culture within mentoring relationships, and more broadly the research workforce. The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure and activities of NRMN.</ab>
        <ab>NRMN serves as a national training hub for mentors and mentees striving to improve their relationships by better aligning expectations, promoting professional development, maintaining effective communication, addressing equity and inclusion, assessing understanding, fostering independence, and cultivating ethical behavior. Training is offered in-person at institutions, regional training, or national meetings, as well as via synchronous and asynchronous platforms; the growing training demand is being met by a cadre of NRMN Master Facilitators. NRMN offers career stage-focused coaching models for grant writing, and other professional development programs. NRMN partners with diverse stakeholders from the NIH-sponsored Diversity Program Consortium (DPC), as well as organizations outside the DPC to work synergistically towards common diversity goals. NRMN offers a virtual portal to the Network and all NRMN program offerings for mentees and mentors across career development stages. NRMNet provides access to a wide array of mentoring experiences and resources including MyNRMN, Guided Virtual Mentorship Program, news, training calendar, videos, and workshops. National scale and sustainability are being addressed by NRMN "Coaches-in-Training" offerings for more senior researchers to implement coaching models across the nation. "Shark Tanks" provide intensive review and coaching for early career health disparities investigators, focusing on grant writing for graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and junior faculty.</ab>
        <ab>Partners from diverse perspectives are building the national capacity and sparking the institutional changes necessary to truly diversify and transform the biomedical research workforce. NRMN works to leverage resources towards the goals of sustainability, scalability, and expanded reach.</ab>

        <ab>Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs; provided without obligation) for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities (e.g. orphanhood, old age or HIV infection) are a type of social protection intervention that addresses a key social determinant of health (income) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided so long as the recipient engages in prescribed behaviours such as using a health service or attending school) is unknown.</ab>
        <ab>To assess the effects of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in vulnerable children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure and to compare to effects of UCTs versus CCTs.</ab>
        <ab>We searched 17 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE and Embase, in May 2017. We also searched six electronic grey literature databases and websites of key organisations, handsearched key journals and included records, and sought expert advice.</ab>
        <ab>We included both parallel group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort and controlled before-and-after (CBAs) studies, and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT or a smaller UCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.</ab>
        <ab>Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We tried to obtain missing data from study authors if feasible. For cluster-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method with random effects. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</ab>
        <ab>We included 21 studies (16 cluster-RCTs, 4 CBAs and 1 cohort study) involving 1,092,877 participants (36,068 children and 1,056,809 adults) and 31,865 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative synthesis. The 17 types of UCTs we identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 53.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT, and three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection and/or performance bias). Most studies were funded by national governments and/or international organisations.Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-quality evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-quality evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-quality evidence. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between 12 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09, P = 0.07, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 4972, I² = 2%, low-quality evidence). At one to two years, UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, very large reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the previous two weeks to three months (odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 8446, I² = 57%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence from five cluster-RCTs on food security was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that at 13 to 24 months' follow-up, UCTs could increase the likelihood of having been food secure over the previous month (low-quality evidence). UCTs may have increased participants' level of dietary diversity over the previous week, when assessed with the Household Dietary Diversity Score and followed up 24 months into the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.59 food categories, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.01, 4 cluster-RCTs, N = 9347, I² = 79%, low-quality evidence). Despite several studies providing relevant evidence, the effects of UCTs on the likelihood of being moderately stunted and on the level of depression remain uncertain. No evidence was available on the effect of a UCT on the likelihood of having died. UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the likelihood of currently attending school, when assessed at 12 to 24 months into the intervention (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09, 6 cluster-RCTs, N = 4800, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The evidence was uncertain for whether UCTs impacted livestock ownership, extreme poverty, participation in child labour, adult employment or parenting quality. Evidence from six cluster-RCTs on healthcare expenditure was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that UCTs may have increased the amount of money spent on health care at 7 to 24 months into the intervention (low-quality evidence). The effects of UCTs on health equity (or unfair and remedial health inequalities) were very uncertain. We did not identify any harms from UCTs. Three cluster-RCTs compared UCTs versus CCTs with regard to the likelihood of having used any health services, the likelihood of having had any illness or the level of dietary diversity, but evidence was limited to one study per outcome and was very uncertain for all three.</ab>
        <ab>This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), one social determinant of health (i.e. the likelihood of attending school), and healthcare expenditure. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of UCTs and CCTs remains very uncertain.</ab>

        <ab>Greater numbers of women in medicine have not resulted in more women achieving senior positions. Programs supporting the recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in academic medicine could help to achieve greater advancement of more women to leadership positions. Qualitative research was conducted to understand such programs at 23 institutions and, using the social ecological model, examine how they operate at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, academic community, and policy levels.</ab>
        <ab>Telephone interviews were conducted with faculty representatives (n = 44) of the Group on Women in Medicine and Science, Diversity and Inclusion, or senior leaders with knowledge on gender climate in 24 medical schools. Four trained interviewers conducted semistructured interviews that addressed faculty perceptions of gender equity and advancement, which were audiotaped and transcribed. The data were categorized into three content areas-recruitment, promotion, and retention-and coded a priori for each area based on their social ecological level of operation.</ab>
        <ab>Participants from nearly 40% of the institutions reported no special programs for recruiting, promoting, or retaining women, largely describing such programming as unnecessary. Existing programs primarily targeted the individual and interpersonal levels simultaneously, via training, mentoring, and networking, or the institutional level, via search committee trainings, child and elder care, and spousal hiring programs. Lesser effort at the academic community and policy levels were described.</ab>
        <ab>Our findings demonstrate that many U.S. medical schools have no programs supporting gender equity among medical faculty. Existing programs primarily target the individual or interpersonal level of the social ecological interaction. The academic community and broader policy environment require greater focus as levels with little attention to advancing women's careers. Universal multilevel efforts are needed to more effectively advance the careers of medical women faculty and support gender equity.</ab>

        <ab>The contention of this paper is that the context of social and therapeutic problems is critical to their resolution, and that many of them stem from historical and structural injustice. It focuses on the contextual issues of cultural, gender, and socioeconomic equity as providing important insights into authentic notions of social inclusion and well-being, and encourages therapists, service providers, researchers, and policy makers to take responsibility to ensure that these injustices are addressed, and become part of the public discourse about the sources and solutions of endemic social problems. Critique and deconstruction of institutional power in our public, private, and voluntary services is encouraged in a manner that honors diversity and enables sensitive therapy, other forms of service delivery and policy making that genuinely reflect the range of cultural, gender, and socioeconomic experiences of citizens.</ab>

        <ab>Midwifery educators and regulators in Canada have begun to address diversity, equity, and inclusion in admission processes and program curricula. Populations served by midwives value internationally educated midwives from their countries of origin. The International Midwifery Pre-Registration Program at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario, provides assessment, midwifery workplace orientation, and accelerated education for internationally educated midwives on behalf of the regulatory College of Midwives of Ontario. Between 2003 and 2015, midwives from 41 countries participated in the bridging program, and 214 (80%) successfully completed the program and qualified for licensure. Of these 214 graduates, 100% passed the Canadian Midwifery Registration Examination and 193 (90%) were employed full time as midwives within 4 months of graduation. The program curriculum enables the integration of these midwives into health care workplaces utilizing innovative approaches to assessment and competency enhancement. Critical to the bridging process are simulation-based practices to develop effective psychomotor learning, virtual and real primary care community placements, and coaching in empathetic, client-centered communication. Cultural sensitivity is embedded into the multiple assessment and learning modalities, and addresses relevant barriers faced by immigrant midwives in the workplace. Findings from the 13 years of the program may be applicable to increase diversity in other North American midwifery settings. This article describes the process, content, outcomes, and findings of the program. Midwifery educators and regulators may consider the utility of these approaches for their settings.</ab>

        <ab>A systematic literature review was carried out to study the benefits of teleconsultation and videoconferencing on the multifaceted process of diabetes care. Previous reviews focused primarily on usability of technology and considered mainly one-sided interventions.</ab>
        <ab>The objective was to determine the benefits and deficiencies of teleconsultation and videoconferencing regarding clinical, behavioral, and care coordination outcomes of diabetes care.</ab>
        <ab>Electronic databases (Medline, PiCarta, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Telemedicine Information Exchange, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar) were searched for relevant publications. The contribution to diabetes care was examined for clinical outcomes (eg, HbA(1c), blood pressure, quality of life), behavioral outcomes (patient-caregiver interaction, self-care), and care coordination outcomes (usability of technology, cost-effectiveness, transparency of guidelines, equity of care access). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with HbA(1c) as an outcome were pooled using standard meta-analytical methods.</ab>
        <ab>Of 852 publications identified, 39 met the inclusion criteria for electronic communication between (groups of) caregivers and patients with type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes. Studies that evaluated teleconsultation or videoconferencing not particularly aimed at diabetes were excluded, as were those that described interventions aimed solely at clinical improvements (eg, HbA(1c)). There were 22 interventions related to teleconsultation, 13 to videoconferencing, and 4 to combined teleconsultation and videoconferencing. The heterogeneous nature of the identified videoconferencing studies did not permit a formal meta-analysis. Pooled results from the six RCTs of the identified teleconsultation studies did not show a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (0.03%, 95% CI = - 0.31% to 0.24%) compared to usual care. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity among the pooled RCTs (chi(2) (7)= 7.99, P = .33). It can be concluded that in the period under review (1994-2006) 39 studies had a scope broader than clinical outcomes and involved interventions allowing patient-caregiver interaction. Most of the reported improvements concerned satisfaction with technology (26/39 studies), improved metabolic control (21/39), and cost reductions (16/39). Improvements in quality of life (6/39 studies), transparency (5/39), and better access to care (4/39) were hardly observed. Teleconsultation programs involving daily monitoring of clinical data, education, and personal feedback proved to be most successful in realizing behavioral change and reducing costs. The benefits of videoconferencing were mainly related to its effects on socioeconomic factors such as education and cost reduction, but also on monitoring disease. Additionally, videoconferencing seemed to maintain quality of care while producing cost savings.</ab>
        <ab>The selected studies suggest that both teleconsultation and videoconferencing are practical, cost-effective, and reliable ways of delivering a worthwhile health care service to diabetics. However, the diversity in study design and reported findings makes a strong conclusion premature. To further the contribution of technology to diabetes care, interactive systems should be developed that integrate monitoring and personalized feedback functions.</ab>

        <ab>Academic medicine has initiated changes in policy, practice, and programs over the past several decades to address persistent gender disparity and other issues pertinent to its sociocultural context. Three career development programs were implemented to prepare women faculty to succeed in academic medicine: two sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which began a professional development program for early career women faculty in 1988. By 1995, it had evolved into two programs one for early career women and another for mid-career women. By 2012, more than 4000 women faculty from medical schools across the U.S and Canada had participated in these intensive 3-day programs. The third national program, the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine(®) (ELAM) program for women, was developed in 1995 at the Drexel University College of Medicine.</ab>
        <ab>Narratives from telephone interviews representing reflections on 78 career development seminars between 1988 and 2010 describe the dynamic relationships between individual, institutional, and sociocultural influences on participants' career advancement.</ab>
        <ab>The narratives illuminate the pathway from participating in a career development program to self-defined success in academic medicine in revealing a host of influences that promoted and/or hindered program attendance and participants' ability to benefit after the program in both individual and institutional systems. The context for understanding the importance of these career development programs to women's advancement is nestled in the sociocultural environment, which includes both the gender-related influences and the current status of institutional practices that support women faculty.</ab>
        <ab>The findings contribute to the growing evidence that career development programs, concurrent with strategic, intentional support of institutional leaders, are necessary to achieve gender equity and diversity inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>To guide action towards a community-based dementia care strategy, Morton-Chang et al. provide the following three key strategic pillars: putting people with dementia first, supporting informal caregivers and enabling local communities to support people with dementia. While, in principle we agree with these pillars, the ways in which we interpret and implement them differ. We propose three values that should underlie any discussion of dementia policy, strategy and change and that place people with dementia at the heart of these discussions: that of the rights of people with dementia, of diversity and equity, and inclusion.</ab>

        <ab>Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) are a common social protection intervention that increases income, a key social determinant of health, in disaster contexts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</ab>
        <ab>To assess the effects of UCTs in improving health services use, health outcomes, social determinants of health, health care expenditure, and local markets and infrastructure in LMICs. We also compared the relative effectiveness of UCTs delivered in-hand with in-kind transfers, conditional cash transfers, and UCTs paid through other mechanisms.</ab>
        <ab>We searched 17 academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE, and EMBASE between May and July 2014 for any records published up until 4 May 2014. We also searched grey literature databases, organisational websites, reference lists of included records, and academic journals, as well as seeking expert advice.</ab>
        <ab>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as cohort, interrupted time series, and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs) on UCTs in LMICs. Primary outcomes were the use of health services and health outcomes.</ab>
        <ab>Two authors independently screened all potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the included studies' risk of bias. We requested missing information from the study authors.</ab>
        <ab>Three studies (one cluster-RCT and two CBAs) comprising a total of 13,885 participants (9640 children and 4245 adults) as well as 1200 households in two LMICs (Nicaragua and Niger) met the inclusion criteria. They examined five UCTs between USD 145 and USD 250 (or more, depending on household characteristics) that were provided by governmental, non-governmental or research organisations during experiments or pilot programmes in response to droughts. Two studies examined the effectiveness of UCTs, and one study examined the relative effectiveness of in-hand UCTs compared with in-kind transfers and UCTs paid via mobile phone. Due to the methodologic limitations of the retrieved records, which carried a high risk of bias and very serious indirectness, we considered the body of evidence to be of very low overall quality and thus very uncertain across all outcomes.Depending on the specific health services use and health outcomes examined, the included studies either reported no evidence that UCTs had impacted the outcome, or they reported that UCTs improved the outcome. No single outcome was reported by more than one study. There was a very small increase in the proportion of children who received vitamin or iron supplements (mean difference (MD) 0.10 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.14) and on the child's home environment, as well as clinically meaningful, very large reductions in the chance of child death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66) and the incidence of severe acute malnutrition (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80). There was also a moderate reduction in the number of days children spent sick in bed (MD - 0.36 SDs, 95% CI - 0.62 to - 0.10). There was no evidence for any effect on the proportion of children receiving deworming drugs, height for age among children, adults' level of depression, or the quality of parenting behaviour. No adverse effects were identified. The included comparisons did not examine several important outcomes, including food security and equity impacts.With regard to the relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with a food transfer providing a relatively high total caloric value, there was no evidence that a UCT had any effect on the chance of child death (HR 2.27, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.44) or severe acute malnutrition (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.99). A UCT paid in-hand led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the household dietary diversity score, compared with the same UCT paid via mobile phone (difference-in-differences estimator 0.43 scores, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80), but there was no evidence for an effect on social determinants of health, health service expenditure, or local markets and infrastructure.</ab>
        <ab>Additional high-quality evidence (especially RCTs of humanitarian disaster contexts other than droughts) is required to reach clear conclusions regarding the effectiveness and relative effectiveness of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in humanitarian disasters in LMICs.</ab>

        <ab>The systematic review has increasingly become a popular tool for researching health policy. However, due to the complexity and diversity in the health policy research, it has also encountered more challenges. We set out the Cochrane reviews on health policy research as a representative to provide the first examination of epidemiological and descriptive characteristics as well as the compliance of methodological quality with the AMSTAR. 99 reviews were included by inclusion criteria, 73% of which were Implementation Strategies, 15% were Financial Arrangements and 12% were Governance Arrangements; involved Public Health (34%), Theoretical Exploration (18%), Hospital Management (17%), Medical Insurance (12%), Pharmaceutical Policy (9%), Community Health (7%) and Rural Health (2%). Only 39% conducted meta-analysis, and 49% reported being updates, and none was rated low methodological quality. Our research reveals that the quantity and quality of the evidence should be improved, especially Financial Arrangements and Governance Arrangements involved Rural Health, Health Care Reform and Health Equity, etc. And the reliability of AMSTAR needs to be tested in larger range in this field.</ab>

        <ab>Women have entered academic medicine in significant numbers for 4 decades and now comprise 20% of full-time faculty. Despite this, women have not reached senior positions in parity with men. We sought to explore the gender climate in academic medicine as perceived by representatives to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Group on Women in Medicine and Science (GWIMS) and Group on Diversity and Inclusion (GDI).</ab>
        <ab>We conducted a qualitative analysis of semistructured telephone interviews with GWIMS and GDI representatives and other senior leaders at 24 randomly selected medical schools of the 1995 National Faculty Study. All were in the continental United States, balanced for public/private status and AAMC geographic region. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and organized into content areas before an inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Themes that were expressed by multiple informants were studied for patterns of association.</ab>
        <ab>Five themes were identified: (1) a perceived wide spectrum in gender climate; (2) lack of parity in rank and leadership by gender; (3) lack of retention of women in academic medicine (the "leaky pipeline"); (4) lack of gender equity in compensation; and (5) a disproportionate burden of family responsibilities and work-life balance on women's career progression.</ab>
        <ab>Key informants described improvements in the climate of academic medicine for women as modest. Medical schools were noted to vary by department in the gender experience of women, often with no institutional oversight. Our findings speak to the need for systematic review by medical schools and by accrediting organizations to achieve gender equity in academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>A diverse medical school faculty is critical to preparing physicians to provide quality care to an increasingly diverse nation. The authors sought to compare experiences of underrepresented in medicine minority (URMM) faculty with those of non-URMM faculty in a nationally representative sample of medical schools.</ab>
        <ab>In 2007-2009, the authors surveyed a stratified random sample of 4,578 MD and PhD full-time faculty from 26 U.S. medical schools. Multiple regression models were used to test for differences between URMM and other faculty on 12 dimensions of academic culture. Weights were used to adjust for oversampling of URMM and female faculty.</ab>
        <ab>The response rate was 52%, or 2,381 faculty. The analytic sample was 2,218 faculty: 512 (23%) were URMM, and 1,172 (53%) were female, mean age 49 years. Compared with non-URMM faculty, URMM faculty endorsed higher leadership aspirations but reported lower perceptions of relationships/inclusion, gave their institutions lower scores on URMM equity and institutional efforts to improve diversity, and more frequently engaged in disparities research. Twenty-two percent (115) had experienced racial/ethnic discrimination. For both values alignment and institutional change for diversity, URMM faculty at two institutions with high proportions (over 50%) of URMM faculty rated these characteristics significantly higher than their counterparts at traditional institutions.</ab>
        <ab>Encouragingly, for most aspects of academic medicine, the experiences of URMM and non-URMM faculty are similar, but the differences raise important concerns. The combination of higher leadership aspirations with lower feelings of inclusion and relationships might lead to discouragement with academic medicine.</ab>

        <ab>Many urban areas struggle with significant health disparities. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is a 14-year difference in life expectancy between the predominantly African American population in north Tulsa and the predominantly Caucasian population in south Tulsa. The roots of Tulsa's health disparities can be linked, in part, to a long history of racial mistrust stemming from the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, arguably one of the worst race riots in U.S. history. In 2011, the author served as both a university campus president and chairman of the board of the Tulsa region's chamber of commerce. Through his work with the chamber, he discovered the business community's substantial resources and advocacy abilities. He also found that regional business leaders strongly supported health equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives, both as moral obligations and regional economic development imperatives. After sharing the lessons he learned from working closely with business leaders, the author encourages other academic health centers (AHCs) to reach out to their business communities, which are likely willing and able to help them undertake similar initiatives. In doing so, AHCs and businesses can work together to improve the economic vitality of their regions.</ab>

        <ab>Commissioners of Health Technology Assessments require timely reviews to attain efficacious decisions on healthcare and treatments. In recent years, there has been an emergence of 'rapid reviews' within Health Technology Assessments; however, there is no known published guidance or agreed methodology within recognised systematic review or Health Technology Assessment guidelines. In order to answer the research question 'What is a rapid review and is methodology consistent in rapid reviews of Health Technology Assessments?', a study was undertaken in a sample of rapid review Health Technology Assessments from the Health Technology Assessment database within the Cochrane Library and other specialised Health Technology Assessment databases to investigate similarities and/or differences in rapid review methodology utilised.</ab>
        <ab>In a targeted search to obtain a manageable sample of rapid reviews, the Health Technology Assessment database of The Cochrane Library and six international Health Technology Assessment databases were searched to locate rapid review Health Technology Assessments from 2000 onwards. Each rapid review was examined to investigate the individual methodology used for searching, inclusion screening, quality assessment, data extraction and synthesis. Methods of each rapid review were compared to investigate differences and/or similarities in methodologies used, in comparison with recognised methods for systematic reviews.</ab>
        <ab>Forty-six full rapid reviews and three extractable summaries of rapid reviews were included. There was a wide diversity of methodology, with some reviews utilising well-established systematic review methods, but many others diversifying in one or more areas, that is searching, inclusion screening, quality assessment, data extraction, synthesis methods, report structure and number of reviewers. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of recommended review methodologies utilised and length of time taken in months.</ab>
        <ab>Despite the number of rapid reviews published within Health Technology Assessments over recent years, there is no agreed and tested methodology and it is unclear how rapid reviews differ from systematic reviews. In a sample of Health Technology Assessment rapid reviews from 2000 to 2011, there was a wide diversity of methodology utilised in all aspects of rapid reviews. There is scope for wider research in this area to investigate the diversity of methods in more depth during each stage of the rapid review process, so that eventually recommendations could be made for clear and systematic methods for rapid reviews, thus facilitating equity and credibility of this type of important review methodology.</ab>

        <ab>There has been limited identification of core lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or intersexed (LGBTI) experience concepts that should be included in the nursing curricula. This article addresses the gap in the literature. To move nursing toward the goals of health equity and cultural humility in practice, education, and research, nursing curricula must integrate core LGBTI concepts, experiences, and needs related to health and illness. This article reviews LGBTI health care literature to address the attitudes, knowledge, and skills needed to address curricular gaps and provide content suggestions for inclusion in nursing curricula. Also considered is the need to expand nursing students' definition of diversity before discussing the interplay between nurses' attitudes and culturally competent care provided to persons who are LGBTI. Knowledge needed includes a life span perspective that addresses developmental needs and their impact on health concerns throughout the life course; health promotion and disease prevention with an articulation of unique health issues for this population; mental health concerns; specific health needs of transgender and intersex individuals; barriers to health care; interventions and resources including Internet sites; and legal and policy issues. Particular assessment and communication skills for LGBTI patients are identified. Finally, there is a discussion of didactic, simulation, and clinical strategies for incorporating this content into nursing curricula at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</ab>

        <ab>This article considers how health services access and equity documents represent the problem of access to health services and what the effects of that representation might be for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. We conducted a critical discourse analysis on selected access and equity documents using a gender-based diversity framework as determined by two objectives: 1) to identify dominant and counter discourses in health services access and equity literature; and 2) to develop understanding of how particular discourses impact the inclusion, or not, of LGBT communities in health services access and equity frameworks.The analysis was conducted in response to public health and clinical research that has documented barriers to health services access for LGBT communities including institutionalized heterosexism, biphobia, and transphobia, invisibility and lack of health provider knowledge and comfort. The analysis was also conducted as the first step of exploring LGBT access issues in home care services for LGBT populations in Ontario, Canada.</ab>
        <ab>A critical discourse analysis of selected health services access and equity documents, using a gender-based diversity framework, was conducted to offer insight into dominant and counter discourses underlying health services access and equity initiatives.</ab>
        <ab>A continuum of five discourses that characterize the health services access and equity literature were identified including two dominant discourses: 1) multicultural discourse, and 2) diversity discourse; and three counter discourses: 3) social determinants of health (SDOH) discourse; 4) anti-oppression (AOP) discourse; and 5) citizen/social rights discourse.</ab>
        <ab>The analysis offers a continuum of dominant and counter discourses on health services access and equity as determined from a gender-based diversity perspective. The continuum of discourses offers a framework to identify and redress organizational assumptions about, and ideological commitments to, sexual and gender diversity and health services access and equity. Thus, the continuum of discourses may serve as an important element of a health care organization's access and equity framework for the evaluation of access to good quality care for diverse LGBT populations. More specfically, the analysis offers four important points of consideration in relation to the development of a health services access and equity framework.</ab>

        <ab>A systematic literature review, covering publications from 1994 to 2009, was carried out to determine the effects of teleconsultation regarding clinical, behavioral, and care coordination outcomes of diabetes care compared to usual care. Two types of teleconsultation were distinguished: (1) asynchronous teleconsultation for monitoring and delivering feedback via email and cell phone, automated messaging systems, or other equipment without face-to-face contact; and (2) synchronous teleconsultation that involves real-time, face-to-face contact (image and voice) via videoconferencing equipment (television, digital camera, webcam, videophone, etc.) to connect caregivers and one or more patients simultaneously, e.g., for the purpose of education.</ab>
        <ab>Electronic databases were searched for relevant publications about asynchronous and synchronous tele-consultation [Medline, Picarta, Psychinfo, ScienceDirect, Telemedicine Information Exchange, Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, Google Scholar]. Reference lists of identified publications were hand searched. The contribution to diabetes care was examined for clinical outcomes [e.g., hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), dietary values, blood pressure, quality of life], for behavioral outcomes (patient-caregiver interaction, self-care), and for care coordination outcomes (usability of technology, cost-effectiveness, transparency of guidelines, equity of access to care). Randomized controlled trials with HbA1c as an outcome were pooled using standard meta-analytical methods.</ab>
        <ab>Of 2060 publications identified, 90 met inclusion criteria for electronic communication between (groups of) caregivers and patients with type 1 and 2 or gestational diabetes. Studies that evaluated teleconsultation not particularly aimed at diabetes were excluded, as were those that described interventions aimed solely at clinical improvements (e.g., HbA1c or lipid profiles). In 63 of 90 interventions, the interaction had an asynchronous teleconsultation character, in 18 cases interaction was synchronously (videoconferencing), and 9 involved a combination of synchronous with asynchronous interaction. Most of the reported improvements concerned clinical values (n = 49), self-care (n = 46), and satisfaction with technology (n = 43). A minority of studies demonstrated improvements in patient-caregiver interactions (n = 28) and cost reductions (n = 27). Only a few studies reported enhanced quality of life (n = 12), transparency of health care (n = 7), and improved equity in care delivery (n = 4). Asynchronous and synchronous applications appeared to differ in the type of contribution they made to diabetes care compared to usual care: asynchronous applications were more successful in improving clinical values and self-care, whereas synchronous applications led to relatively high usability of technology and cost reduction in terms of lower travel costs for both patients and care providers and reduced unscheduled visits compared to usual care. The combined applications (n = 9) scored best according to quality of life (22.2%). No differences between synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultation could be observed regarding the positive effect of technology on the quality of patient-provider interaction. Both types of applications resulted in intensified contact and increased frequency of transmission of clinical values with respect to usual care. Fifteen of the studies contained HbA1c data that permitted pooling. There was significant statistical heterogeneity among the pooled randomized controlled trials (chi(2) = 96.46, P &lt; 0.001). The pooled reduction in HbA1c was not statically significant (weighted mean difference -0.10; 95% confidence interval -0.39 to 0.18).</ab>
        <ab>The included studies suggest that both synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultations for diabetes care are feasible, cost-effective, and reliable. However, it should be noted that many of the included studies showed no significant differences between control (usual care) and intervention groups. This might be due to the diversity and lack of quality in study designs (e.g., inaccurate or incompletely reported sample size calculations). Future research needs quasi-experimental study designs and a holistic approach that focuses on multilevel determinants (clinical, behavioral, and care coordination) to promote self-care and proactive collaborations between health care professionals and patients to manage diabetes care. Also, a participatory design approach is needed in which target users are involved in the development of cost-effective and personalized interventions. Currently, too often technology is developed within the scope of the existing structures of the health care system. Including patients as part of the design team stimulates and enables designers to think differently, unconventionally, or from a new perspective, leading to applications that are better tailored to patients' needs.</ab>

        <ab>Recent literature on the lack of efficiency and acceptability of publicly provided health services has led to an interest in the use of partnerships with the private sector to deliver public services.</ab>
        <ab>To assess the effectiveness of contracting out healthcare services in improving access to care in low and middle-income countries and, where possible, health outcomes.</ab>
        <ab>We searched a wide range of international databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature. The original searches were conducted between November 2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May 2009.</ab>
        <ab>Contracting out health services is defined as the provision of healthcare services on behalf of the government by non-state providers. Studies had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, health expenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Studies also needed to use one of the following study designs: randomised controlled trial, non-randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis or controlled before and after study.</ab>
        <ab>We made an attempt to present results from the different studies in a systematic way, however due to the diversity of sources, contexts and methods used, we undertook a narrative synthesis.</ab>
        <ab>Three studies met our inclusion criteria (one after re-analysis of data). These studies suggest that contracting out services to non-state providers can increase access and utilisation of health services. One study found a reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures and improvement in some health outcomes. However, methodological weaknesses and particularities of the reported programme settings limit the strength and generalisability of their conclusions.</ab>
        <ab>Three studies suggest that contracting out may be an appropriate response to scale up service delivery in particular settings, such as post-conflict or fragile states. Evidence was not presented on whether this approach was more effective than making a similar investment in the public sector, as there was not an exact control available in any of the settings. In addition, the introduction of non-state providers into some settings and not others also brings many potentially confounding variables, such as the presence of additional management expertise or expatriate doctors, which may improve drug supply or increase utilisation.</ab>

        <ab>This article outlines a road map to achieving organizational excellence by identifying the structures, conditions, and practices necessary to institutionalize both the core values of diversity transformation (inclusion, respect, fairness, and equity) and the core clinical and administrative practices that drive organizational high performance and improvement. Fundamentally, this approach takes as a given the interrelatedness of clinical quality, operational efficiency, and work culture. Cultural competence requires the transformation of not just clinical practice but the systems by which care is organized and delivered.</ab>
