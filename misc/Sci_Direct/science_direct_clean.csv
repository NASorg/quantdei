Collegiate Aviation Review International,2021,9,"Teaching Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Aviation Education.","Over the last decade, many companies have begun to recognize the value of a diverse workforce, equity within the workforce, and inclusion practices. Recent global events have pushed the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the aviation workplace and education higher on the priority list for many. Unfortunately, the aviation industry continues to have difficulty in attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Notwithstanding this struggle in the industry, those in education must find ways to educate our students on topics relating to DEI. It is critically important that this training is rooted in research. The aviation industry is starting to see increased research initiatives to promote DEI among all generations. However, integrating DEI in the aviation classroom can be challenging, as many faculty members might not feel comfortable addressing the topic in relation to their courses. Therefore, this research focused on inclusive teaching and dynamic lecture strategies that will enable educators to reflect on critical consciousness, be mindful of implicit bias, and handle resistance while fostering a safe space.","Albelo, Jorge L.

Change,2023,1,"DEI Institutionalization: Measuring Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Postsecondary Education.","The Council for Higher Education Accreditation recently announced new standards that include assessing and addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in higher education. Institutionalization of DEI initiatives in postsecondary education is important to creating an equitable environment for all students. A DEI assessment was developed that is unique in addressing DEI at the institution level rather than aggregating individual-level data to describe the institution with strong reliability and validity evidence. Focus groups indicated that the assessment provided a framework for improving DEI, as well as a launching pad for discussing and planning DEI initiatives. While 73% of institutions reported that DEI is addressed directly through their mission statements, there is still much work to be done to improve the gaps in student outcomes.","Cumming, Tammie","Miller, M.

There are ethical and practical concerns when we lose out on diversifying the chemical sciences and benefitting from the greater contributions of thinkers from diverse backgrounds working together in the classroom and workplace. The principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical for resolving the current imbalance. Continuous reflection by faculty is an essential component for the improvement process, as are understanding value and embracing change. Strategies for making students feel a sense of belonging in a course, research laboratory, and discipline include ensuring the educational climate is safe, accessible, and respectful; making the learning experience relatable and providing access to role models; and providing research experiences and exposure to the field. While the focus of this Point of View is on chemical education, the conversation and best practices are applicable and extend to teaching and mentoring in other fields of science.","Rogers, Reginald","Pagano, Todd","Associate professor in the Department of Biomedical, Biological, and Chemical Engineering at the University of Missouri"

American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education,2023,4,"Review of Best Practices for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committees Within Colleges of Pharmacy.","Objective. To provide a review of best practices for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committees at United States colleges of pharmacy. Findings. In colleges of pharmacy, DEI committees can play a crucial role in promoting a culture change to ensure pharmacy graduates are equipped to provide equitable and representative care for the patients they serve. There is limited literature available on DEI committee composition, roles, and responsibilities, and their place within a college of pharmacy’s organizational structure. A commitment to DEI should be part of the college’s strategic plan and embedded and supported at all levels of the college and university to ensure success of DEI-related strategic initiatives. For a DEI committee to be effective, its composition should be intentional to include change agents, campus leaders, and members who are passionate and knowledgeable to execute the DEI goals. For sustainable change, involvement of the entire learning community and an organizational culture change is also important. Thus, DEI committees need to establish active bidirectional collaborations and communication with all key committees, offices, community leaders, and alumni to implement diversity goals. Summary. The DEI committee’s established place in the organizational structure of the college is essential to ensure fair and appropriate representation of the community it serves. A clearly defined DEI committee with committee composition, roles, responsibilities, and its association with all constituents of the college and community can help achieve its intended strategic goals.","Kolluru, Srikanth","Wanat, Matthew A.","KGI School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Claremont, California."

In the months that followed, members learned to navigate the challenges of goal setting, collaborating with others outside the library, funding, event planning, and marketing. One of the primary goals of the Committee was to initiate and maintain conversations and collaborations around equity, inclusion, and diversity. Efforts included the celebration of Native American heritage and culture, women's history, hip-hop history, and others. Another goal was to produce a meaningful and relevant mission to serve as a guide for our fledgling committee. The committee's efforts were inclusive of the communities both outside and inside of the library's sphere. Efforts were made to increase awareness and sensitivity among our library personnel via lectures, self-reflection workshops, and discussions. Further, committee members' attendance and participation at conferences and webinars provided many opportunities to engage in discussions with others who have started similar committees at their libraries.","Ramonetti, Mona","Pilato, Victoria",

The teachers were carefully selected to encompass a multitude of identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, location, class, ability, teaching setting, musical background, and teaching experience. Through our conversations, we learned how these teachers locate their identities through their own narratives and how these social constructions converge in their work through pedagogical and curricular strategies. It is our hope that their insights might start a conversation about the current state of DEI work being approached in music education and provide suggestions for more diverse, equitable, and inclusive practices and policies in music classrooms.","Bernard, Cara","Talbot, Brent C.",

Former and recent graduates of pharmacy schools remain deficient in their knowledge of DEIA topics such as unconscious bias, which can directly influence health outcomes in an undesirable manner. Particular DEIA areas that are pertinent to pharmacy practice include: race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability status, religion, socioeconomic status, and political beliefs. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) affirmed its commitment to DEIA as a priority. However, existing gaps in knowledge of pharmacy graduates in this area have the potential to contribute to health disparities and inequities, which are significant public health issues. We call on academic pharmacy institutions and professional pharmacy organizations to elevate DEIA topics and to designate them as essential to both addressing health equity and improving care for underserved populations. We also implore licensing boards to require continuing education related to DEIA as a foundational step to closing the knowledge gap for pharmacists in this area.","Arif, Sally A.","Butler, Lakesha M.","Midwestern University, College of Pharmacy, Rush University Medical Center, Downers Grove, Illinois"
Journal of Natural & Applied Sciences,2018,9,"Inclusive Education and the ""Balkanization"" Professionalization of the Specialized Field of Studies in Special Education Postgraduate Programs: The Case of Sweden.","This short paper has two pronged purposes. The first is to reflect on policies and practices of inclusive education in Sweden and the second is to problematize the implications of the continuous proliferation of the specialized field of studies in Special Education postgraduate programs in Sweden. The current Swedish political and educational discourses reflect contradictions and dilemmas among varied dimensions of the educational arena. Policy and practice decisions involve dilemmas. Sweden may be characterized by an embodiment of a strong philosophy of universalism, equal entitlements of citizenship, comprehensiveness, and solidarity as an instrument to promote social inclusion and equality of resources. Within the past decades, however, the country has undergone a dramatic transformation. The changes are framed within neo-liberal philosophies such as devolution, market solutions, competition, effectivity, and standardization, coupled with a proliferation of individual/parent choices for independent schools, all of which potentially work against the valuing of diversity, equity and inclusion (Berhanu, 2011, 2016). The second concern of this paper is: Does the current specialization or diversified form of studies within Special Education postgraduate programs (Teacher Training Programs) support the inclusive agenda, or does it hamper the vision? In addition, recent developments to create new categories or subcategories of special education have the potential not only to tie up administrative and diagnostic resources but also to create an increasingly less manageable array of separate special education programs. This Balkanization process with regard to a number of select disorders has advantages and disadvantages. My concern is that the very existence of ""highly specialized knowledge domains"" may result in a new form of exclusion and segregation. This is a scenario that one can imagine or expect with the proliferation or balkanization of specialized studies in numerous strands unless we plan carefully as to how to utilize these skills and expertise within inclusive settings.","Berhanu, Girma",,"Department of Education University of Gothenburg Box 300, SE 405 30 Göteborg, Sweden"

Academic libraries have an established history of offering virtual services and providing online resources for students, faculty, staff, and the general public. In addition to these services and resources, information on academic library websites can contribute to an institution's demonstration of value placed on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

Descriptive analysis revealed 12 of 16 member libraries had explicitly labeled DEI statements in November 2020, with an additional member updating their website to include such a statement in early 2021. Content analysis examined how the existing statements contributed to institutional value of and commitment to DEI, and multi-modal theory explored the communicative aspects of DEI statement content. Analysis revealed vague conceptualizations of diversity and library-centered language in DEI statements, while a subset of statements employed anti-racist and social justice language to position the library as an active agent for social change.

Using data from a qualitative study in a rural secondary school in Spain, the author found that school personnel effectively distinguished between cultural needs and cognitive deficits. However, a one-way model of assimilation, a knowledge transmission model of pedagogy and the retention of the traditional canon as the goal of secondary learning defeated the school's efforts to implement inclusion for both groups of students in particular, Moroccan immigrants.

Pathogens & Disease,2022,1,The role of mentoring in promoting diversity equity and inclusion in STEM Education and Research.,"The success of mentoring derives from active and respectful listening and the willingness to learn and accept opportunities for personal growth. This shapes every trainee and their destined path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The act of cultivating rapport, asking, and pondering meaningful questions, and receiving constructive feedback are critical to support a productive mentoring relationship. Successful mentoring in STEM can be established and allow mentees, especially underrepresented minorities (URMs), to flourish in an environment where they feel welcomed and supported. However, mentees from underrepresented groups often experience inadequate mentoring due to a mentor's lack of awareness, poor trainings themselves, or lack of understanding of the mentee's hardships. It is important for mentors and mentees to work together to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM education through creativity, authenticity, and networking. We analyzed data obtained from students who attended a recent workshop that are interested in going to graduate school. Our results show that despite low initial expectations for the workshop, many students were satisfied in the knowledge they gleaned. The future and role of diversity in STEM within these underrepresented groups lies in community support and an important role that they can play in the lives of others through DEI initiatives and throughout their careers all of which involves positive mentoring.","Marshall, Andrea G","Vue, Zer","Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University , Nashville, TN 37232, United States"

Methods: Developed by the library's DEI Team and preceded by a pilot assessment, the survey posed 17 Likert Scale questions and 2 free-text response questions on the topics of belonging, inclusivity, equitability, emotional and physical safety, and commitment to DEI. The survey was created in Qualtrics, pilot tested, and launched in February 2020 for approximately 12 weeks. Results: Objective question responses were received from 101 individuals, with 24 open-ended responses. The quantitative findings showed largely positive perceptions of the DEI climate. Questions about feeling welcome and feeling physically safe were among those with the highest responses. The three lower-scoring questions indicate areas for improvement, including services for people whose native language is not English, for individuals with disabilities, and for families. The qualitative findings indicate the library's strengths include its exhibitions, welcoming atmosphere, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity initiatives. In contrast, opportunities for enhancement encompass non-English language resources, website updates, and accessibility to some physical spaces. Conclusion: The DEI Team is using the online survey data to enhance library services, staffing, programming, policies, and spaces. These improvements include looking into providing a space for patrons with families, expanding services for individuals whose first language is not English, assessing library accessibility for people with physical disabilities, and enhancing the physical space with quiet areas, improved lighting, and meditation spaces.

Social & Personality Psychology Compass,2022,5,"Understanding advantaged groups' opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies: The role of perceived threat.","To combat social inequality, organizations develop and implement initiatives that seek to improve the status of disadvantaged groups (e.g., women, racial/ethnic minority groups). Such diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies are controversial, because people disagree about whether they are necessary and what their (positive and negative) consequences may be. Opposition can be particularly fierce from people who belong to advantaged groups that benefit from the status quo (e.g., men, racial/ethnic majority groups). Given the power wielded by advantaged groups, their opposition can undermine the successful implementation of DEI policies, thus resulting in continued inequality, wasted resources, and potential for tension in the organization. In this paper, I draw on theory and research to consider three types of threat that can explain advantaged groups' opposition to DEI policies: (1) resource threat, or concern about losing access to outcomes and opportunities; (2) symbolic threat, or concern about the introduction of new values, culture, and expectations; and (3) ingroup morality threat, or concern about their group's role in perpetuating inequality. I review strategies identified by the literature to mitigate these threats, and discuss their potential negative consequences. The final section takes stock of the literature and considers directions for future research.","Iyer, Aarti",,"Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"

Summary The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy utilized an organizational approach focused on infrastructure to produce a diverse and inclusive school community. The Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) established vision and mission statements to represent the school's commitment and conducted a comprehensive environmental scan to compose a shared vision. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni participated in a series of retreats, symposiums, and focus groups to identify opportunities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive school community. A working group comprised of key leaders in the school developed and launched a 3-year DEI Strategic Plan along with initiatives and metrics for year 1. The plan's 3 priorities were (1) to recruit and retain diverse talent, (2) to prepare culturally intelligent professionals, and (3) to build an inclusive community. The ODI collaborated with internal and external stakeholders, which included students, faculty, staff, postdocs, alumni, and partners from health systems, industry, and other institutions and organizations, to initiate, implement, and monitor progress through an organizational approach to establish accountability and greater commitment. Conclusion An organizational approach to DEI strategy through stakeholder engagement and infrastructure increased commitment and shared ownership among members of the school community. Applications in an organizational approach can be adapted to multiple healthcare settings to contribute to the cultural transformation necessary to develop a diverse and inclusive healthcare workforce.","White, Carla Y","Patel, Ami","Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion and Division of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy , Chapel Hill, NC, USA"
Journal of Park & Recreation Administration,2022,4,"Bold Moves for Visitor Use Management: Public Health, Public Engagement and Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.","Public land management is inherently complex and requires a systems approach that integrates ecological, economic, and social values. Currently, there are few tools and examples available for federal land management planning that use a systems approach. Issues are often approached from a disciplinary perspective, and outdoor recreation problems, assumptions, and solutions often focus too narrowly on how to mitigate recreation impacts as opposed to understanding the broader role of visitor use and access, public engagement, and public health in sustainable land management. The Visitor Use Management Framework (the Framework), developed by the Interagency Visitor Use Management Council (IVUMC, 2016) provides interagency guidance for managing public use on federal lands and waters. The Framework uses a process that can be incorporated into existing agency planning and decision making. It follows all of the Council agencies' (NPS, BLM, USFS, USFWS, ACoE, NOAA) planning principles and illustrates how to specifically address visitor experiences and resource protection with an integrated planning approach. This research note explores the evolving role of the Framework in sustainable recreation management and how public health, public engagement, and representation, inclusion, and access can be incorporated throughout the Framework to ensure planning decisions meet the needs, values, and preferences of diverse user groups. Further, this paper invites a broader discussion around next steps for boldly moving to integrate public health, public engagement, and representation, inclusion, and access more fully into all aspects of visitor use management, including the Framework. Collective effort and ongoing innovation is needed to ensure that the Framework is thoughtfully implemented in ways that provide opportunities to enhance outdoor recreation access and inclusion for a broader range of people.","Franchina, Rachel","Collins, Rachel","U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region, Golden, CO"

Statement of the Problem: In this article, four former STP Vice Presidents for Diversity and International Relations explore STP's history through the lenses of diversity, equity/social justice, inclusion, and international relations. Literature Review: The paper explores the relevant history of STP and incorporates scholarship of teaching and learning literature through an international and social justice lens. Teaching Implications: The authors discussed ways to support BIPOC and underrepresented instructors of psychology. Conclusion: STP and teachers of psychology play a pivotal role in changing the cultural, structural, and institutional processes representing ongoing barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and social justice within the organization and the teaching of psychology.

"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics",2023,6,"Qualitative Study on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Within Radiation Oncology in Europe.","Organizational culture plays a major role in prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) objectives by aligning individual values of employees with organizational values. However, effective strategies to create an inclusive organizational culture, in which these values are aligned, remain unclear. The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) launched a qualitative study, as a follow-up of the previous project on DEI that highlighted low levels of inclusion and work engagement among radiation oncology (RO) professionals in Europe. The aim of the present study was to gain an understanding of how DEI could be improved within RO departments by creating a more inclusive organizational culture. A qualitative research study was conducted by enrolling RO professionals from 4 selected European countries through an open call on the ESTRO platform. Respondents who completed an online survey and met the inclusion criteria, such as experiencing low DEI levels at work, were invited for an online semistructured interview. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically with an abductive approach via concepts in relation to ""DEI,"" ""work engagement,"" ""organizational culture,"" and ""professional values."" Twenty-six eligible respondents from Great Britain, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland were interviewed. The thematic analysis identified cases in which limited engagement at work emerged when the personal values of RO professionals conflicted with dominant organizational values, hampering DEI. Three conflicts were found between the following personal versus organizational values: (1) self-development versus efficiency, (2) togetherness versus competition, and (3) people-oriented versus task-oriented cultures. Awareness of how organizational values can conflict with professionals' values should be raised to improve inclusion and engagement in the workplace. Additionally, efforts should be focused on tackling existing power imbalances that hamper effective deliberation on organizational- versus personal-value conflicts.","Abravan, Azadeh","Correia, Dora","Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom"

Although most medical schools have a diversity office and associated initiatives, little is known about radiation oncology (RO) department-level efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We describe the current state of DEI leadership and initiatives in RO departments in the US to guide future policies and programs. A total of 124 US RO departments affiliated with a medical school were contacted to identify departmental DEI leadership. Identified DEI leaders were asked to complete an anonymous survey assessing characteristics of their departmental DEI leadership, committee/organizational structure, activities, and perceived barriers to, and effect of, their work. Descriptive statistics are reported. Among 85 RO departments that responded (68.5% response rate), 48 (56.5%) reported having a departmental DEI leader. Thirty-four DEI leaders completed the survey (70.8%). Of those who answered each survey question, most DEI leaders were assistant or associate professors (n = 24, 82.8%), women (n = 19, 73.1%), and identified with at least one non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity (n = 15, 53.6%). Nineteen (57.6%) had an associated departmental DEI committee; with 10 of these starting in 2020 or later. Few DEI leaders had administrative support (38.2%), funding (29.4%), protected time (23.5%), or increased compensation for added duties Fifteen (50.0%) believed their DEI-focused efforts were considered for promotion. The most reported initiatives included offering programming/education, supporting students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, improving recruitment practices/hiring, and implementing pipeline/pathway projects. The perceived impact of DEI initiatives included an increased culture of respect (89.7%), improved health care disparity awareness (75.9%), and improved systemic/structural racism awareness (79.3%). Departmental DEI efforts are increasingly common within RO, however, the structure, resources, and recognition associated with DEI work are variable. Additional dedicated resources and recognition for these efforts will help ensure a culture of inclusive excellence for the RO workforce and patients.","Paradis, Kelly C.","Franco, Idalid","Department of Radiation Oncology, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan"

In his address and its companion essay, Ewell notes how the repertoire we study and teach, as well as the theories we use to explain it, are manifestations of whiteness. My article will show, first, that the repertory used in the development of theories of harmony and form, as well as (and especially) music theory pedagogy comprises a small, unrepresentative corpus of pieces from the so-called ""common practice period"" of tonal music, mostly the music of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and only a small subset of their output. We (mis)use this repertory due to a combination of implicit biases that stem from our enculturation as practicing musicians, explicit biases that stem from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of ""great"" composers and particular ""masterworks,"" and confirmation biases that are manifest in our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when developing and demonstrating our theories. The theories of harmony and form developed from this small corpus further suffer from overfi ing, whereby theoretical models are overdetermined relative to the broader norms of a musical practice, and from our tendency to conceive of our theoretic models in terms of tightly regulated ""scripts"" rather than looser ""plans."" For these reasons, simply expanding our analytic and/or pedagogical canon will do little to displace the underlying aesthetic and cultural values that are bound up with it. We must also address the biases that underlie canon formation and valuation and the methodologies that inherently privilege certain pieces, composers, and repertoires to the detriment of others. It is thus argued that working toward greater equity, diversity, and inclusion in music theory goes hand in hand with addressing some of the problematic methodologies that have long plagued our discipline.","London, Justin",,"Department of Music, Carleton College, Northfield, MN 55057"
Professional Psychology: Research & Practice,2023,2,"Centering Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Ethical Decision-Making.","To provide effective and ethical psychological practice, psychologists must proactively integrate cultural context, as well as equity and justice, in the first and all subsequent steps of ethical decision-making. Extant ethical decision-making models provide substantial support to analyze and respond to ethical dilemmas, but often address culture as only one aspect of making good decisions. This article summarizes the strengths of three representative and current models, as well as limitations in terms of equity, diversity, and inclusion. We proposed a new model, the socially responsive ethical decision-making model that integrates culture and self-awareness throughout. This seven-step model focuses on considering culture immediately at the first step of problem definition, seeking out consultation and information from a wide variety of sources to improve self-reflection and self-awareness, and evaluation alternative solutions from a culturally curious and culturally humble perspective. We offer vignettes to demonstrate how to apply such a model, in both clinical and research situations. The article concludes with a brief commentary on the value of engaging in socially responsive decision-making when facing an ethical dilemma. Public Significance Statement: This article presents a model of socially responsive ethical decision-making, which integrates cultural humility and cultural competence into the ethical decision-making required of health service psychologists. Providing both the steps of the model and application of those steps through two vignettes, this article challenges psychologists to integrate self-reflection, cultural awareness, and socially responsive analysis into each step of responding to an ethical dilemma.","Juntunen, Cindy L.","Crepeau-Hobson, Franci","College of Education and Human Development, University of North Dakota"

Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education,2023,4,"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice in Water Dialogues: A Review and Conceptualization.","In the United States, the lack of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in water governance and management has been identified as a serious problem that affects the validity of decisions. Because water governance and management institutions, processes, and practices at all scales involve dialogue, it is important to understand DEIJ in water dialogues. This paper reports on the results of a systematic literature survey that was undertaken to guide efforts by The University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center to improve diversity and inclusion in its engagement practices and outreach strategies. Three questions are explored: 1) How is DEIJ defined, conceptualized, and measured in water dialogues?, 2) How does a lack of DEIJ in water dialogues affect water‐related outcomes and actors?, and 3) What are the approaches that can be used to increase DEIJ in water dialogues, especially with respect to underrepresented groups? The review synthesizes definitions of DEIJ and examines theories and methods from the literatures on discourse, diversity, social learning, and environmental justice. The lens of dialogue focused these disparate literatures on how people with diverse voices can be engaged and enabled to effectively participate in water dialogues. Despite the paucity of DEIJ literature relating to water resources in general, and to water dialogues more specifically, the review identified characteristics of DEIJ, factors that contribute to DEIJ issues, general lessons, and pathways that apply to increasing DEIJ in water dialogue participation. Further, this paper articulates a conceptual framework for understanding and addressing DEIJ failures in water dialogues. A concept of ""just water dialogues"" emerged that integrates insights from the literature reviewed with notions of environmental justice to help with identifying and resolving ""water dialogue justice"" (i.e., DEIJ failures). Review results suggest that DEIJ in water resources dialogues depends on the distribution of knowledge resources, and on broader issues that include cultural, political, and other often ignored contextual factors. Importantly, addressing DEIJ problems through the creation and maintenance of just water dialogues requires tackling power imbalances, enhancing individual and organizational capacity, and building bridges through effective engagement of diverse voices, especially those of underrepresented groups. Strategies that have demonstrated effectiveness in other contexts are highlighted, and future research needed to improve practices to enhance DEIJ in water dialogues is outlined.","Williams, Simone A.","Eden, Susanna","University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center, Tucson Arizona"

Data Source: We administered the HSPR Workplace Culture Survey online to health services and policy researchers. Study Design: Our survey examined participants' sociodemographic, educational, and professional backgrounds, their perception on DEI in HSPR, experience with DEI initiatives, feeling of inclusion, and direct and witnessed experiences of discrimination at their institutions/organizations. We calculated sample proportions of responses by gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability status and compared them with Fisher's exact test. Data Collection: We administered the survey online from July 28 to September 4, 2020. HSPR professionals and trainees aged 18 and older were eligible to participate. Analyses used complete cases only (n = 906; 70.6% completion rate). Principal Findings: 53.4% of the participants did not believe that the current workforce reflects the diversity of communities impacted by HSPR. Although most participants have witnessed various DEI initiatives at their institutions/organizations, nearly 40% characterized these initiatives as ""tokenistic."" Larger proportions of participants who identified as female, LGBQI+, underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, and those with a disability held this perception than their male, heterosexual, White, and non‐disabled counterparts. Current DEI initiatives focused on ""planning"" activities (e.g., convening task forces) rather than ""implementation"" activities (e.g., establishing mentoring or network programs). 43.7% of the participants felt supported on their career development, while female, Black, Hispanic/Latino, LGBQI+ participants and those with a disability experienced discrimination at their workplace.

One means by which to rectify these long-standing inequities is through the implementation of a position dedicated to DEI among journal editorial boards; thus, we sought to assess the extent to which this position has been implemented among high-impact biomedical research journals. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the editorial boards of the top 100 journals by impact factor (IF) across 30 medical specialties. All editorial board positions (editors-in-chief, deputy, associate, and assistant editors, as well as editorial and advisory board members) were included. We also assessed the proportion of other named-position editors (i.e. social media and statistics editors), and compared these to the proportion of DEI editors. Among the 100 highest IF biomedical journals (range: 12.035–508.702), 6 (6%) have a DEI editorial position. In contrast, 25 (25%) and 35 (35%) journals have at least 1 social media or statistics editorial position, respectively.

We explore what curriculum means in physics, how power relationships within the university affect the response to top-down change, and ultimately who has control over the curriculum. We find that the different conceptualisations of curriculum in physics compared to educational research mean that a directed top-down approach stalls when concepts that fall outside of the physics curriculum, such as EDI, are introduced. Nevertheless, initiatives that are in response to EDI concerns that would be considered to be curriculum change from an educational research perspective are enacted within the department on a localised scale.

Survey respondents and Town Hall participants provided valuable observations and synthesis on the past, present, and future of JEDI work in ocean sciences. Discussion included both positive efforts and outcomes of JEDI work as well as harmful and ineffective practices. This paper synthesizes feedback received and highlights ways in which the ocean sciences community and professional and scientific societies can advance similar work. Gatekeeping, a system of implicit or explicit cultural and institutional constraints to and requirements for entry into a field, was identified as the most significant challenge to diversifying the ocean sciences. The majority of survey respondents agreed that efforts to broaden participation have been successful, and identified specific initiatives that have been effective, including the development and support of mentorship and training programs and partnerships with minority-serving institutions. Some challenges to advancing JEDI initiatives include targeted recruitment from the most ""elite"" institutions and ""parachute science."" Respondents agreed that professional and scientific societies have an important role to play in advancing JEDI in ocean sciences. Participants discussed strategies to broaden participation, including efforts that can be employed by professional and scientific societies such as regular data collection on demographics, improved information sharing, and stricter codes of conduct at professional meetings. We conclude by summarizing some new TOS-led initiatives that are designed to promote JEDI in ocean sciences and beyond.","Meyer-Gutbrod, Erin L.","Pierson, James J.","Assistant Professor, School of the Earth, Ocean and Environment, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"
Multicultural Perspectives,2022,1,"The Impact of Racial Socialization on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Facilitation: A Critical Collaborative Autoethnography Among Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Teacher-Educators.","This critical collaborative autoethnography critically examines how three women (Black, Asian American, and white) teacher educators negotiated their roles as diversity, equity, and inclusion facilitators for a national alternative educator preparation program. A major category that emerged from the research was how our racialized experiences impacted our work as DEI facilitators. Our reliance on individual experiences and identities shaped by race created a narrow vision of DEI development. This work adds to the limited literature around the experiences of DEI facilitators in alternative educator preparation programs and the personal nature of the professional role. The research considers future implications for teacher preparation programs in their recruitment and training of teacher educators.","Nam, Rosa","Lenderman, Kristian",Clark University
Anesthesia: Essays & Researches,2022,4,"Spinal, epidural, and general anesthesia for knee joint arthroscopy: Diversity, equity, and inclusion – Comparison study.","Background: Knee arthroscopic surgery is a commonly performed procedure for diagnosing and treating knee joint problems. This procedure can be achieved under various types of anesthesia, general; or by applying regional anesthesia or even local. Epidural anesthesia and peripheral nerve blockage have been utilized in short procedures and provided a shorter length of hospital stay than general anesthesia in many former articles; however, spinal anesthesia including bupivacaine infusion has also offered a shorter length of hospital stay compared to general anesthesia. While the literature has not compared optimal techniques for these valid options. Aims: This review was conducted to challenge the hypothesis: What would be of choice for local anesthesia agents (either epidural or spinal anesthesia) that would be comparable to short-acting general anesthesia agents in terms of patient satisfaction and discharge times?! Setting and Design: The review was conducted as a prospective, randomized study. Patients were randomized using a sealed envelope method to be selected to one anesthesia technique (general, epidural, or spinal anesthesia). Materials and Methods: During the period between January 2019 and December 2020, 198 patients underwent unilateral knee joint arthroscopy. Seventy-seven patients refused anesthesia randomization and opted for one option directly. One hundred and twenty-one patients were qualified for the final recruitment stage of this analysis to contribute to the anesthesia randomization and they were assigned into three groups. Results: Demographical analysis showed no significant differences between cohorts. No major surgical or anesthetic adverse effects were reported. Anesthesia reported satisfactory for incision among three groups. For regional anesthesia cohorts, sphincteric control (voiding) considered a mandatory parameter for discharge, was shorter in the epidural group compared to the spinal anesthesia cohort (154 ± 28 vs. 189 ± 47 min, P < 0.0013). Time to discharge for the three cohorts was also significantly shorter for general anesthesia and epidural cohorts as compared to spinal cohort (general, 106 ± 29 min; epidural, 90 ± 18 min; spinal, 151 ± 48 min, P < 0.003). A total of 114 patients stated that they would select the same anesthetic method over again. Conclusion: This review revealed that regional epidural anesthesia using 2-chloroprocaine and general anesthesia using short-acting agents were similarly successful in terms of perioperative conditions and duration of hospital stay in our center. Whereas spinal anesthesia using 10 mg of bupivacaine combined with fentanyl in the same setting lacked behind in terms of extended discharge time and showed a higher prevalence of adverse effects.","Wesam, Khresat","Jraisat, Ibrahim","Department of Anesthesia, King Hussein Medical Center, Royal Medical Services, Amman"

Pediatric Anesthesia,2023,6,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia: A mixed methods assessment.","Background: Leadership of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia created the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee in 2018 to prioritize diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia‐Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee implemented a baseline survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership in 2020 to assess demographics, equity in leadership, inclusivity, and attitudes toward diversity work. The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia plays a significant role in shaping the future of pediatric anesthesiology and in supporting our diverse pediatric patients. Methods: This study is an IRB‐exempt, cross‐sectional survey of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership. Quantitative analysis provided descriptive statistics of demographics, practice characteristics, and involvement within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. Qualitative thematic analysis provided an in‐depth assessment of perceptions of diversity, challenges faced, and prioritization of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. Results: Out of 3 242 Society for Pediatric Anesthesia members, 1 232 completed the survey representing 38% of overall membership. Respondents were 89.2% United States members, 52.7% female, 55.7% non‐Hispanic White, 88.6% heterosexual, 95.7% non‐military, 59.2% religious, and 2.1% have an Americans with Disabilities Act recognized disability. All major United States geographical areas were represented equally with 71% practicing in urban areas and 67% in academic settings. Ethnic/racial minorities were more likely to be international medical graduates (p <.001). Among United States members, 41.5% report being fluent in a language other than English, and 23.5% of those fluent in another language are certified to interpret. Compared to men, women are less likely to be in leadership roles (p <.003), but we found no difference in participation and leadership when stratified by race/ethnicity, geography, international medical graduate status, or sexuality. Racial/ethnic minorities (p <.028), women (p <.001), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer members (p <.044) more frequently hold lower academic rank positions when compared to white, heterosexual, and male members. Half of respondents were unsure whether diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges existed within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia while the other half demonstrated opposing views. Among those who reported diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges, the themes centered around persistent marginalization, the need for more inclusive policies and increased psychological safety, and lack of leadership diversity. Conclusions: Compared to the diversity of the pediatric population we serve, there are still significant gaps in demographic representation within the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia. As well, there is no consensus among Society for Pediatric Anesthesia membership regarding perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in pediatric anesthesia in the United States. Among those who reported diversity challenges, opportunities for the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and Anesthesiology Departments to better support minoritized members included bolstering workforce diversity efforts and awareness via more inclusive policies, improved psychological safety, and increasing diversity in leadership. If pediatric anesthesiology is like other specialties, gaining consensus and improving diversity in the workforce might advance pediatric anesthesia innovation, quality, and safety for children of all backgrounds in the United States.","Reece‐Nguyen, Travis L.","Lee, Helen H.","Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford California,, USA"

A 23-item survey was developed by the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee resident members and faculty advisors. The survey was divided into 4 sections: institutional culture, support and resources, interview and recruitment, and experiences of bias. The survey was sent individually to residents from all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–accredited radiation oncology programs. The survey was issued to 757 residents. A total of 319 residents completed the survey, for a response rate of 42%. All postgraduate years and geographic regions were represented. Significant racial, ethnic, and gender differences were present in survey response patterns. White residents (94%, 164 of 174) and male residents (96%, 186 of 194) were more likely to strongly agree/agree that they were treated with respect by their colleagues and their coworkers than other racial groups (P <.005) or gender groups (P <.008). Only 3% (5 of 174) of White residents strongly agreed/agreed that they were treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity, while 31% (5 of 16) of Black residents and 10% (9 of 94) of Asian residents strongly agreed/agreed (P <.0001). Similarly, Hispanic residents were more likely to strongly agree/agree (24%, 5 of 21) than non-Hispanic residents (7%, 20 of 298) (P =.003). Regarding mentorship, there were no differences by gender or ethnicity. There were differences by race in residents reporting that they had a supportive mentor (P =.022), with 89% (154 of 174) of White residents who strongly agreed/agreed, 88% (14 of 16) of Black residents, and 91% of Asian residents (86 of 94). This survey reveals that experiences of support, mentorship, inclusion, and bias vary significantly among radiation oncology residents based on race, ethnicity, and gender. Radiation oncology has opportunity for growth to ensure an equitable experience for all residents.","Williams, Vonetta M.","Franco, Idalid","Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York"

A 28-item survey was developed using the validated Ethnic Harassment Experiences Scale and the Daily Life Experiences subscale, as well as input from DEI leaders in RO. The survey was institutional review board–approved and administered to RO PDs. PDs were provided with the American Association of Medical Colleges definition of UIM, that is, ""Underrepresented in medicine means those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population."" Descriptive statistics were used in analysis. The response rate was 71% (64/90). Institutional Culture and Beliefs: 42% responded that they had a department DEI director. A minority (17%, n = 11) agreed ""I believe that people from UIM backgrounds have equal access to quality tertiary education in the US."" The majority (97%, n = 62) agreed ""My program values residents from UIM backgrounds."" Support and Resources: The majority (78%, n = 50) agreed ""My program has resources in place to assist/provide support for resident physicians from UIM backgrounds."" Interview and Recruitment: Most PDs (53%) had not taken part in activities aimed at recruiting UIM residents and 17% had interviewed no UIM applicants in the past 5 years for residency. Resident Experiences of Racism: 17% (n = 11) agreed ""UIM residents in my program have reported incidents of racism to me,"" and 28% (n = 18) agreed ""I believe that UIM residents in my program have been treated differently because of their race/ethnicity by faculty, staff, coresidents or patients."" Most PDs reported that they did not believe that UIM residents were treated differently in their department because of their race/ethnicity, and only a minority had received reports of racial discrimination experienced by residents. These data contrast resident experiences and suggest a disconnect between DEI perceptions and resident experiences among US RO PDs that should be addressed through increased programmatic action and evaluation.","Williams, Vonetta M.","Franco, Idalid","Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York"

The membership's experiences of inclusion, belonging, professional opportunities, discrimination, microaggressions, racism, and harassment in their professional lives are presented. The ethics-reviewed survey was distributed in English and French to full members of COMP. Participants responded to questions covering demographics and professional climate. Simple descriptive statistics were used to measure frequency of responses. Data pertaining to impressions on the climate within the profession were compared using nonparametric statistical tests. The survey was distributed to 649 eligible members; 243 (37%) responded, and 214 (33%) provided full response sets. From the full response sets, findings showed that in general, age, highest academic degree, and racial and ethnic distribution trends of medical physicists were comparable with previously collected data and/or the Canadian population. The experiences of respondents relating to harassment in the workplace and perception of climate are reported and provide a useful benchmark for future assessments of interventions or training programs. In the workplace, fewer women (58%) reported having professional opportunities compared with men (70%). The survey also found that 17% of respondents (most of whom were women) directly or indirectly experienced sexual harassment in the workplace within the past 5 years. Finding that 23% of survey respondents identified as having a disability is a valuable reminder that accommodations in the workplace are necessary for more than 1 in every 5 medical physicists working in clinics. This study provided insight into the diversity and experiences of medical physicists in Canada. The majority of respondents had positive perceptions about their professional environment. However, equity-lacking groups were identified, such as women, underrepresented minorities, Indigenous peoples, and people with visible and invisible disabilities.","Aldosary, Ghada","Koo, Meghan","Department of Radiation Medicine, Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"

The climate survey targeted medical physicists who are full members of the AAPM and included demographic inquiries and questions intended to assess the working environmental climate in terms of a sense of belonging and inclusion, experiences of discrimination and harassment, and obstacles to participation within the AAPM. The survey invitation was sent to 5,500 members. Responses were collected from 1385 members (response rate of 25%) between January and February 2021. Overall, the medical physics workplace climate was positive. However, some demographic and professional subgroups reported lower levels of agreement with positive characteristics of their workplace climates. Compared with men, women ranked lower 7 of 8 categories that characterized the workplace climate. Other subgroups that also ranked the workplace climate descriptors lower included individuals not originally from the United States and Canada (3/8). Most respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the climate within the AAPM was welcoming. However, 17% of respondents reported personally experiencing or witnessing microaggressions within the AAPM. Overall, medical physicists reported low levels of agreement that opportunities within the AAPM were available to them, from 34% to 60% among 8 categories, including opportunities to volunteer, join committees, and compete for leadership positions within the AAPM. Several subgroups reported even lower levels of agreement that these opportunities are available. Asian and Asian American respondents (3/8) and physicists with origins in countries outside the United States and Canada (7/8) reported fewer opportunities to participate in the AAPM. Medical physicists reported their experiences of discrimination and sexual harassment in their workplaces and within the AAPM. For those who reported personal experiences of sexual harassment, only 24% (15/63) felt comfortable reporting when it occurred within their workplaces, and 35% (9/26) felt comfortable reporting when it occurred within the AAPM. The report concludes with several recommendations for action.","Hendrickson, Kristi R.G.","Avery, Stephen M.","Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington"
Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine,2021,9,"Strategies to Enhance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Pathology Training Programs: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.","* Context.--Like many medical specialties, pathology faces the ongoing challenge of effectively enriching diversity, equity, and inclusion within training programs and the field as a whole. This issue is furthered by a decline in US medical student interest in the field of pathology, possibly attributable to increasingly limited pathology exposure during medical school and medical student perceptions about careers in pathology. Objective.--To review the literature to identify the challenges to diversity, equity, and inclusion in pathology, with an emphasis on the pathology trainee pipeline. To evaluate the medical education literature from other medical specialties for diversity and inclusion--focused studies and initiatives, and determine the outcomes and/or approaches relevant for pathology training programs. Data Sources.--A literature review was completed by a search of the PubMed database, as well as a similar general Google search. Additional resources, including the Web sites of the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Electronic Residency Application Service, and the National Resident Matching Program, were used. Conclusions.--Many strategies exist to increase diversity and encourage an inclusive and equitable training environment, and many of these strategies may be applied to the field of pathology. Interventions such as increasing exposure to the field, using a holistic application review process, and addressing implicit biases have been shown to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in many medical specialties. In addition, increasing access to elective and pipeline programs may help to bolster medical student interest in careers in pathology.","Ware, Alisha D.","Washington Flax, Lauren","Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland"

Because bibliometrics is a powerful tool to reveal the scientific literature on a specific topic during a certain timespan, a systematic bibliometric analysis of the documents published on EDI in radiation oncology was performed, aiming at exploring common patterns in research and emerging trends, tracking collaborations and networks, and anticipating future directions in clinical research. Standard descriptive statistics and bibliometric techniques were used in the analysis. A collaboration network and thematic map were generated from the data. Four domains were represented: (1) motor themes, including themes well developed and important for the structuring of the research field; (2) niche themes, representing the isolated topics that do not share important external links with other themes; (3) emerging themes, referring to still weakly developed topics; and (4) basic themes, including the essential topics. EDI in the profession of radiation oncology is essential to ensure that the workforce delivering radiation oncology care both draws from the full talent pool of human capital and delivers the highest quality science and clinical care to all patients. The burgeoning literature on EDI in radiation oncology suggests that a large and growing cohort of scholars within radiation oncology are dedicated to addressing these important challenges.","Franco, Pierfrancesco","De Felice, Francesca","Department of Translational Medicine (DIMET), University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy"

This paper focuses on the experiences of academics engaging in such work, particularly in their roles as educators, by sharing two of the authors' experiences introducing equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in a first‐year science course at a Canadian university. Using critical research methodologies like narrative inquiry and memory work, we look at three separate instances where complex personal, institutional and course attributes fostered, allowed, or hindered efforts to bring these initiatives into the classroom. We consider how problematic incidents and obstacles relating to the organization of content on equity, diversity, and inclusion in science cropped up during the process, how they were perceived and handled in the moment, as well as the authors' reflections, takeaways, and lessons learned from the experience. These stories suggest that efforts to center discussions about equity, diversity, and inclusion in undergraduate science classrooms can be unpredictable and complex, particularly at the day‐to‐day level; this is especially the case when handling subtler microaggressions rather than clear instances of discrimination or harassment. Our study points to the importance of creating a more permanent institutional memory for initiatives that outlive those who initiated and organized them, so that they become embedded within the culture of a course or department.","Ramachandran, Aishwarya","Mouat, Isobel C.","School of Kinesiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver British Columbia,, Canada"

American Journal of Gastroenterology (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins),2022,12,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Gastroenterology and Hepatology: A Survey of Where We Stand.","INTRODUCTION: In the setting of increasing attention to representation in medicine, we aimed to assess current perspectives of racial and ethnic workforce diversity and health care disparities among gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology professionals in the United States. METHODS: We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity. RESULTS: Of the 1,219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]). Suggested interventions were to increase career mentorship opportunities (n = 545 [44.7%]), medical student opportunities (n = 520 [42.7%]), and program and professional society leadership roles for underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups (n = 473 [38.8%]). DISCUSSION: Our survey explored imperative and timely perspectives on racial and ethnic representation and health equity among professionals in GI and hepatology. The findings should inform future interventions to address workforce diversity and establish priorities toward improving health equity, ultimately serving as a springboard for professional societies, academic institutions, and other organizations that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field.","Rahal, Harman K.","Tabibian, James H.","Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California–Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA"

We conducted a content analysis on the first 6 website images and 3-elements of DPD (n = 212) websites (mission statement, goals and objectives, and the immediate landing page). Descriptive statistics and a website DEI score were calculated. Equity and inclusion-related terms appeared on < 5% of websites. Diversity and culture-related terms appeared on about one-third of websites. On average, researchers perceived 28.45% of people in website images as non-White, and 20.11% as non-female. Most websites received low DEI scores. The DPD websites had a limited representation of DEI-related terms and image representation of individuals perceived to be non-female and non-White.

International Journal of Cross Cultural Management,2022,12,"Performing in diverse settings: A diversity, equity, and inclusion approach to culture.","Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are being built into the fabric of today's organizations, and utilizing such a lens is vital to understanding cross-cultural performance. Yet, most of the culture and diversity literature has grown in silos and is therefore not leveraging the many benefits that their integration could provide. To counter this gap, we advance a theoretical framework featuring a new definition of cross-cultural performance (CCP) from a DEI perspective, as a new angle for doing work across cultures. Specifically, CCP is defined as the integration of multiple cultural perspectives of individuals who work together with the goal of enabling a diverse, inclusive, and equitable work environment. By applying the DEI lens to CCP, we elevate the meaning of performance due to added consideration of compositional differences, the possible barriers to employees' success, and the extent to which others' perspectives are indeed valued. Accordingly, our framework identifies three main components of CCP: catalyzing cultural differences, taking part in engaging communication, and promoting allyship activities. Furthermore, we specify emotional management as the glue of these three components, and key outcomes at different levels of analysis. Last, we discuss the implications of our framework to both theory and practice as well as directions for future research.","Feitosa, Jennifer","Hagenbuch, Spencer","2530 Claremont McKenna College, USA"

This may partially explain why many psychology departments do not offer undergraduate courses that focus on the unique perspectives of specific ethnic groups. Objective: This study offers practical suggestions for instructors in promoting inclusivity within the classroom detailed though perceptions of students. Method: Focus groups were conducted with 27 students within four ethnic-specific courses. Focus groups were divided into comparison groups: 1) those that ethnically matched the course material and 2) those that did not. Results: Ethnic-specific coursework provides space to address systemic issues. Implications from ethnic matching, inclusion efforts within the classroom, and building a class community are discussed. Conclusions: Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are supported when departments offer ethnic-specific courses. The trust and communication with students are improved by constructing effective course frameworks. Teaching Implications: We inform the development and implementation of ethnic-specific psychology courses by highlighting practical considerations for instructors of varying ethnic backgrounds. Instructors from varied backgrounds can effectively teach these courses but having applied experiences and research related to specific ethnic groups is essential in developing trust and communication with students.","Arellanes, Jordan A.","Hendricks, Michael","Department of Psychology, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA"

International Journal for Equity in Health,2022,12,"Intersectionality, health equity, and EDI: What's the difference for health researchers?","Many countries adopted comprehensive national initiatives to promote equity in higher education with the goal of transforming the culture of research. Major health research funders are supporting this work through calls for projects that focus on equity, resulting in a proliferation of theoretical frameworks including ""intersectionality,"" ""health equity,"" and variations of equity, diversity and inclusion, or EDI. This commentary is geared at individual principal investigators and health research teams who are developing research proposals and want to consider equity issues in their research, perhaps for the first time. We present histories and definitions of three commonly used frameworks: intersectionality, health equity, and EDI. In the context of health research, intersectionality is a methodology (a combination of epistemology and techniques) that can identify the relationships among individual identities and systems of oppression; however, it should also be used internally by research teams to reflect on the production of knowledge. Health equity is a societal goal that operationalizes the social determinants of health to document and address health disparities at the population level. EDI initiatives measure and track progress within organizations or teams and are best suited to inform the infrastructure and human resourcing ""behind the scenes"" of a project. We encourage researchers to consider these definitions and strive to tangibly move health research towards equity both in the topics we study and in the ways we do research.","Kelly, Christine","Dansereau, Lisette","Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"

A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was done using data from the American Association of Medical Colleges. The distribution of gender and race, academic ranks, tenure tracks, and degrees was reported. The total number of otolaryngologists increased from 1,490 to 2,239, where 53 percent were females. All races experienced an increase; however, Whites and Asians had a greater increase compared to Black and Hispanics. Regarding percentages at different ranks, White were the majority (>50 percent) in every category. As for tenure, the general trend was a decrease in the total number of tenured physicians from 327 in 2007 to 318 in 2018, where Black, Hispanic, and Asian tenured physicians increased, while White tenured physicians decreased. White male otolaryngologists were the majority for every subgroup (>60 percent), whereas Black faculty made up less than 1 percent of tenured category. Female representation gradually increased for all levels of tenure. As for all degrees, Whites were the majority for all levels of education (>60 percent). There were some improvements in the representations for the females in all and Asians on the tenure track.

Our purpose is twofold: (i) to provide a thorough description of the curriculum redesign process for an undergraduate kinesiology and health promotion (KHP) program, and (ii) to use our experience to provide more general recommendations to other departments and universities undergoing curricular redesign. The catalyst for this redesign was the conversion from a quarter-system to a semester-system and the opportunities for improvement identified through that process. The redesign was guided by a newly created departmental strategic plan, faculty professional development trainings, student feedback, faculty hirings and their areas of expertise, and industry demands. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was mindfully embedded into the curriculum to reflect the department-, college-, and university-level core value of inclusivity. The redesign allows prospective KHP students to complete several courses that address DEI themes, in addition to the courses that build their technical competencies. Providing foundational exposure to DEI concepts through the undergraduate curriculum can better prepare students to work in diverse settings. As such, this report provides other programs with a framework to follow to make curriculum more DEI centric for their students.","Lewis, Zakkoyya H.","Hansen, Ken","Kinesiology and Health Promotion Department, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA 91768, USA"

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the medical workforce is linked to improved patient care and innovation, as well as employee retention and engagement. The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology launched a survey to provide a benchmark of DEI and engagement among radiation oncology (RO) professionals in Europe. An anonymous survey was disseminated among RO professionals in Europe. The survey collected demographics and professional information, and participants were asked if they felt they belonged to a minority group. A DEI and workforce engagement questionnaire by Person et al. evaluated 8 inclusion factors. A favourable score was calculated by adding the percentage of ""strongly agreed"" or ""agreed"" answers. A total of 812 complete responses were received from 35 European countries. 21% of respondents felt they belonged to a minority group, mostly based on race/ethnicity (5.9%), nationality (4.8%) and age (4.3%). Compared to benchmark data from the United States, scores were lower for most inclusion factors, and to a greater extent for minority groups. The overall favourable score was 58% for those belonging to a minority group, significantly lower than for other respondents (71%, p < 0.001). Those belonging to a minority group because of their gender or age had the lowest overall favourable score (47% and 51% respectively). Our work indicates that actions to improve DEI and workforce engagement among RO professionals in Europe are urgently needed, in particular among minority groups. This would potentially improve employee wellbeing and retention, promoting high quality care and innovation.","Gasnier, Anne","Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja","Radiotherapy Department, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France"

A radiology department's online presence and use of gender-inclusive language are essential in promoting an environment of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). The naming of radiology fellowships and continuing medical education (CME) courses with terminology such as ""Women's Imaging"" indicates a lack of inclusivity to TGNB patients and providers, which could result in suboptimal patient care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all institutions in Canada and the United States (US) offering training in Breast Imaging, Women's Imaging, or Breast and Body Imaging. Data was collected from each institution's radiology department website pertaining to fellowship names, EDI involvement, and CME courses. Results: 8 Canadian and 71 US radiology fellowships were identified. 75% of Canadian and 90% of US fellowships had gender-inclusive names. One (12.5%) Canadian and 29 (41%) US institutions had EDI Committees mentioned on their websites. Among institutions publicly displaying CME courses about breast/body or women's imaging, gender-inclusive names were used in only 1 (25%) of the Canadian CME courses, compared to 81% of the US institutions. Conclusions: Most institutions in Canada and the US have gender-inclusive names for their radiology fellowships pertaining to breast and body imaging. However, there is much opportunity to and arguably the responsibility for institutions in both countries to increase the impact and visibility of their EDI efforts through creation of department-specific committees and CME courses.","Yan, Tyler D.","Mak, Lauren E.","Faculty of Medicine, 12358 University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"

Additionally, several resources were reported to have the potential to improve EDI, but their effectiveness and feasibility are yet to be determined. In this commentary we suggest six approaches, based on the Royal Society of Chemistry set of requirements, that journals could implement to improve EDI. They are: (1) adopt a journal EDI statement with clear, actionable steps to achieve it; (2) promote the use of inclusive and bias-free language; (3) appoint a journal's EDI director or lead; (4) establish a EDI mentoring approach; (5) monitor adherence to EDI principles; and (6) publish reports on EDI actions and achievements.

Emerging research has turned toward pedagogy as an interventional strategy for educating on issues of racial justice and inclusion. About the case: This teaching case presents the transformation of a TPC service course to specifically address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In response to the racial injustice documented during the summer of 2020, I developed a sequence of assignments that asked students to research and apply DEI initiatives. The assignment was to research and write a short report on DEI approaches in the workplace, followed by a larger team-based project in which students worked with the local city council to enact possible DEI initiatives in the broader community. Methods: The case was studied through the author's experience and the analysis of data obtained from surveys with class participants and other instructors who incorporated the assignments in their courses. Results/discussion: Students were able to learn more about how to address bias, inclusion, and social justice in a business environment, but also demonstrated some implicit resistance to direct attention to racial injustice.

Journal of the American Planning Association,2022,4,"Our Diversity Is Our Strength: Explaining Variation in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Emphasis in Municipal Arts and Cultural Plans.","Municipal arts and cultural plans direct significant amounts of public investment and set far-reaching policies, as arts and culture investment becomes an increasingly widespread economic development strategy. Though these plans frequently advertise the city's diversity, they often lack specific strategies for supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In addition, the creation of these plans often does not involve urban planners, nor do the plans often connect to the city's comprehensive plan or contain the types of fact bases and commitments to equity that comprehensive plans do. In this study of 64 U.S. municipal arts and cultural plans, we investigated what kinds of cities are producing arts and cultural plans that do a better job of integrating concepts of DEI and what factors can explain these differences. We also investigated which specific policies were present that addressed DEI in arts and cultural plans. We found that newer plans more strongly emphasized equity, and plans with more robust public processes and those in more diverse cities more strongly emphasized equity and DEI overall, whereas plans in cities with lower median household incomes more strongly emphasized equity and inclusion. Overall, plans were much more likely to talk about diversity and inclusion than the specifics of equitable distribution of arts and cultural resources. Planners need to get involved in arts and cultural planning to ensure that planning processes for arts and cultural plans work to achieve the same standards we expect for comprehensive plans. They must be based on inclusive processes, understand the range of diversity of people in the city, and commit to specific, targeted place-based and people-based public investment to improve equity. Planners can also expand their typical approaches through alignments with topical arts and cultural plans.","Loh, Carolyn G.","Ashley, Amanda J.",

Perspectives: Policy & Practice in Higher Education,2021,4,Equity education initiatives within Canadian universities: promise and limits.,"A multitude of forces are driving Canadian universities, as well as many other institutions across the country, to enhance equity, diversity, and inclusion ('EDI'). All organisations instinctively turn to educational initiatives to instil and promote EDI. The value of EDI education, notably training about unconscious bias and how to mitigate its adverse impacts, has received considerable academic attention and the promise and drawbacks of EDI education, in general, are well-documented. Yet the value of EDI education for universities, especially in Canada, has not before been subject to scholarly assessment. This essay undertakes an analysis of EDI education within universities, examining its potential to stimulate organisational change and render postsecondary institutions more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. The essay further examines the limitations and potential of EDI education, and presents the conditions under which it stands to make the most significant contributions to EDI in the contemporary Canadian university context.","Campbell, Angela",,"Associate Provost (Equity & Academic Policies), McGill University, Montreal, Canada"

After finalizing a draft, a pilot implementation of the milestones was conducted by a convenience sample of 10 AFMRD DHE Task Force members for their own programs. Scores varied widely across surveyed programs for all milestones. Highest average scores were seen for the Curriculum milestone (2.65) and the lowest for the Faculty Personnel milestone (2.0). Milestone assessments were completed within 10 to 40 minutes using various methods.

Nationally, increases in female residents were noted from 38.0 to 46.0% (P < .001) and in Hispanic or Latinx residents from 7.3 to 8.3% (P = .031). Across geographic regions, a significant increase in female residents was noted in the Northwest (51.9 to 58.3%, P = .039), Midwest (36.9 to 43.3%, P = .006), and Southwest (35.8 to 47.5%, P = .027). A significant increase in black residents was only noted in the Northwest (0 to 15.8%, P = .031). The proportion of white residents decreased nationally by 8.9% and in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Southwest between 5.5 and 15.9% (P < .05).<bold>Discussion: </bold>In an increasingly diverse society, expanding the numbers of underrepresented surgeons in training, and ultimately in practice, is a necessity. This study shows that there are region-specific increases in diversity, despite minimal change on a national level.

Oncology Nursing Forum,2022,3,"DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION.","In an outpatient ambulatory healthcare setting, the desire to cultivate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion principles among the healthcare team was initiated by Diversity Champions. In 2020 as diversity and race relations in the United States were brought to the forefront by media outlets, the Diversity Champions desired to have open dialogue among team members to better understand our colleagues and the patients we serve. A group of seven Diversity Champion members from the ambulatory healthcare building joined forces to receive extensive training and provide a forum for exploring cultural diversity, equity and inclusion on our campus. The purpose of this project was to create a Diversity Poster Fair to celebrate our diverse workforce and build cultural awareness among team members: (a) Promote Cultural Awareness. (b) Create healthy work environment. (c) Provide Innovative ideas to advance inclusion. (d) Present education. (e) Increase awareness of team dynamics with honest self-reflection on personal beliefs and unconscious bias. Identifying how unconscious bias impacts others. (f) Learn from other perspectives. Diversity Champions met monthly to develop a timeline, discuss objectives, and delegate assigned task to assure success of the Diversity Fair. Additionally, discussion at meetings included networking, exploring feelings and thoughts on courses attended. Sharing cultural beliefs and providing a platform to grow as Diversity Champions for the campus. Individuals and groups of interdisciplinary members submitted posters addressing topics of education, cultural awareness or innovative ideas to advance inclusion. Ninety eight percent of staff members surveyed indicated the poster fair increased awareness of diversity resources available to them as employees. Ninety Five percent of team members indicated they gained knowledge that could improve their customer interactions. Eighty percent of team members surveyed responded that the fair promoted open conversations between colleagues. All team members indicated the poster fair increased their awareness of diversity networks available to them. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Poster Fair allowed team members to work individually and in groups to research and create educational posters regarding a variety of diverse topics which fostered learning.

There is a need for an intersectionality framework that is inclusive of both the local and global diversity of researchers. Here, we present an intersectionality framework called KLOB which structures barriers to academic success into four components: knowledge exchange (K), language (L), obligations (O), and biases (B), and thus helps to think about the cumulative effect of multiple barriers that individuals from different backgrounds encounter to succeed in academic activities such as scientific publishing, which is the primary currency of academic success in our current system. This framework highlights both local and global disparities in socioeconomic, linguistic, and discriminatory factors that determine the opportunity of individual researchers to succeed in academia. We emphasise that individual researchers have no control over most barriers they face because of where and how they were born. Implementing solutions to address barriers associated with KLOB requires a multiscale vision and initiatives that tackle local and global inequities.","Khelifa, Rassim","Mahdjoub, Hayat","Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, University of British Columbia, Vancouver British Columbia,, Canada"

International Journal of Inclusive Education,2021,12,"Feeling excluded: international students experience equity, diversity and inclusion.","Many institutions of higher education have committed to the principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). This collective move signifies an effort to identify and confront systemic issues of marginalisation and exclusion of minoritised groups in contexts of higher education. Nevertheless, international students are not always considered an equity-seeking group, despite the structural barriers international students face. As a result, international students’ experiences of EDI remain underexplored and are typically examined from a perspective of internationalisation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences of five international students from the broader perspective of EDI at a Canadian university through a case study design. The findings demonstrate that, in spite of the university’s long-standing commitment to aspects of EDI, international students felt excluded and othered in the community. Their experiences pointed to a lack of intercultural awareness and sensitivity on the part of the superficially multicultural community, a lack of institution-led initiatives to include the students through socialisation with peers, and the limited internationalisation of the curriculum. This paper is concluded with a call for universities to recognise international students as a marginalised group in their EDI efforts and, potentially, address structural issues that internationalisation frameworks have neglected.","Tavares, Vander",,"Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics, York University"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which social justice, diversity, and equity are addressed in the foundational courses of the Purdue Teacher Education Program (PTEP). McDonald (2005) proposed a framework in which social justice is integrated across all experiences (e.g., courses, activities, clinical placements) in a teacher education program. In an analysis of PTEP, we found that each required course referenced social justice, diversity, and/or equity, albeit to varying degrees, including practical applications of knowledge related to these ideas. In her framework, McDonald recommended conceptual and practical tools related to social justice. In PTEP, such tools (e.g., differentiation, Universal Design for Learning, culturally responsive teaching) are incorporated across multiple courses through readings and assignments. In this investigation, we used curricular analyses, faculty input, and student experiences to identify the nature of social justice references in the program curricula, and also highlight productive connections that begin in the foundations courses and could be continued into the methods courses later in the program. With a better understanding of the program curricula, personnel can both enhance opportunities in their own courses, as well as capitalize on experiences offered in other courses.","PIRRELLO, JULIA",,Junior in Social Studies Education with a minor in Global Studies at Purdue University

We measured scholarship as the number of workshops presented and publications developed by the LEAD scholars. We used descriptive statistics and paired 2-tailed t tests to analyze the data. Seventy-five trainees completed LEAD; 99% (74 of 75) completed the retrospective pre-/post-surveys. There was statistically significant improvement in scholars' self-efficacy for all learning objectives. All trainees thought LEAD should continue. LEAD scholars have created workshops and presented at local, regional, and national conferences, as well published their findings. Scholars identified the greatest benefits as mentorship, developing friendships with UiM and ally peers outside of their subspecialty, and confidence in public speaking. LEAD is an innovative, feasible GME-wide model to improve resident and fellow self-efficacy and behaviors in DEI scholarship and leadership.","Powell, Carmin","Yemane, Lahia",

Multicultural Perspectives,2017,4,Flipping the Script from Talking to Teens about “Celebrating Diversity” to Promoting Equity Through Embracing Vulnerability and Enacting Courage.,"Diversity and inclusion are popular, yet often challenging, topics for youth in schools. A common approach to address the issues is to invite outside speakers to discuss ways to “celebrate diversity.” After being invited to give such a talk, I created and enacted a presentation at an affluent high school on this topic that is grounded in social justice education. The presentation flips the script from celebrating diversity to promoting equity by using a framework that connects embracing vulnerability with enacting courage. This article provides the theoretical underpinnings of this embodied approach. The presentation maneuvers include definitions of courage as connecting with others while embracing vulnerability; modeling the approach through shared personal counternarratives; defining related social justice terms and concepts; sharing counternarratives of young people; and providing an example of ways (in this case, promoting alliances) to create connections to promote equity. This approach can be a starting point to deeper understandings of inequity. The approach has the potential to encourage young people to embrace the marginalized parts of their identities and take actions against discrimination and oppression.","Bettez, Silvia",,The University of North Carolina at Greensboro

Diversity statements are a common but unexamined tool for recruiting a more diverse workforce. We surveyed more than 200 experts in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from US academic institutions to synthesize strengths and limitations of diversity statements and to develop guidelines for using such statements in faculty hiring. We found overwhelming agreement that diversity statements are a valuable tool for the advantages they offer the institution and applicant, but the experts indicated that diversity statements should be supported by other evidence. We further found that few institutions provide guidance on how to effectively use diversity statements in the hiring process. We address this need by providing an expert-derived evaluation framework for recognizing and rewarding DEI in the recruitment process that can be flexibly adapted to fit the unique requirements of diverse institutions and positions.","Bombaci, Sara P","Pejchar, Liba","Colorado State University , Fort Collins, Colorado, United States"

Literature Review: Building on the agentive pedagogical theories of Freire, Kegan and Stetsenko, I aim to outline the importance of integrating DEI into research methods courses and identify seven accessible ways in which to do so. Teaching Implications: Teachers will find a comprehensive review of the theory and research related to seven DEI teaching practices: (1) Diverse Representation/Visibility, (2) Modeling Inclusive Language/Practices, (3) Addressing Social Issues and Inequities, (4) Broadening the Applied Topical Scope, (5) Meaning-Making, (6) Teaching from a Strengths-Based Perspective, and (7) Promoting Students' Agency. Conclusion: Diversity, equity, and inclusion research methods courses can provide students with a clear model of inclusive practices, opportunities to develop sociorelational skills, and the tools to agentively contribute to social justice research.","Etengoff, Chana",,"Derner School of Psychology, 3479 Adelphi University, Garden City, NY, USA"
"Critical Sociology (Sage Publications, Ltd.)",2021,11,"""If Only We Are Brave Enough to Be It"": Demanding More from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts to Support Women Faculty of Color"".","The Black Lives Matter protests, the racial inequality laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol prompted several organizations and academic institutions to write statements in support of the Movement for Black Lives and to re-evaluate their dedication to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Using auto-ethnographical analysis, I address the inadequacy of such liberal initiatives to effectively challenge racial barriers to the promotion and retention of faculty of color, especially women of color. In fact, I argue that such initiatives could present further challenges for women of color, who are only included superficially and in ways that create more invisible, unrecognized labor. I propose that the language of DEI efforts must more centrally name racism at the same time that they address intersectionality through what I call racism-centered intersectional approaches. These approaches are particularly needed given the history of attacks on ethnic studies and critical race theory.","Beeman, Angie",,"Baruch College, USA"

"Sport, Education & Society",2021,11,"Development of a model of diversity, equity and inclusion for sport volunteers: an examination of the experiences of diverse volunteers for a national sport governing body.","This study explores the meaning of inclusion among Black, Brown and Indigenous Persons of Color (BIPOC) and LGBTQI+ volunteers of a national sport governing body. The study situates itself within socio-ecological and critical race theories to (a) examine the experience of inclusion (or lack thereof) for minoritized volunteers and (b) identify hindrances and enablers of inclusion. Volunteers perform essential roles within sport organizations, and increased diversity, equity, and inclusion is central for justice and performance reasons. However, limited research exists which critically examines the experience of volunteers from traditionally underrepresented populations. This study seeks to fill that gap. Improving diversity and inclusion within NGBs is not only likely to improve organizational performance, but also addresses issues of good governance and social justice. Semi-structured interviews coupled with narrative inquiry were employed to collect and analyze data. Findings suggest that volunteers experienced inclusion, or lack thereof, across four layered systems – personal, interpersonal, organizational and community. Within those layers, we identified the following subthemes: unique experience and viewpoint, personal responsibility, assimilation (individual); political/social capital, mentors (interpersonal); required commitment, inclusion not embedded in organizational cultural (organizational); implicit bias, microaggressions (community). From this model, we suggest characteristics of inclusive and non-inclusive organizations across a continuum of inclusion. Furthermore, the presented model fills a gap in existing literature and provides guidelines and specific actionable areas for organizations to develop environments that are more inclusive.","Legg, Eric","Karner, Erika","School of Community Resources & Development, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA"
Journal of Urbanism,2021,12,"Designing urban parks for inclusion, equity, and diversity.","Urban parks are vital spaces that provide the much-needed open space in cities offering numerous benefits and opportunities. One of the prime roles of urban parks is to fulfill the physiological and psychological needs of diverse populations. Empirically observing and analyzing park use can be an important tool toward reducing the gap between user needs and the planning, design, and management of urban parks. This paper reports the findings of systematic observation and evaluation of park design and management of two major urban parks in Cincinnati, Ohio. First, we conduct systematic on-site observation and document user-activity patterns at different times of day and week. Second, we graphically represent the observations using outputs from qualitative and quantitative analyses. Finally, we synthesize and analyze the observations to identify the dominant users of the parks, their behaviors and activities, and the utility of the park designs and facilities in serving the needs of the diverse social groups. The findings provide useful insights on aspects of park design that create affordances for diverse groups to use the park and ones that create territorial segregation, thus showing whether contemporary parks are inclusive, equitable, and diverse or not. The paper concludes with recommendations for designing for diversity in urban parks.","Mehta, Vikas","Mahato, Binita","University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"

Ethics & Behavior,2017,8,Expanding Diversity: Noncategorical Inclusion and Equity.,"Contemporary public policy and laws give strong support to equal protection and civil rights. This article argues that a modern society and each person therein should cultivate qualities in one’s self and others that will promote inclusion and equity to continually reduce and eventually eliminate unjust bias, prejudice, and discrimination (albeit perhaps an “impossible dream”). To date, equal protection has depended primarily on governmental regulations based on categorization of human factors. It is argued that everyone, particularly those persons granted “professional” status in society, should aspire for self-concept features that will move toward adopting and expanding inclusion to eliminate the need for categorization per se. Rather than diversity per se, inclusion and equity have contemporary support for better obtaining the personal and social values that can reduce bias, discrimination, and prejudice. It is recommended that interventions be directed at the structural, institutionalized, and close-minded barriers that exist in individual and collective decision making.","Woody, Robert Henley",,"Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska at Omaha"

Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,2021,10,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion: Tackling under-representation and recognition of talents in geochemistry and cosmochemistry.","Diversity, at every step along the scientific path, drives innovative research. Scientific societies, like the Geochemical Society (GS) and the European Association of Geochemistry (EAG), have a significant influence over which discoveries and innovators are celebrated. Such choices impact the future of research, and therefore influence the evolution of our discipline and its relationship to the global community. Our professional societies are well positioned to define and promote the success of all scientists, including those from under-represented groups, through proactive advocacy, inclusive mentorship, awards, and leadership. At present, only binary gender data are available to examine the distribution of under-represented groups among memberships, awardees, and leadership positions. To assess gender diversity in the geochemistry and cosmochemistry community, we have reviewed available records of GS and EAG membership through Goldschmidt Conference attendees, and compared these to awardees and leadership data. Awards have in the past been disproportionately given to white men, though this is changing. The GS and EAG have taken positive steps to increase both diversity of awardees (e.g., broadened definition of Fellows criteria) and inclusion (e.g., mentoring efforts aimed at early career and underrepresented minority scientists). This work identifies strategies to continue to improve professional societies' recognition of excellent science resulting in a more diverse representation of awardees. The strategies (e.g., revisions to award criteria and procedures to enlarge and diversify nomination pools) will require ongoing analysis and modifications. Future work is needed to address historically under-represented groups. We must work together to create a legacy of inclusion.","Pourret, Olivier","Anand, Pallavi","UniLaSalle, AGHYLE, 19 rue Pierre Waguet, 60026 Beauvais cedex, France"
Oncology Nursing Forum,2022,3,"ESTABLISHING A DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVE IN A CANCER CLINICAL TRIAL OFFICE AT AN ACADEMIC CENTER.","Clinical trial enrollment of minorities, particularly Latinx and Black patients, lags behind that of the general population. Our Cancer Center is an NCI Community Oncology Research Program for Minority and Underserved populations (MU-NCORP) with 48% enrollment to interventional clinical trials from underrepresented minority populations. While above the national average, interventions are needed to address these gaps. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted inequities in health care for communities of color. In response to this, our department created a task force comprised of nurses, nurse practitioners, and research staff with the goal of addressing barriers that prevent underrepresented minorities from enrolling in clinical trials as well as compounding factors that contribute to poor health outcomes. In regards to clinical trial representation, additional efforts are needed to ensure underrepresented minorities are included in studies. Following major events in 2020, our staff expressed the need to contribute in a meaningful way by examining the gaps within our department and the cancer center as a whole. Our goals are to reduce implicit bias particularly when approaching patients about clinical trials, address socio-economic barriers impacting enrollment of diverse patients, and increase visibility of clinical trials. The task force developed a survey to assess the experience of patients and clinical trial discussions. Questions ask about logistical barriers, interpersonal provider relationships, and patient perceptions of discrimination. The data from these surveys will inform tailored patient education regarding clinical trials and guide clinicians in the best way to communicate clinical trial information. The team meets regularly to tackle adjacent issues associated with lack of inclusion. Strategies include enhanced racial and ethnic minority leadership recruitment, transparency in research findings, creating tools for the retention of clinical trial participants, and using social media to address misconceptions. Establishing a diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative empowered our staff to make concrete steps towards increased health equity. Our team has formed relationships with patient advocates and collaborated the community engagement office to continue working on changing the stigma of clinical trials through public education. Future projects include cultural competency training for staff, social media campaign for clinical trials awareness, and interpreting data from patient surveys to implement changes in clinical practice.","Singh-Kandah, Shahnaz","Bentlyewski, Edward","CUIMC Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY"

The article discusses a range of factors to consider at each stage of the research process as researchers seek to be inclusive, responsive to diversity concerns, and seek equity. The researcher's perspective and positionality are discussed and the importance of critical self-examination of one's position in relation to the research is emphasized. Participatory and collaborative research processes are recommended, to engage with community partners, strengthen the validity of the findings, and help ensure that the research benefits the participants. Examples illustrate ways researchers might support diversity and inclusion with respect to sampling and measurement, cultural validity, and the conceptualization and operationalization of race. Recommendations are offered to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion when analyzing data, interpreting results, and writing up the study. The importance of a strengths-based approach and structural level analysis is emphasized. This article goes beyond discussion of the minimum, ""do no harm"" standard that researchers should meet in attending to diversity and inclusion in research and urges the pursuit of equity, anti-racism, and justice toward dismantling those structures that perpetuate violence in its many forms. Researchers are encouraged to ask themselves: Where would I situate my research? Is it racist, not racist, or anti-racist?

Programs in medical schools have begun to address health: inequities; however, interventions vary in intensity, effectiveness, and student experience. Intervention: The authors describe an intensive 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum for medical students in their orientation week prior to starting formal classes. Rather than using solely a knowledge-based ""cultural competence"" or a reflective ""cultural humility"" approach, an experiential curriculum was employed that links directly to fundamental communication skills vital to interactions with patients and teams, and critically important to addressing interpersonal disparities. Specifically, personal narratives were incorporated to promote individuation and decrease implicit bias, relationship-centered skills practice to improve communication across differences, and mindfulness skills to help respond to bias when it occurs. Brief didactics highlighting student and faculty narratives of difference were followed by small group sessions run by faculty trained to facilitate sessions on equity and inclusion. Context: Orientation week for matriculating first-year students at a US medical school. Impact: Matriculating students highly regarded an innovative 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion orientation curriculum that emphasized significant relationship-building with peers, in addition to core concepts and skills in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Lessons learned: This orientation represented an important primer to concepts, skills, and literature that reinforce the necessity of training in diversity, equity, and inclusion. The design team found that intensive faculty development and incorporating diversity concepts into fundamental communication skills training were necessary to perpetuate this learning. Two areas of further work emerged: (1) the emphasis on addressing racism and racial equity as paradigmatic belies further essential understanding of intersectionality, and (2) uncomfortable conversations about privilege and marginalization arose, requiring expert facilitation.","Davis, Denise L.

Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law,2022,1,Solving for Law Firm Inclusion: The Necessity of Lawyer Well-Being.,"Chances are, in a room of one hundred law firm partners in the United States, at most, one Black woman would be present. Statistically, if there were a Black, Latinx, or Asian woman in that room, she would be the only one. Women of color make up only 3.79 percent of all partners, counting equity and nonequity partners. The percentage of Black women among all partners has remained solidly under one percent--0.57 percent in 2009 and 0.80 percent in 2020. And so, women of color lawyers starting at law firms inevitably enter spaces that are overwhelmingly white and male--spaces where their well-being is not understood, much less prioritized. These same spaces are also home to a significant level of stress, substance abuse, and depression, rendering the law firm business ill-equipped to be welcoming and supportive. Attrition ensues and underrepresentation continues. To evolve into truly inclusive workplaces, law firms must act to embed lawyer well-being as an institutional piece of their diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. For law firms, the ""racial reckoning"" and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2021, with negative impacts falling disproportionately on women of color lawyers, have only complicated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and well-being challenges. This Article proposes that law firms take concrete steps to solidify a holistic, interconnected approach to well-being and inclusion. Part II will provide an overview of the state of lawyer well-being and the representation of women of color lawyers at law firms. Part III will explore the impact of the events of 2020-21 on women of color lawyers. Part IV will highlight and critique recent law firm efforts on well-being and DEI.

This time, perhaps, sustained change is within reach. As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health—for lower income workers, in particular—with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity. The provided recommendations can support employer goals of achieving greater equity and value in workforce health, measurably contributing to business success.","Sherman, Bruce W.","Kelly, Rebecca K.","Department of Public Health Education, University of North Carolina, Greensboro, NC, USA"

We also examine whether these associations differ based on Latinx youth’s gender and sexual orientation. The sample included 2,017 Latinx youth (ages 11–21; 49% girls) from middle schools and high schools across the United States based on path analyses, we found that school-based discrimination is negatively associated with SEL and that commitment to DEI buffers the negative impact of discrimination on SEL. Multigroup analyses revealed some differences in the path analyses among girls compared to boys and sexual minority youth compared to heterosexual youth. Our findings suggest that school commitment to DEI can be protective against the negative effects of school-based discrimination on SEL for Latinx students and highlight the importance of considering within-group differences among Latinx youth.","Ramos Carranza, Perla","Boat, Ashley","University of California, Irvine, USA"

Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion are major concerns in the construction industry. The goal of the present study is to enable the assessment of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry by identifying and determining the level of influence of applicable indicators revealing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the workforce level. A two-round survey and a panel of 16 experts were utilized to achieve the research goal. After collecting and analyzing the responses, 10 indicators were found to be influential in terms of achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and were therefore considered measures of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion. These indicators are (1) ethnic and racial diversity at the company level; (2) gender diversity and inclusion at the workforce level; (3) a corporate policy statement on diversity and inclusion; (4) gender/ethnic diversity in leadership/management positions; (5) knowledge and skill diversity; (6) equitable pay/compensation at the industry level; (7) equality, social justice, and nondiscrimination policy statement; (8) pay structure transparency; (9) equitable pay/compensation at the company level; and (10) merit-based transparent recruitment and promotion. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means of assessing workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry. It is expected that utilizing the identified indicators would help managers and human resources specialists/professionals in construction perform a thorough assessment of the level of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness of the workforce within their organizations and identify opportunities for enhancing the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusiveness.","Karakhan, Ali A.","Gambatese, John A.","Faculty Member, Dept. of Reconstruction and Projects, Univ. of Baghdad, Baghdad 10071, Iraq"

To enhance and highlight commitments to diversity, many academic department and health organizations have designated individuals to serve as their DEI leader. However, suboptimal structure and support of this specific leadership position have limited its potential and have led to increased position turnover and stagnation in progress. To mitigate these challenges, the Orthopaedic Diversity Leadership Consortium (ODLC) was formed as a growing network of orthopaedic diversity leaders from around the United States as well as international members and industry affiliates. The mission of ODLC is to optimize the sustainability of DEI efforts by providing professional development support and best-practice solutions to leaders serving in this capacity. The efforts of the organization are guided by 3 key objectives: leadership development, design of strategic plan models for diversity, and interprofessional education for perioperative care teams on inclusion. Through this powerful network and its educational offerings, ODLC works to increase role efficacy and to encourage sustainable creation of diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments for our patients, colleagues, and team members.","Taylor, Erica","Dacus, A.

Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) are critical for a student's professional and interpersonal skill development and key for recruiting and retaining students from diverse groups to ecology. However, few resources exist that speak directly to an undergraduate researcher on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) dimensions of embarking on a first research experience. Here, we write primarily for undergraduate readers, though a broader audience of readers, especially URE mentors, will also find this useful. We explain many of the ways a URE benefits undergraduate researchers and describe how URE students from different positionalities can contribute to an inclusive research culture. We address three common sources of anxiety for URE students through a DEI lens: imposter syndrome, communicating with mentors, and safety in fieldwork. We discuss the benefits as well as the unique vulnerabilities and risks associated with fieldwork, including the potential for harassment and assault. Imposter syndrome and toxic field experiences are known to drive students, including students from underrepresented minority groups, out of STEM. Our goal is to encourage all students, including those from underrepresented groups, to apply for UREs, build awareness of their contributions to inclusion in ecology research, and provide strategies for overcoming known barriers.","McGill, Bonnie M.","Foster, Madison J.","Kansas Biological Survey, University of Kansas, Lawrence KS,, USA"

The purpose of this study was to create and evaluate a formal mentorship program open to URMs and allies with interests in diversity, equity, and inclusion. A mentorship program incorporating a virtual platform was designed by the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee. It was structured to include 6 sessions over 6 months with matched mentor-mentee pairs based on responses to a publicized online interest form. A compilation of evidence-based guidelines was provided to optimize the mentorship relationship. Linked pre- and postprogram surveys were administered to collect demographic data, define baseline goals and level of support, and evaluate program satisfaction. Thirty-five mentor-mentee pairs were matched; 31 mentees completed the preprogram survey and 17 completed the postprogram survey. Preprogram, only 3 mentees (9.7%) reported satisfaction with current mentorship and 5 (16%) reported mechanisms or mentorship in place at their program to support URMs. On the postprogram survey, mentees reported high satisfaction with areas of mentorship, mentor attributes, and the program overall. Opportunities for improvement include implementation of mechanisms to enhance communication with mentor-mentee pairs and maintain longitudinal engagement. In the first tailored mentorship program in RO for URMs and those with diversity, equity, and inclusion interests, our results demonstrate that there is self-reported interest for better mentorship for URMs in RO, and that a nationwide structured mentorship program can address participants' goals with high satisfaction. Program expansion could provide URMs and allies in RO more opportunities for career development and promote a greater sense of community and inclusion within the field.","Germino, Elizabeth A.","Saripalli, Anjali L.","Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California"

Disability & Rehabilitation,2023,5,"""Your double-blind RCT needs feminism"": an argument for engaging critical theory in quantitative rehabilitation research.","Rehabilitation science has, for years, endorsed a connection between quantitative research and the philosophical assumptions of positivism. These assumptions can limit the scope of rehabilitation research, particularly in relation to matters of equity, diversity, and inclusivity. As our field moves toward a greater focus on inclusivity in research design and patient-centred care, it is imperative that we reconsider the theoretical foundations of rehabilitation research and practice. We provide an analysis of positivism on equity, diversity, and inclusivity within quantitative rehabilitation research, using the Participant Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) model to provide structure for the resultant discussion and recommendations. Our analysis reveals that there are significant limitations and ethical concerns to engaging in positivism as the primary paradigm for quantitative rehabilitation research. We argue that decoupling of positivism and quantitative research methods may be warranted. Equitable and inclusive rehabilitation research requires the researcher to consider variables which are neglected in the positivist paradigm. We argue that critical theory can equip researchers with a lens to better address injustices within rehabilitation research. We provide a series of recommendations for researchers to engage critical theory at each stage of the PICO model of clinical trials. Common assumptions in quantitative rehabilitation research (i.e., positivism) can limit the utility of research findings to rehabilitation patients. Equitable, diverse, and inclusive participant samples in research better reflect the diversity of real world rehabilitation patients, helping us better serve these populations. Critical theory can help researchers and clinicians identify and avoid interventions that may cause harm to rehabilitation patients. Research and practice that prioritize concepts of ""normalcy"" (i.e., ""normal gait,"" ""normal behaviours"") may perpetuate negative concepts of disability and further marginalize the individuals that our interventions aim to serve.","Slade, Teri","Duebel, Erin","Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"

Journal of Medical Education & Curricular Development,2021,1,"Start the Way You Want to Finish: An Intensive Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Orientation Curriculum in Undergraduate Medical Education.","Problem: Medical students often feel unprepared to care for patients whose cultural backgrounds differ from their own. Programs in medical schools have begun to address health: inequities; however, interventions vary in intensity, effectiveness, and student experience. Intervention: The authors describe an intensive 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion curriculum for medical students in their orientation week prior to starting formal classes. Rather than using solely a knowledge-based ""cultural competence"" or a reflective ""cultural humility"" approach, an experiential curriculum was employed that links directly to fundamental communication skills vital to interactions with patients and teams, and critically important to addressing interpersonal disparities. Specifically, personal narratives were incorporated to promote individuation and decrease implicit bias, relationship-centered skills practice to improve communication across differences, and mindfulness skills to help respond to bias when it occurs. Brief didactics highlighting student and faculty narratives of difference were followed by small group sessions run by faculty trained to facilitate sessions on equity and inclusion. Context: Orientation week for matriculating first-year students at a US medical school. Impact: Matriculating students highly regarded an innovative 2-day diversity, equity, and inclusion orientation curriculum that emphasized significant relationship-building with peers, in addition to core concepts and skills in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Lessons learned: This orientation represented an important primer to concepts, skills, and literature that reinforce the necessity of training in diversity, equity, and inclusion. The design team found that intensive faculty development and incorporating diversity concepts into fundamental communication skills training were necessary to perpetuate this learning. Two areas of further work emerged: (1) the emphasis on addressing racism and racial equity as paradigmatic belies further essential understanding of intersectionality, and (2) uncomfortable conversations about privilege and marginalization arose, requiring expert facilitation.","Davis, Denise L.

Using autoethnography as methodology, we suggest that the practices of “border crossings” of intersectional academics can help track the multidirectional impacts of institutional diversity and inclusion discourses within Australian universities. As class and race intermix, we operate in a metaphorical “shadowland”; our border criss-crossings and places of dwelling highlight the blurriness of privileged and marginalised identities, with some minoritised statuses seemingly too visible while others are obscured. Despite this, and albeit brought into being through largely unrewarded emotional labour, our emphasis is on demonstrating how intersectional subjects’ dialoguing in academe is a form of quiet resistance, offering hope for creating new becomings.","Lahiri-Roy, Reshmi","Martinussen, Maree","School of Education, Federation University"

Teaching of Psychology,2021,1,"Rethinking the Course Syllabus: Considerations for Promoting Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.","Introduction: Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are receiving considerable attention in higher education. Within psychology, the American Psychological Association has highlighted the importance of cultural diversity in both undergraduate and graduate curricula and charged educators with facilitating the development of cultural competence among learners. Statement of the Problem: Many resources have been developed to help promote EDI within higher education. The resources developed have mainly focused on the curricula and pedagogical approaches, yet the syllabus remains overlooked with few guidelines available to educators. Literature Review: We offer several considerations informed by theoretical frameworks and best practices in the discipline and suggestions for the successful implementation of EDI in the syllabus. Teaching Implications: This article provides a comprehensive and useful guide for developing a syllabus that assists with the integration of EDI, as the syllabus is the first opportunity for faculty to communicate their philosophy, expectations, requirements, and other course information. Conclusion: Infusing EDI in the syllabus is essential for promoting an inclusive learning environment and is conducive to establishing goals related to cultural competence.","Fuentes, Milton A.","Zelaya, David G.","Department of Psychology, Montclair State University, NJ, USA"
Proceedings of the Association for Information Science & Technology,2022,10,"Towards a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Competency Framework: A Content Analysis of Visible DEI Efforts on LIS Associations' Websites.","In this poster, we report the findings of an investigation of 28 LIS associations' DEI efforts as evidenced through their websites. The DEI efforts were documented in terms of whether DEI was mentioned in associations' missions and goals, their code of conducts, and their competency frameworks, whether the associations provided DEI definitions, whether there were position statements, whether there were dedicated units leading the DEI efforts, whether there were specific DEI resources, and whether there were relevant contents on the homepage or as menu items. While we discovered the common patterns of DEI practice, we also uncovered notable gaps. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of associations in promoting and fostering DEI, it also shows the need for a consistent and visible effort for LIS associations to lead their professional community toward a robust work in DEI and developing a DEI competency framework for LIS professionals.","Tang, Rong","Hu, Zhan","Simmons University, , USA"
"Primus: Problems, Resources & Issues in Mathematics Undergraduate Studies",2021,1,"The Eighth Characteristic for Successful Calculus Programs: Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Practices.","Through a multi-year, national calculus study, researchers have recently identified seven characteristics of successful college calculus programs. We identified these seven characteristics by visiting five doctoral-granting mathematics departments with successful calculus programs and uncovering the common traits among them. These seven traits common among the collection of five universities were: robust GTA teaching preparation, coordination of courses, support of active learning, comprehensive placement strategies, collection and attention to local data, abundant student supports, and rigorous content. Further analysis and reflection on the previously gathered data indicates that the earlier study actually identified characteristics of calculus programs that successfully serve a majority white or Asian and male population. In this article, I argue that attention to an eighth characteristic comprised of diversity, equity and inclusion practices along with the other seven can enable a department to create a truly successful calculus program by understanding and attending to the unique needs of historically marginalized populations.","Hagman, Jessica Ellis",,

Psi Chi Journal of Psychological Research,2022,12,Guidance for Researchers When Using Inclusive Demographic Questions for Surveys: Improved and Updated Questions.,"This article is an updated version of Hughes et al.'s (2016) article, which encouraged authors to think about and update the demographic questions they use in their research surveys. Hughes et al. (2016) wrote the original article because they could not find a comprehensive resource that gave researchers examples of well-written and representative demographic questions based on the research literature. Since that original article, new and revised terminology related to demographics has emerged and scholarship on equity, diversity, and inclusion has flourished, so the need to present a set of updated demographic questions arose. Based on the recommendation from the APA Journal Article Reporting Standards, Appelbaum et al. (2018) recommended that researchers report the following major demographic characteristics for their samples, which are presented in this article (i.e., age, gender identity and sex assigned at birth, ethnicity and race, and socioeconomic status and social class). They also suggested that researchers assess other demographic characteristics that are important to their specific research, so the most common additional options from the psychological literature (i.e., children, citizenship and immigration status, disability, education, employment, income, language, location, relationship status, religion, and sexual orientation) are included as well. For each of these demographic domains, both questions and more inclusive answer choices are presented. This work is important because it can help researchers to gather and present more accurate information about survey participants' identities and demonstrates that researchers value inclusion and diversity when conducting their research (Hughes et al., 2016).","Hughes, Jennifer L.","Camden, Abigail A.","Department of Psychology, Agnes Scott College"
"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics",2022,11,"A Comprehensive Overview of Academic Radiation Oncology Departmental Efforts in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.","Consistent and intentional promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts within healthcare is a critical step to eliminate health inequities. While health systems and medical schools have traditionally promoted such efforts through dedicated offices and leaders, individual departments within institutions are increasingly organizing to create formal, department-level DEI initiatives. Although considerable work has been done to examine and improve DEI efforts in radiation oncology (RO), little data are available describing current departmental-level DEI efforts. The purpose of this study was to examine and describe current RO departmental-level DEI efforts, obstacles, successes, and perceived impact. Department chairs and or program directors from 124 RO departments with affiliated medical schools were contacted to inquire whether their department had a formal DEI leader. An invitation to participate in an anonymous survey was sent to DEI leaders from June to July 2021. Electronic surveys consisted of multiple choice, five-point Likert-type scale, and open-ended free-text questions regarding demographics of RO DEI leaders, existence of a DEI committee, involvement of other department members, connection with the institution, departmental DEI activities, support for DEI activities, barriers to success, and perceptions of impact. Descriptive statistics and qualitative summary of free text responses were reported. Among the 124 RO departments contacted, there were 85 respondents (68.5% response rate). Of the respondents, 48 (56.5%) reported having a departmental DEI leader and were invited to participate with a total of 34 (70.8%) participants completing the survey. DEI leadership demographics included 25 women (73.1%), 28 assistant or associate professors (82.2%), and 18 identifying as of non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity (53.6%). Of the 19 (55.9%) departmental DEI committees, over half (n=10, 52.6%) started in 2020 or later. Resources for DEI efforts were not commonly provided, with only a few respondents reporting receipt of administrative support (38.2%), funding (29.4%), protected time (23.5%), or increased compensation (23.5%). Among respondents, the perceived impact of DEI initiatives included an increased culture of respect (89.7%) and an improved awareness of both healthcare inequities (75.9%) and systematic/structural racism (79.3%). Departmental DEI efforts are increasingly common within RO, however, the structure, resources, and recognition associated with DEI work are variable. Additional dedicated resources and recognition for these efforts will help ensure a culture of inclusive excellence for the RO workforce and patients.","Franco, I.I.","Paradis, K.C.","Harvard Radiation Oncology Program, Boston, MA"

Objective: To describe the variability of DEI content in residency programs and compare DEI website content by specialty. Methods: Using the 2021 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) list of residency programs, residency training websites were identified and evaluated. Information was extracted from program websites as indicators of DEI content. Chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA were chosen to assess for statistical differences. Results: In total, 4644 program websites representing 26 specialties were assessed. Among all the programs, the average DEI completeness of a program website was 6.1±14.6% (range 0–100%). While 6.2% of all programs had a diversity webpage, only 13.3% included a commitment to DEI, and few programs (2.7%) provided information about underrepresented in medicine (URiM) faculty. Conclusions: Graduate medical education programs can enhance information for current and prospective applicants about DEI initiatives on their websites. Including DEI initiatives on residency websites may improve diversity recruitment efforts.","Wei, Chapman","Bernstein, Simone A.","Department of Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital and Northwell Health, 475 Seaview Ave, 10305, Staten Island, NY, USA"

Clinical Infectious Diseases,2023,3,"Demographic Representation Among Speakers and Program Committee Members at the IDWeek Conference, 2013–2021.","Background In 2016, the IDWeek program committee was charged with ensuring gender equity in speaker sessions. Whether this charge also resulted in more opportunities for historically underrepresented speakers is unknown. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of trends in the demographic composition of IDWeek speakers and program committee members between 2013 and 2021. We used descriptive statistics to summarize data, χ2 tests to compare speaker demographics between 2013–2016 (before 2016) and 2017–2021 (after 2016), and Cochran–Armitage tests for trend. Each speaker slot was considered an independent event. Results A total of 5482 speaker slots were filled by 3389 individuals from 2013 to 2021. There was a linear increase in female speakers from 38.6% in 2013 to 58.4% in 2021 (P <.001). The proportion of white speakers decreased overall from 84.9% in 2013 to 63.5% in 2021. Compared with white speakers, more slots were filled by Asian speakers after 2016 versus before 2016 (20.1% vs 14.8%, respectively; P <.001). Program committee members from 2013–2021 were >80% non-Hispanic white; <5% of committee members identified as black, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic. More program committee slots were filled by women after 2016 than before 2016 (52.7% vs 33.9%; P =.004). Conclusions Intentional consideration of gender equity by the program committee was associated with equitable gender representation of invited speakers at IDWeek after 2016. Gradually, the proportions of IDWeek speakers from historically excluded racial/ethnic approached their respective proportions in the IDSA membership. White speakers remained overrepresented relative to membership proportions until 2021, and gaps in program committee racial/ethnic demographic representation highlights opportunities for continued inclusion, diversity, access, and equity at IDWeek.","Marcelin, Jasmine R","Khazanchi, Rohan","Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center , Omaha, Nebraska , USA"

Aims: To determine the views and perceptions of Australian medical students, and junior doctors in the first five years of practice, toward obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) as a career, including whether there are any perceived barriers to the pursuit of such a career. Materials and Methods: A semi‐structured questionnaire was developed with members of the RANZCOG Gender Equity and Diversity Working Group There were two separate studies: the first involved telephone interviews of medical students across three campuses of a medical school in North Queensland. The second study surveyed junior doctors in Queensland who are members of the Australian Medical Association. Responses were analysed and compared using quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: Both studies found that experiences with O&G as a medical student influenced the decision to pursue O&G as a career. Exclusion from clinical scenarios and difficulty establishing good relationship with midwives within busy birthing suites were some reasons deterring male students from O&G. In addition, students felt poorly informed about the specialty in their preclinical years, affecting their early decisions in choice of specialty. Post‐rotation, more female than male students reported positive experiences and were considering O&G as a career. Conclusions: Both groups see medical student experience as critical in attitudes toward the specialty as a possible career. This experience plays a significant role in encouraging female students toward a career in O&G and discouraging male students. More exposure to the specialty in the preclinical years, and attention to improving clinical rotations for all students, is required.","Win Kyaw, Monyi","Cheng, Hon C.","Cairns Hospital, James Cook University, Cairns Queensland,, Australia"

Skeletal Radiology,2022,4,Diversity and perception of equity and respect in the Society of Skeletal Radiology (SSR).,"Purpose: To assess the perception of equity and respect in the workplace and within the SSR. We hypothesized that responses would differ by gender and minorities underrepresented in medicine (URiM) status. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to 1,531 SSR members between January 2020 and March 2020 to determine perception of equity and respect. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and analysis of differences in response by gender/minority status was performed using the Fisher's exact test. The study was exempt from IRB approval. Results: There were 176 responses (11.5%). Most respondents (61.9%) were between 30 and 50 years. Members identified as male (M) in 74.4%, as female (F) in 25.0%, and as ""other"" in 0.6%. URiM comprised 9.1% of members. Women worked more commonly in academia (p = 0.005), had the perception of unequal opportunities for leadership positions within the institution (p = 0.006), and emphasized the importance of having a mentor of the same gender (p = 0.001). URiM members were less likely to hold a leadership position (p = 0.1, trend), had a perception of unequal opportunities for leadership positions within the institution (p = 0.06, trend), and reported the importance of having a mentor of the same race (p = 0.06, trend). There were no significant differences between gender or URiM status and perception of the SSR to provide an inclusive environment and leadership opportunities (p ≥ 0.39). Conclusion: While survey participation was limited and potentially biased, respondents perceived that women and minorities have fewer opportunities and are treated with lower regard in the workplace compared to male, non-minority colleagues.","Bredella, Miriam A.","Chung, Christine B.","Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging and Intervention, Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Yawkey 6E, 55 Fruit Street, 02114, Boston, MA, USA"

Inclusive education is the entitlement of all children and young people to quality education, irrespective of their differences or dispositions. It is about embracing educational values of equity, diversity and social justice. The data which underpins this paper was obtained through research commissioned by the Department of Education (DE) Northern Ireland (NI) which sought to identify existing practices that increased the motivation, participation and achievement of all pupils of school age with special educational needs (Moran & Abbott, 2006). Head teachers and Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) views were sought on the effectiveness of ITE programmes in preparing student teachers to work in inclusive school settings.","Moran, Anne",,University Of Ulster
Advances in Physiology Education,2020,9,"Knowledge gains in a professional development workshop on diversity, equity, inclusion, and implicit bias in academia.","As literature indicates, historic racism and implicit bias throughout academia have been profound metrics leading to a lack of diversity, as related to people from underrepresented groups according to race and ethnicity, among biomedical sciences graduate students in U.S. universities. Recognizing such challenges, a team of biomedical scientists and inclusivity educators developed and implemented a pilot training program within an academic health sciences center as an initial step to educate faculty and staff regarding their roles in the promotion of an inclusive academic environment, receptive to all students, including underrepresented students. The 3-h workshop included didactic modules, videos, teaching modules, and active attendee participation. Faculty and staff were presented common terminology and ways to promote the development of an inclusive and diverse academic workforce. Compared with pre-workshop, post-workshop survey results indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of ""implicit bias,"" ""status leveling,"" ""color-blind racial attitudes,"" ""tokenism,"" and ""failure to differentiate."" Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. This preliminary initiative was successful in the introduction of faculty and staff to the importance of fostering an inclusive academic environment and thereby developing a diverse workforce.","Harrison-Bernard, Lisa M.","Augustus-Wallace, Allison C.","Department of Physiology, Louisiana State University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana"

The events of 2020 ignited global attention to systemic racism and racial inequalities, including the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy and especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Racial and ethnic diversity in graduate programs in particular warrants special attention as graduate students of color report experiencing alarming rates of racism, discrimination, microaggressions, and other exclusionary behaviors. As part of the Graduate Dean's Advisory Council on Diversity (GDACD) at the University of California Merced, the authors of this manuscript held a year-long discussion on these issues and ways to take meaningful action to address these persistent issues of injustices. We have outlined 10 rules to help graduate programs develop antiracist practices to promote racial and ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in the academy. We focus on efforts to address systemic causes of the underrepresentation and attrition of students from minoritized communities. The 10 rules are developed to allow graduate groups to formulate and implement rules and policies to address root causes of underrepresentation of minoritized students in graduate education.","Perez-Lopez, Edgar","Gavrilova, Larisa","Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Merced, California, United States of America"

Boston University Law Review,2023,2,THE COLOR OF LAW REVIEW.,"Of the approximately sixty-five Black law review Editors-in-Chief (“EICs”) throughout U.S. history, at least thirty-eight—more than half—were elected in the past ten years. What inspired the dramatic increase in the diversity of law review leadership in recent history, and why has it taken so long? This question—what this Article calls law review’s ongoing “diversity problem”— does not have an easy answer. While legal scholars have been talking about diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) on law review boards for far longer than the past decade, no law school has yet to solve it. Further, even as an increasing number of law schools promote DEI in the classroom, from creating antiracist curricula to appointing diversity-focused administrators, only a handful of law schools seem to be paying much attention to the diversity of their law review boards. The overwhelming silence of law schools amidst the persistent racial and ethnic homogeneity of their law reviews suggests that some law school administrators believe the problem lies with the merit of their non)White students. Or, perhaps some believe that law review’s diversity problem is merely symptomatic of ongoing challenges to admit more underrepresented students into J.D. programs nationwide. This Article argues that law review’s diversity problem must be viewed in the broader context of sociopolitical efforts to eradicate racial injustice in the United States and reform legal education. Applying a critical racial lens toward efforts to promote DEI in law review, this Article clarifies three fundamental drivers of law review’s diversity problem, with implications not just for law review, but for legal education writ large. First, this Article claims that the purpose of DEI for law reviews is not solely to increase the number of racially and ethnically minoritized students on the law review roster to enhance the learning experience of student editors, but also to realign the distorted function of law review with its ideal purpose. Second, it argues that the role of law review’s DEI is not merely to increase the equality of opportunities for underrepresented students or broad-based discussion of marginalized experiences and diverse perspectives of law, but also to challenge the fundamental structure of the sociolegal institutions that coordinate legal education in the United States. Finally, this Article contends that the value of DEI for law reviews is not simply the increased number of marginalized voices engaged in mainstream legal discourse, but, perhaps most importantly, the inclusion of voices into mainstream legal discourse that do not always have the perceived academic merit or societal prestige necessary to gain access.","PARKS, GREGORY S.","TOUSSAINT, ETIENNE C.","Associate Dean of Strategic Initiatives, Professor of Law, Wake Forest University School of Law."
Missouri Law Review,2023,1,The NCAA's Punts on Transgender Student-Athlete Participation.,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association (""NCAA""), which serves as college athletics's national governing body, states that its basic purposes include supporting and promoting healthy and safe college athletics. It accomplishes this through its stated principles, which include conducting athletics designed to protect, support, and enhance student-athletes' physical and mental health and its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. These are tall tasks, as half a million student-athletes compete in NCAA-sponsored sports. The NCAA also enjoys a history of taking strong stances on perceived discrimination. More specifically, the NCAA has used its economic influence to effect changes to state legislation or practices that it finds discriminatory. Recent examples include North Carolina's so-called ""bathroom bill"" and Mississippi's inclusion of the Confederate battle symbol on its state flag. The NCAA recently had two opportunities to continue this strong anti-discriminatory history when faced with decisions regarding transgender athlete participation. However, in a departure from its past practices, the NCAA effectively punted in both instances, surprising and disappointing many college athletics constituents, including countless student-athletes. This Article scrutinizes the NCAA's surprisingly passive response to states' efforts to ban transgender girls and women from sports participation aligning with their gender identity and its recent revisions to rules regarding transgender student-athlete participation in NCAA sports. The Article's first Part explores the NCAA's governance, stated goals and missions, and history of strong and effective actions in response to laws, practices, and symbols it finds discriminatory. The second Part analyzes the NCAA's response--or lack thereof--to some states' efforts to prohibit transgender individuals from participating in sports aligning with their gender identity. Part III critiques the NCAA's recent revisions to transgender student-athlete participation eligibility rules, concluding that they effectively amount to a second punt. A brief conclusion follows.","Lens, Josh",,"Assistant Professor of Recreation and Sport Management at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (J.D., University of Iowa College of Law)"

Studies in Higher Education,2023,2,Elite schools lead: an empirical examination of diversity requirements in higher education job markets.,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements for job applicants in higher education are somewhat controversial. Advocates argue that DEI requirements ensure fair representation, counter historical discrimination, and improve efficiency. Critics contend that DEI requirements reduce faculty quality by limiting the number of eligible applicants and by screening out heterodox views, thereby limiting potential research. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of mandatory DEI statements is growing; yet, there have been no empirical investigations of their frequency, nor how such requirements vary across academic disciplines, geographic region, and university selectivity. We audit a sample of academic job postings (n = 999) during September-October 2020, finding that nearly twenty percent require DEI statements. We find selective universities are significantly more likely to require DEI statements than non-selective universities, while academic disciplines (i.e. social sciences, STEM) are not significant predictors of DEI statements.

Hence, the purpose of this report is to offer perspectives gained from the delivery of a DEI curriculum within a pharmacy residency program aimed at expanding experiential learning focused on DEI and health equity. <bold>Program Implementation:</bold> Pharmacy residents at an academic medical center were invited to participate in a longitudinal DEI/equity seminar series that was thoughtfully and strategically developed by a team of residents and program leadership based on a six-step process. Residents were offered 9 individual seminars covering 4 major focus areas to facilitate enhanced awareness, learning, and vulnerability. Participants were invited to provide evaluations of each seminar and the overall series. <bold>Program Assessment:</bold> A total of 41 residents (100%) participated in at least one of the 9 seminars that were offered and approximately 50% completed the post-series survey. Resident-perceived benefit of each individual session was consistently favorable. Additionally, greater than 70% of participants responded favorably when asked about the impact of each session on their awareness, resources provided, and ability to apply the learnings to their practice. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our inaugural experience with the integration of a DEI seminar series into a pharmacy residency program suggests that there is a clear benefit to including DEI/health equity into pharmacy residency training. This data may suggest that adoption of DEI-focused experiential training may increase cultural awareness and the availability of resources to better equip pharmacy residents in applying concepts of DEI into their practice.","Tillman, Frank III","Liu, Ina","20054 Durham Veterans Affairs Healthcare System , Durham, NC, USA"

In the quest for gender equity, medicine, with its abundance of highly educated and qualified women, should be leading the way. The sheer number of women who comprise the majority of pediatricians in the United States suggests this specialty has a unique opportunity to stand out as progressively equitable. Indeed, there has been much progress to celebrate for women in medicine and pediatrics. However, many challenges remain, and there are areas in which progress is too slow, stalled, or even regressing. The fair treatment of women pediatricians will require enhanced and simultaneous commitment from leaders in 4 key gatekeeper groups: academic medical centers, hospitals, health care organizations, and practices; medical societies; journals; and funding agencies. In this report, we describe the 6-step equity, diversity, and inclusion cycle, which provides a strategic methodology to (1) examine equity, diversity, and inclusion data; (2) share results with stakeholders; (3) investigate causality; (4) implement strategic interventions; (5) track outcomes and adjust strategies; and (6) disseminate results.

Promoting employee voice is one strategy to support equity; however, employee perceptions of who has a voice at work may be increasingly unbalanced in the post-2020 workplace. Thus, drawing from an original survey dataset of workers across 20 countries and regions (n = 9197), we use logistic regression to explore how sociodemographic characteristics and perceptions of inclusion at work predict whether participants believe they help influence important decisions at work (our measure of employee voice). Across our global sample, we found that although feelings of inclusion predict the perception that one has more voice, workers who belong to groups historically marginalized in the workplace due to gender, education level, compensation type, leadership status, and self-identified ""minority"" status report lower levels of agreement with the statement of voice. We conclude that while promoting feelings of inclusion is one strategy for achieving a greater diversity of employee voices at work, organizations should also take concrete steps (such as diversifying leadership) to reach equity more fully regarding voice.","Dalessandro, Cristen","Lovell, Alexander","O.C.

Women & Health,2023,2,Gender disparity among ophthalmologists awarded Canadian institute of health research grants.,"Despite efforts toward equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic ophthalmology faculties, gender disparity continues to exist. Current evidence indicates that female ophthalmologists consistently hold lower academic ranks and receive less funding from the National Institutes of Health compared to their male colleagues. The extent of this disparity is unknown in the Canadian context. We sought to characterize the gender gap in Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding among ophthalmologists. From inception, funding decision data were collected from the official Canadian Institutes of Health Research website database hosted by the Government of Canada. Measures including gender, number of grants held over the study period, number of simultaneous grants, and total funding were collected. Female ophthalmologists were consistently awarded fewer grants (21.43 percent) compared to male counterparts and were less likely to hold multiple grants since 2008. An over five-fold disparity was found in total funding for female compared to male ophthalmologists. As well, females were less likely than males to hold a grant in each particular year except in 2020. Female ophthalmologists continue to face barriers to attaining academic support from Canadian Institute of Health Research funds. Continued action to mitigate this gender gap may improve gender-based parity in federal research funding.","Tien, Chi-Wei","Tao, Brendan","Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"

Public Services Quarterly,2023,1,The spirit of knowledge: Creating spiritual competency for critical information spaces.,"The industry-wide effort to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices into the LIS field opens a wider conversation for fostering cultural humility in LIS work. Cultural humility, a necessary aspect of DEI, cannot be achieved by approaching non-Western cultures through Western assumptions of the world when these assumptions perpetuate the mystification, alienation, and invalidation of non-Western cultural knowledge and expression—especially those that center metaphysical or spiritual aspects in their knowledge systems. Unless disrupted, this limitation of current DEI initiatives will further invalidate cultural practices, identity, and Indigenous Systems of Knowledge, leading to whitewashed representations of culture within collections, reference services, programming, and other library systems. This paper discusses spiritual competency as a prerequisite to cultural humility, the harm caused by its absence, as well as the tools and frameworks that, when practiced, can create spiritual competency.","Eyre, Mei'lani",,"Information School, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"

Journal of Academic Librarianship,2023,1,Academic libraries and DEI initiatives: A quantitative study of employee satisfaction.,"This survey study explored employees' of academic libraries, specifically R1 and R2 Doctoral Universities in the United States, attitudes regarding their overall level of satisfaction with the implementation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at their places of work in regard to the promotion of DEI culture at their institutions, the ability to pursue DEI work in their day-to-day work, and the alignment of their personal values with their libraries, universities, and surrounding communities. The findings suggest that while most respondents felt there was acceptable buy-in from library and university employees, library and university leadership must provide meaningful support for DEI, or library employees will become dismayed and experience low morale. Findings also indicate that while the institutional culture within one's library and university may be supportive of DEI work, threats to the promotion and tenure process could be a deterrent. Finally, respondents also reported overall comfortability in incorporating DEI work into their day-to-day lives. While the results are not generalizable to institutions outside of the parameters of the current study, this study sheds some perspective on the LIS community's response to DEI issues.","Geiger, Lauren","Mastley, Carrie P.","University Libraries, Mississippi State University, United States"

This study sought to analyze trends in inventor's gender for surgical device patents filed and granted in Canada and the United States from 2015 to 2019. This study analyzed patents filed and granted by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) in the category of ""Diagnosis; Surgery; Identification"" and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the category of ""Surgery"" from 2015 to 2019. The gender of the patent applicants was determined using a gender algorithm that predicts gender based on first names. Gender matches with names having a probability of less than 95% were excluded. We identified 14,312 inventors on patents filed and 12,737 inventors on patents granted by the CIPO for ""Diagnosis; Surgery; Identification"". In the USPTO category of ""Surgery,"" we identified 75,890 inventors on patents filed and 44,842 inventors on patents granted. Female inventors accounted for 7%-10% of inventors from 2015 to 2019 for both patents filed and granted. The proportion of female inventors on patents granted was significantly lower than for patents filed for four of the 5 y analyzed for both the USPTO and CIPO. Female representation in surgical device patenting has stagnated, between 7 and 10%, from 2015 to 2019 in Canada and the United States. This underrepresentation of female inventors in surgical device patenting represents sizable gender disparity.","Booth, Lindsay E.","Lo, Fu (Jorden)","Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada"

Methods: A survey was created with the input of both task force members as well as MLA professional staff. It was administered via SurveyMonkey and distributed through email over the course of two weeks in October 2019. Results: The demographics portion of the survey--beyond asking the usual questions about race or ethnicity (72% white), age (65% between 30 and 59), and so on--also asked questions that were more specific to diversity including, but not limited to, gender representation (79% female), sexuality (67% heterosexual), military service (97% have never served), ability (26% have anxiety sometimes or in certain situations), and college financial aid (49% used federal student loans). Diversity-specific questions asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the association: 59% strongly agreed or agreed that MLA has a strong commitment to DEI; 54% felt that the amount of time that association was spending on DEI issues was just about right; and 56% were very satisfied or satisfied with the DEI environment at MLA. Members also reported feeling like they belonged in MLA (59%), they were treated with respect (77%), and they were valued by MLA (59%) Conclusion: The survey paints a picture of the membership that is much deeper than any previously conducted membership survey. It shows the diversity of membership, especially in terms of ability and religion. Generally, the membership feels that MLA is right on target with the level of focus that MLA is giving issues of diversity. This survey reinforces the diversity work that has been done and supports diversity work in MLA in the future.","Pionke, J.

Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),2021,2,Gender Affirmative Action and Management: A Systematic Literature Review on How Diversity and Inclusion Management Affect Gender Equity in Organizations.,"Gender affirmative action (AA) in management remains a controversial topic among scholars, practitioners, and employees. While some individuals may support the use of AA policies as a means of increasing representation of women, others are not supportive at all, further understanding gender AA as an unacceptable violation of merit—even when targeted by it. With the aim of analyzing how scholars have approached the subject, we systematically reviewed 76 published articles (SCOPUS database), covering the extant literature on gender AA and management. Findings indicate a consensus regarding the common antecedents of attitudes towards gender AA with prior experiences with AA and diversity management (DM) (as well as general perceptions of AA). Performance and satisfaction appear as the predominant outcomes. In addition, while investigating the differences among AA, equal employment opportunity (EEO) and diversity management (DM), scholars are mainly focused on the effectiveness of AA as a means of increasing the inclusion of minorities in general. We conclude that despite marginal studies on employees' attitudes toward gender AA, there is a gap in the literature, particularly an absence of research on the bivalent position of meritocracy (or merit violation) as both an antecedent and outcome of attitudes towards AA, which deserves further scrutiny.","Furtado, Julia V.","Moreira, António C.","Departamento de Gestão e Economia, Universidade da Beira Interior, 6201-001 Covilhã, Portugal"

The behaviour of health scholars within academic institutions have far reaching influences on the health-related workforce, the nature of evidence, and the policy solutions within our collective imaginations. Progress on health equity requires moving beyond platitudes like 'equity, diversity and inclusion' statements and trainings towards actually being and doing differently within our day-to-day practices. Applying complex systems change theory to identify, examine and shift mental models, or habits of thought (and action), that are keeping us stuck in our efforts to advance health equity is a promising approach.

Journal of Park & Recreation Administration,2022,12,Exclusionary Effects of Campsite Allocation through Reservations in U.S. National Parks: Evidence from Mobile Device Location Data.,"Campsites represent highly sought after recreational amenities in the national parks of the United States. Equitable allocation of scarce recreational resources has long been a key management issue in U.S. national parks, but has become increasingly difficult in an era of increasing demand. At present, a growing number of national park campsites are allocated through an online reservation system well in advance of a camper's arrival at a park. Compounding the challenge of allocating these campsites is a long history of exclusivity within national park camping--institutionalized through campground design and predicated on a legacy of the leisure class's affinity for camping in national parks. Given national park camping's history of exclusivity, this exploratory study seeks to explore how online reservation systems may impact the demographics of national park campers. Using mobile device location data, estimated demographics were calculated for campers in five national park campgrounds in the U.S. that each contained some sites requiring reservations and some sites available on a first-come, first-served basis. We detail results from analyses of variance between campsites requiring reservations and those that are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Results suggest that for each of the five campgrounds, those campers camping in sites that require reservations came from areas with higher median household incomes, on average. In three of the five campgrounds, this difference was significant. Additionally, in an urban-proximate setting, those camping in sites requiring reservations came from areas with a higher portion of White residency than those campers in campsites not requiring reservations, on average. We conclude with discussion that includes management implications concerning the growing prominence of online reservation systems for outdoor recreation amenities, and a brief research agenda for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as they relate to campgrounds. Principally, the former group of implications includes the realization that online reservation systems present the unintended consequence of excluding low-income, and perhaps non-White, would-be campers--a conclusion drawn from the results of this exploratory study. This discussion includes an analysis of the distributive justice of online reservation systems.","Rice, William L.","Rushing, Jaclyn R.","Parks, Tourism, and Recreation Management Program, University of Montana, Missoula, MT"

UCLA Law Review,2022,11,Deadly Desires: The Juridical Birth of Queer Humanism Amidst Slavery's Afterlife.,"Black trans life has recently taken center stage in the liberal mind. The machine of diversity, equity, and inclusion has increased visibility of Black transness in a variety of arenas. We are now seen on red carpets, earn book deals, and play prominent roles in television shows and films. Yet the potential for our violation remains constitutive of our embodiments as we are coerced to interact with the World. As these co-constitutive inclusions and violations indicate, the affectual theatre of progress for Black trans people is in full swing. The embrace of impossibility may be the heftiest tool for legal scholars analyzing this paradoxical regime. How might the impossibility of Black vitality within U.S. juridical order lead us to a legal scholarship that insists on law's abandonment, toward a legal scholarship that properly situates the discourse of queer and trans rights in the hold of the ship, in the afterlife of slavery? Here the impositions of this impossibility take center stage, pushing beyond legal scholarship's deathridden love affair with political pragmatism, its retention of the nation state and, to quote Anthony Farley, its unanswered ""prayers for freedom."" This work primarily serves as a reflection of what reckoning with the figure of the human as an imposition on Black queer/trans vitality in legal discoursemay look like. I interrogate the historical progression of queer humanist legal changes, arriving at the careful and particular creation of a queer subject for whom human being is a possibility--particularly examining Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges. My reading of Lawrence v. Texas examines the unfolding of the legal ideology of the queer human, centering the horrifying slippage between queer desire and black ontological precarity as a necessary tool for the establishment of queer personhood via gay rights. Lawrence evidences the piecemeal process of creating state-worthy subjectivities, attending to the deathliness of queer sex by trapping it within the already established rubrics of monogamous home-oriented structures of sexual/romantic relations. Following that, Obergefell v. Hodges opens up the workings of legal precedent and the principle of harm, revealing the saliency of the human to their proper function. Here the piecemeal project continues, necessitating marriage to create vitality for the queer family. Finally, Bostock v.

Scientific Reports,2022,10,Adapting and pretesting the World Health Organization's Caregiver Skills Training Program for children with autism and developmental disorders or delays in Hong Kong.,"The World Health Organization Caregiver Skills Training Program (WHO-CST) was developed to strengthen caregivers' skills in supporting children with developmental delays and the caregivers' well-being. The WHO-CST Hong Kong (HK) was adapted, and pre-pilot tested to support families with children suspected of having developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder and to empower the caregivers to foster their children's learning, social communication, and adaptive behavior. A sequential mixed-methods research methodology was undertaken to examine the adaptation process and initial implementation experiences. The acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits of the WHO-CST were assessed using stakeholders' and caregivers' qualitative and caregivers' quantitative pre- and post-intervention feedback. The data included materials generated from (1) three consultation meetings with stakeholders; (2) detailed reviews of the translated and adapted WHO-CST materials by master trainees (n = 10) trained by the WHO-CST representatives; (3) needs assessment focus group interviews with caregivers (n = 15) of children with autism spectrum disorder; and (4) pre- and post-CST program qualitative focus group interviews and quantitative evaluation. Consultation with stakeholders suggested that the program was acceptable for the local community, but the home visit and fidelity components were initially considered to be challenges towards the feasibility and sustainability of the program. Caregivers in the needs assessment focus groups gave widely diverse views about the program's uniqueness, length, delivery mode, and the inclusion of videotaping in-home visits. Post-intervention comments by caregivers about the program were mainly positive, while the MTs were critical of the content and length of the training and fidelity process. As one of the first high-income locations to adopt the WHO-CST, the evaluation findings of the WHO-CST-HK indicate that it is feasible and acceptable to implement the program in a metropolitan area where families have busy work schedules and are very conscious of privacy issues. The study results suggest that the WHO-CST program in HK and other high-income countries require scaling up and further evaluation of its implementation in real community settings. This involves systemic and contextual changes to allow task-sharing between professionals and non-specialists at the macro level. Furthermore, technology should be used to support the supervision of non-specialists. In addition, easier access to the WHO-CST materials at the micro level is required to ensure equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion of diversified families of children with developmental delays.","Wong, Paul Wai-Ching","Lam, Yan-Yin","The Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Room 511, 5/F, The Jockey Club Tower, Centennial Campus, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China"

Cultural Trends,2019,12,Evaluating equity: assessing diversity efforts through a social justice lens.,"This paper provides a formative evaluation of The Art Institute of Chicago's initial efforts to diversify the museum field through the Diversifying Art Museum Leadership Initiative (DAMLI) programme. DAMLI is supported by the Walton Family Foundation and Ford Foundation as part of a movement to diversify the arts & cultural workforce in the United States. In Spring, 2018 the author was contracted to evaluate the museum-wide initiative to systematize and improve the experiences of high school, college, and graduate interns from demographic groups currently underrepresented in museum leadership fields. Through the use of [Fraser, N. (1995). Reframing justice in a globalizing world. New Left Review, 36, 1–19.] social justice framework, this paper will focus on the recruitment, selection, and management of internship experiences of the first four cohorts of undergraduate and graduate-level interns within the programme. The paper begins with an overview of recent diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the arts & cultural sector – highlighting the systemic issues leading to the need for such initiatives and presenting a typology for organisational responses to the issue. This paper then categorise the type of organisational change sought by The Art Institute of Chicago based on Fraser's two-dimensional social justice conditions and remedies framework in order to assess whether or not the Art Institute is achieving its goal of attracting, retaining, and empowering a diverse set of students and influencing their decision to pursue a career in the museum field by providing an equitable and inclusive environment during the internship. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of this work for arts and cultural organisations interested in diversifying the cultural workforce.","Heidelberg, Brea M.",,"Entertainment & Arts Management, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"

Irish Educational Studies,2022,3,Digital inclusion and accessibility considerations in digital teaching and learning materials for the second-level classroom.,"This article aims to explore the challenges associated with providing digital resources to stakeholders and identifying the obstacles and barriers to the successful design and exploitation of digital resources in the classroom and a wider learning environment. As a direct consequence of Covid-19 and the physical closure of schools we can now identify three specific content-producing cultures emerging within the educational community (Marcus-Quinn, A., T. Hourigan, and S. McCoy. 2019a. ""'The Digital Learning Movement: How Should Schools Respond?'."" Economic and Social Review 50 (4): 767–783). On the top tier we can see the independently developed resources by private educational companies that have been designed with accessibility hardwired into the resources. Such accessibility caters to the widest range of user needs. The second tier provides digital materials that have been produced by teachers in schools that have a 'tech-driven' agenda; such schools do not make it mandatory for teachers or students to use privately produced books. The third tier comprises teachers, outside of a formal community of practice, who use privately produced resources but modify them to suit their student needs better. There has been a rapid migration to digital learning as a direct response to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in schools (Mohan, G., S. McCoy, E. Carroll, G. Mihut, S. Lyons, and C. Mac Domhnaill. 2020. ""Learning for all? Second-level education in Ireland during COVID-19."" ESRI Survey and Statistical Report Series 92 June 2020.). As schools have scrambled to adapt to this ever-changing environment, digital inclusion has never been more critical as school communities now navigate these new learning experiences (Hall, Byrne et al. 2021; Marcus-Quinn, A., and T. Hourigan. 2021. Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open: Policy and Practice. Cham: Springer.; Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021a. ""Exploring the Ripple Effect of 'Always On'Digital Work Culture in Secondary Education Settings."" In Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open, edited by A. Marcus-Quinn and T. Hourigan, 339–353. Cham: Springer, Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021b. ""Technostress in Secondary Education Settings."" Coping with COVID: Advancing Education. The Naace Journal 89: 17–23). To comply with European legislation passed in 2019, public sector organisations and private companies and organisations need to check the accessibility of their websites, mobile apps, and media content (Oncins, E., and P. Orero. 2021. ""Let's put Standardisation in Practice: Accessibility Services and Interaction."" Hikma 20 (1): 71–90. https://www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/Planning/Digital-Learning-Framework-and-Planning-Resources-Post-Primary/Digital-Learning-Framework-for-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf). The educational publishing sector should also adhere to these common accessibility standards ensuring that digital content conforms to digital equity, diversity, and inclusion principles (Mihut, G., S. McCoy, and B. Maître. 2021. ""A Capability Approach to Understanding Academic and Socio-emotional Outcomes of Students with Special Educational Needs in Ireland."" Oxford Review of Education.). During the Covid-19 pandemic it became clear that there is an appetite for high-quality open-access digital teaching and learning materials (Eivers, E., J. Worth, and A. Ghosh. 2020. Home Learning During COVID-19: Findings from the Understanding Society Longitudinal Study. Slough: National Foundation for Educational Research.). To improve the consistency and reusability of such resources the education community would benefit from easy access to shared quality templates that are professionally designed and usability tested. Such an initiative is unlikely to happen without buy-in from publishers in conjunction with the Department of Education. Such collaboration was behind the successful establishment of Scoilnet: Ireland's national repository for shared digital teaching and learning materials. During the pandemic Scoilnet compiled a list to highlight the Open-access resources available to stakeholders and requested that teachers make recommendations and upload such resources to the Scoilnet portal. It is clear that such resources need to be designed and developed, and this requires professional time and resources. We cannot expect this to happen without cost.","Marcus-Quinn, Ann","Hourigan, Tríona","School of English, Irish, and Communication, University of Limerick, Castletroy, Limerick, Ireland"

This small-scale research explored five early childhood educators' understandings and experiences of inclusive education in two kindergartens in Victoria, Australia. A thematic analysis of the data highlights inclusion as a right to belong and fully participate; the need for modifications to orchestrate a culture of acceptance, diversity and inclusion; a lack of support and inadequate professional learning; and supporting effective practice through relationship with families, experts and children. The findings draw implications of evidencebased professional learning that is less focused on the interests of academic researchers and policy makers and more on the everyday needs of early childhood educators.","Munchan, Leanne","Agbenyega, Joseph","Monash University, Australia"

Recently, we observed some MEPAs creating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, positions, or committees. The purpose of this survey study was to examine the characteristics and formative experiences of the people leading these efforts. Survey participants (<italic>n</italic> = 62) were representative of the music educator profession in terms of gender. Regarding other characteristics, respondents were older, more educated, and more racially diverse than music educators as a group. Respondents were nearly all practicing music educators who taught a variety of content areas in PK–16 settings. Most did not feel prepared to lead DEI initiatives. While few respondents described their undergraduate education as relevant to DEI leadership, some named graduate education as an important formative experience. Respondents described life experiences as catalysts and preparation for leadership and indicated they taught themselves about DEI through reading, social media, and attending optional professional development. We discuss how these findings illustrate a leadership conundrum and exemplify structural issues in MEPA DEI action. We conclude with implications for teacher education and professional development.","Salvador, Karen","Sierzega, Amy","Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"

We established an Office of Health Equity and Inclusion (OHEI) at our pediatric academic medical center after a thorough evaluation of prior diversity initiatives and review of faculty development data. Objective: To describe the lessons learned at a pediatric academic medical center in prioritizing and implementing health equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) initiatives in creating the OHEI. Materials and methods: We reviewed internal administrative data and faculty development data, including data related to faculty who are underrepresented in medicine, to understand the role of our EDI initiatives in the strategic priorities addressed and lessons learned in the creation of the OHEI. Results: The intentional steps taken in our medical center's strategic approach in the creation of this office led to four important lessons to improve pediatric health equity: (1) board, senior executive and institutional prioritization of EDI initiatives; (2) multi-specialty and interprofessional collaboration; (3) academic approach to EDI programmatic development; and (4) intentionality with accountability in all EDI initiatives. Conclusion: The key lessons learned during the creation of an Office of Health Equity and Inclusion can provide guidance to other academic health centers committed to implementing institutional priorities that focus their EDI initiatives on the improvement of pediatric health equity.","Ward, Valerie L.","Tennermann, Nicole W.","Department of Radiology, Boston Children's Hospital, 300 Longwood Ave., 02115, Boston, MA, USA"

Methods: A survey was created with the input of both task force members as well as MLA professional staff. It was administered via SurveyMonkey and distributed through email over the course of two weeks in October 2019. Results: The demographics portion of the survey--beyond asking the usual questions about race or ethnicity (72% white), age (65% between 30 and 59), and so on--also asked questions that were more specific to diversity including, but not limited to, gender representation (79% female), sexuality (67% heterosexual), military service (97% have never served), ability (26% have anxiety sometimes or in certain situations), and college financial aid (49% used federal student loans). Diversity-specific questions asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the association: 59% strongly agreed or agreed that MLA has a strong commitment to DEI; 54% felt that the amount of time that association was spending on DEI issues was just about right; and 56% were very satisfied or satisfied with the DEI environment at MLA. Members also reported feeling like they belonged in MLA (59%), they were treated with respect (77%), and they were valued by MLA (59%) Conclusion: The survey paints a picture of the membership that is much deeper than any previously conducted membership survey. It shows the diversity of membership, especially in terms of ability and religion. Generally, the membership feels that MLA is right on target with the level of focus that MLA is giving issues of diversity. This survey reinforces the diversity work that has been done and supports diversity work in MLA in the future.","Pionke, J.

Public Integrity,2022,11,The Fruits of Diversity and Globalization: Participation and Contributions of East-Asian Scholars in Public Administration.,"The growth of East-Asian scholars in the American public affairs and administration (PA) field is increasingly apparent in recent years. Their participation demonstrates the diversity of the academic community and the globalization of higher education. However, little attention has been paid in the literature to this minority. From the broader perspective, Asian minorities have been overlooked in the discourse on diversity, equity, and inclusion, although they certainly confront social challenges such as inequity, injustice, discrimination, xenophobia, and even hate crimes. Our research attempts to address this gap in the literature by objectively documenting the participation and contributions of East-Asian scholars (EASs) to the American PA field. We find that across the top 100 PA schools, approximately 5% of the total full-time faculty members are East-Asian scholars, and that almost 20% of the peer-reviewed articles published in the top 10 PA journals are contributed by that scholarly community. However, the representation of East-Asian scholars in journal and association leadership teams remains low, which does not rise to their level of their contributions via peer-reviewed journal articles.","Zhang, Yahong","Holzer, Marc","School of Public Affairs and Administration, Rutgers University in Newark"
Public Integrity,2022,11,"The Racial Formation of Asian American Non-Profit Work in Orange County, California.","This article examines how a distinct racialized identity of Asian Americans is asserted through the work of ethnic non-profit organizations in Orange County, California. This area is home to the third-largest Asian American population in the United States but also has historically been seen as a suburban region with limited infrastructure to support ethnic communities. Using a regional racial formation theory framework, this study shows how diversity has been integral to understanding the Asian American identity, but that the regional context matters in how we define this pan-ethnic identity and its diversity. This narrative of diversity expressed by non-profit organization community leaders contribute to a re-articulation of an Asian American identity that underscores the distinct mix of Asian ethnic groups that contrasts with older urban immigrant gateways; challenges the model minority stereotype through mental health and anti-Asian discrimination advocacy; and emphasizes place and issue-based work that extends beyond their ethnic communities. The findings highlight how Asian American non-profit work provides lessons for broadly addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion in public administration practice.","Hom, Laureen D.",,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona"
Journal of Library Administration,2022,11,Understanding Disability to Support Library Workers.,"Libraries have pursued advancements in equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) for much of the last twenty years, but little has been done to address inaccessibility in the profession.

PLoS Biology,2022,10,Five actionable pillars to engage the next generation of leaders in the co-design of transformative ocean solutions.,"Solutions to complex and unprecedented global challenges are urgently needed. Overcoming these challenges requires input and innovative solutions from all experts, including Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). To achieve diverse inclusion from ECOPs, fundamental changes must occur at all levels—from individuals to organizations. Drawing on insights from across the globe, we propose 5 actionable pillars that support the engagement of ECOPs in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability: sharing knowledge through networks and mentorship, providing cross-boundary training and opportunities, incentivizing and celebrating knowledge co-design, creating inclusive and participatory governance structures, and catalyzing culture change for inclusivity. Foundational to all actions are the cross-cutting principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, the pillars are cross-boundary in nature, including collaboration and innovation across sectors, disciplines, regions, generations, and backgrounds. Together, these recommendations provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future. Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs) need to engage in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability. This Consensus View proposes five pillars to provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future.","Satterthwaite, Erin V.","Komyakova, Valeriya","California Sea Grant, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, California, United States of America"

Teaching of Psychology,2023,4,A Visionary Working Model for Pursuing Social Justice Praxis Through Educational Psychology Courses.,"Introduction: We propose a visionary working model to normalize the pursuit of social justice praxis in educational psychology courses. Using our undergraduate course as an example, we discuss our roles as instructors, curriculum, and pedagogical strategies for forward progress. Statement of the Problem: Despite stated commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion as integral to psychology research and practice (e.g., American Psychological Association statements), most educational psychology courses are highly theoretical and do not prepare learners to counter social injustices in praxis that are meaningful for the global majority. Literature Review: We make the case for why educational psychology courses are ideal for training students for social justice praxis, and outline how diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies in the literature can be used as levers. Teaching Implications: We provide assignment resources to illustrate how instructors can begin to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout a course to co-construct more just futures. Conclusion: Actualizing this visionary model of normalizing social justice praxis in educational psychology courses requires multi-level supports at global and local levels. Using case studies to address complex social injustices within an engaged teaching and learning environment has significant potential to empower and prepare learners to forward social justice.","Mustafaa, Faheemah N.","Martinez, Mayra Nuñez","School of Education, 8789 University of California, Davis, CA, USA"
American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education,2022,6,Engaging in Authentic Allyship as Part of Our Professional Development.,"Educational institutions increasingly recognize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to combat and dismantle structures that sustain inequities. However, successful DEI work hinges on individuals being authentic allies and incorporating allyship into their professional development. Allyship involves members of dominant groups recognizing their privilege and engaging in actions to create inclusivity and equitable spaces for all. Individuals from dominant groups with desires to actively support others from marginalized groups are often unsure how to fight oppression and prejudice. Our goal as faculty with diverse perspectives and heterogeneous intersectional identities is to provide readers with the tools to develop as an authentic ally through educating themselves about the identities and experiences of others, challenging their own discomfort and prejudices, dedicating the time and patience to learning how to be an ally, and taking action to promote change toward personal, institutional, and societal justice and equality. Ultimately, each person must advocate for change because we all hold the responsibility. When everyone is an authentic ally, we all thrive and rise together.","Arif, Sally","Afolabi, Titilola","Midwestern University, College of Pharmacy-Downers Grove, Downers Grove, Illinois"

This exploratory study examined informal science educators' perspectives on workforce equity, diversity, and professionalization. Through a nationwide survey and selective interviews, educators (n = 132) were asked about their career motivations and personal and professional challenges faced before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that 59% of informal science educators surveyed were considering academic or career changes, citing workplace practices and cultures that perpetuate overwork and underpay and that have contributed to the marginalization of educators who have been historically excluded from working in the field. Our goal is to amplify educators' voices and encourage reflection on how museums and other institutions have upheld oppressive structures that prevent goals of equity, diversity, and inclusion from being holistically achieved.","Rende, Kathryn","Fromson, K.",
International Journal of Eating Disorders,2022,4,Reporting racial and ethnic diversity in eating disorder research over the past 20 years.,"Objective: Recent public awareness of racial and ethnic disparities has again brought to light issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the eating disorders field. However, empirical information on racial and ethnic representation in eating disorders research is limited, making it difficult to understand where improvements are needed. Method: This study reviewed all studies including human participants published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Differences in likelihood of reporting race and ethnicity were calculated based on study year, location, and diagnostic categories. Results: Out of 377 manuscripts, 45.2% reported information on the race and ethnicity of study participants. Studies conducted in the United States were more likely to report (128/173), and those conducted in Europe were less likely to report (5/61) on race and ethnicity than those conducted outside of those regions. Rates of reporting increased from 2000 to 2020. White participants made up approximately 70% of the samples that reported race and ethnicity data. Hispanic participants made up approximately 10% of samples reporting race and ethnicity. Participants from all other races and ethnicities made up less than 5% each. Discussion: Although rates of reporting race and ethnicity increased over time, most participants were White. Rates of reporting also differed by the geographical region, which may reflect variability in how information on race and ethnicity is collected across countries. More attention toward capturing the cultural background of research participants and more inclusivity in research are needed in the eating disorders field.","Egbert, Amy H.","Hunt, Rowan A.","Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Miriam Hospital/Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence Rhode Island,, USA"

Medical Teacher,2019,4,Inclusion in the clinical learning environment: Building the conditions for diverse human flourishing.,"Aim: While diversity, equity, and inclusion are much proclaimed aspirational goals in education programs, the clinical learning environment (CLE) frequently falls short of meaningful incorporation of these concepts in processes, policies, and local culture. In this paper, we explore how inclusion, diversity, and equity can and should be defined and operationalized within medical education. Methods: Three cases, organized around Hafferty's curricular framework (formal, informal, and hidden), we illustrate lapses and potential best practices in inclusion in the CLE. Results: The essential ""best-practice"" of programs inclusive of diverse individuals is the design of policies, processes, and behavioral norms co-creatively with all community members. Potential pitfalls to greater inclusion include nostalgic reference to ""the past"", a neutrality that is operationalized without the rudder of explicit values and not recognizing that ethical obligations between teachers, learners, and programs are at the heart of the discussion of how inclusive learning and work environments are built. Conclusion: Inclusive CLE's provide space for co-creation, understand the need to ensure the voices of the vulnerable (i.e. learners) are heard and valued and through this promote the flourishing of diverse human capital, in keeping with a model that views diversity as a key attribute or organizational excellence.","Razack, Saleem","Philibert, Ingrid","Pediatrics, Centre for Medical Education, and Office of Social Accountability and Community Engagement, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"

Journal of Forensic Sciences,2023,1,Forensic archeology as a high‐impact practice.,"High‐impact practices (HIPs) are educational modalities that focus on experiential and deep learning to affect student success in higher education, particularly among students matriculating from historically underserved communities. HIPs are designed to provide students with the intellectual and practical skills to succeed in an increasingly unstable global world beyond college. Utilizing a private‐public partnership forensic archeological contract project, this paper examines how this venture employed a HIP‐based contractor model that hired students as a professional archeological field crew and provided them with a living wage, transportation, and room and board. It also provided students without the means to participate in international fieldwork with the wherewithal to do so, supporting underserved students and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. Utilizing this HIP‐based contract model resulted in greater student investment and collaboration in a fieldwork situation more akin to the real world, where students learned to solve problems, communicate, and network in an international setting, resulting in new opportunities, such as professional jobs, and academic projects and publications. The paid contractor model ensured students with limited resources could participate, broadening the type of student who can receive this type of training, expanding diversity in forensic anthropology. These models are not limited to forensic archeological fieldwork; they can also be applied to forensic anthropology laboratory projects. Utilizing HIPs and employing a more equitable contractor model contributes to student professionalization, strengthens professional prospects beyond the university, and contributes to DEIB initiatives, all of which benefit forensic anthropology as a subdiscipline.","Kolpan, Katharine E.","Passalacqua, Nicholas V.","Department of Culture, Society and Justice, University of Idaho, Moscow Idaho,, USA"

BioScience,2023,5,Sexual harassment disproportionately affects ecology and evolution graduate students with multiple marginalized identities in the United States.,"Sexual harassment within academic institutions has profound impacts that may lead to the attrition of groups historically excluded from the biological sciences and related disciplines. To understand sexual harassment's effects on vulnerable communities within academia, we examined graduate student experiences with sexual harassment. In a survey of ecology and evolutionary biology programs across the United States, we found that 38% of the graduate student respondents were sexually harassed during their time in these programs. Sexual harassment disproportionately affected graduate students with multiple intersecting marginalized identities, and these experiences led to delays in completing graduate programs and shifts away from their desired careers. Our research highlights the need for academic institutions, and science more broadly, to make widespread changes to sexual harassment policies, including treating sexual harassment as scientific misconduct and creating resources for individuals within students' informal support networks, in tandem with efforts to dismantle barriers to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.","Wilkins, Kate","Carroll, Sarah L","Denver Zoo's Field Conservation Department and Department of Biology, Colorado State University (CSU) , Fort Collins, Colorado, USA"
JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine,2023,4,Religious Identity Discrimination in the Physician Workforce: Insights from Two National Studies of Muslim Clinicians in the US.,"Background: Discrimination negatively impacts physician career trajectories and well-being. Objective: Quantify perceived religious discrimination among US Muslim physicians and compare trends over time. Design/Participants/Main Measures: Two national surveys tabulated discrimination. The 2013 survey involved a mailed questionnaire to a random sample of 746 Islamic Medical Association of North America (IMANA) members, while the 2021 survey was administered online to subscribers of IMANA, American Muslim Health Professionals, and the US Muslim Physician network. Eligible participants had to be practicing US Muslim physicians, and English-proficient (the 2021 sample was further restricted to physicians in academic medicine). Questionnaires assessed experiences of religious discrimination and accommodation. Key Results: In 2013, the 255 participants had a mean age of 52 years, were mostly male (70%), Sunni (91%), South Asian (70%), and adult immigrants (65%). In 2021, the 264 participants had a mean age of 39.5 years, were mostly male (65%) and Sunni (75%). In contrast to 2013, the majority were born in the USA (59%; p<0.01), and respondents were more diverse with 33% South Asians, 22% Arabs, and 16% African Americans. Greater proportions of the 2021 sample reported facing religious discrimination frequently in their career (24 to 53%; p<0.01), experiencing job turnover (7 to 32%; p<0.01), and having patients refuse their care (9 to 33%; p<0.01). A higher proportion of South Asians, Arabs, and participants under the age of 40 reported discrimination and job turnover in 2021 when compared to 2013. Higher proportions of South Asians and Whites reported being passed over for professional advancement and having patients refuse their care in 2021 relative to 2013. Conclusions: Many American Muslim clinicians encounter religious discrimination at the workplace, and these experiences appear to be on the rise. Healthcare workforce diversity, inclusion, and equity programming should include a focus on accommodating the religious identities of physicians.","Baqai, Benish","Azam, Laila","Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"
Canadian Public Policy,2023,3,Igniting an Intersectional Shift in Public Policy Research (and Training).,"Throughout the 2010s, a major focus of public policy and public policy debates was about understanding the sources of inequality and understanding the role of government in addressing income inequality. While progress has been made, significant gaps in inequality remain—gaps that go well beyond income inequality and that were emphasized throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The experiences of the pandemic have served as a reminder that individuals in society have distinct experiences, and that attention to inequality and diversity needs to be seriously incorporated into modernized policy frameworks. As governments commit to a fair recovery from COVID-19 amid a broad desire for a more just society, a more inclusive approach to policy analysis is required to address longstanding failures in the economy and society. Modernized policy frameworks need to be more representative of and attentive to the experiences and struggles of marginalized and underrepresented populations. Intersectionality is an analytical tool rooted in the social justice paradigm that makes clear the links between notions of identity and the systems of power through which they play out. Intersectionality considers the ways in which our identities are formed at the intersections of various social constructs, such as race, ability, class, and gender, and within broader contexts and structures of power, such as the labour market and government institutions. Fully integrating intersectionality into policy analysis could create a policy analysis structure that would advance policy agendas of diversity, inclusion, and equity.","Tedds, Lindsay M.",,"Department of Economics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada"
Social Sciences (2076-0760),2023,3,Terminology and Language Used in Indigenous-Specific Gender and Sexuality Diversity Studies: A Systematic Review.,"Cultural responsivity in academic research is central to the use of language that is representative and inclusive of Indigenous worldviews on gender and sexuality diversity. This article uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach to explore current studies' contribution to the use of gender and sexuality diverse terminology and language that is representative of Indigenous worldviews. A systematic review of 85 journal articles (published between January 2000 and June 2021) generates both quantitative results regarding the frequency of terms used and qualitative outcomes of actively used terminologies, geographic regions, identified populations, and gender and sexuality diversity-specific themes in Indigenous studies. A substantial glossary of terminology characteristic of the multiplicity of gender and sexuality diversity was identified, however, further research examining gender and sexuality diversity from the perspective of Indigenous worldviews is needed to align with the best practices of equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging.","Fox, Michael J.","Wu, Haorui","School of Social Work, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada"
Vanderbilt Law Review,2022,1,Duty and Diversity.,"In the wake of the brutal deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, lawmakers and corporate boards from Wall Street to the West Coast have introduced a slew of reforms aimed at increasing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (""DEI"") in corporations. Yet the reforms face difficulties ranging from possible constitutional challenges to critical limitations in their scale, scope, and degree of legal obligation and practical effects. In this Article, we provide an old answer to the new questions facing DEI policy and offer the first close examination of how corporate law duties impel and facilitate corporate attention to diversity. Specifically, we show that corporate fiduciaries are bound by their duties of loyalty to take affirmative steps to make sure that corporations comply with important civil rights and antidiscrimination laws and norms designed to ensure fair access to economic opportunity. We also show how corporate law principles like the business judgment rule do not just authorize, but indeed encourage American corporations to take effective action to reduce racial and gender inequality and increase inclusion, tolerance, and diversity given the rational basis that exists connecting good DEI practices, corporate reputation, and sustainable firm value. By both incorporating requirements to comply with key antidiscrimination laws and enabling corporate DEI policies that go well beyond the legal minimum, corporate law offers critical tools with which corporations may address DEI goals that other reforms do not--and that can embed a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of corporate interactions with employees, customers, communities, and society generally. The question, therefore, is not whether corporate leaders can take effective action to help reduce racial and gender inequality--but will they?.","Brummer, Chris","Strine Jr., Leo E.","Agnes N.

Quality Assurance in Education: An International Perspective,2016,10,"Promoting social equity, diversity, and inclusion through accreditation.","Purpose This purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which accreditation of public affairs programs can be a tool to advance social equity, diversity, and inclusion. The paper is presented in the context of the widespread acceptance of the importance of addressing social inequalities in Latin America and the critical role that public policy and public administration can have on advancing these goals.Design/methodology/approach International and national accreditation standards are compared using content analysis for their reference to social equity and diversity in their standards regarding faculty, students, curriculum content and learning outcomes. The research applies content analysis of key documents and thematic coding.Findings International accrediting agencies that focused explicitly on programs in public affairs place a much greater emphasis on social equity and diversity than their national counterparts which accredit a full range of programs and institutions. National accrediting agencies assert the value of diversity, but their standards and reporting requirements suggest otherwise.Research limitations/implications The research suggests that international accreditation standards have the potential to advance social equity goals more effectively than national standards and that there is great potential to enhance this component of national accreditation standards. Implications for policymakers, accreditation professionals and scholars are identified.Originality/value The research is original in its focus on the role of accreditation in promoting social equity and its comparison of national and international standards. Although limited to Latin America and public affairs programs, the research provides a basis for examining similar patterns with respect to other disciplines and professions, and in other regions of the world.","Rubaii, Nadia",,"Department of Public Administration, College of Community and Public Affairs, Binghamton University, State University of New York, New York, USA"
Journal of Multilingual & Multicultural Development,2023,2,Teaching English in challenging situations: interviews with those in the trenches.,"The conviction that language education should serve as a means to promote equity, inclusion, and diversity has spread around educators worldwide. In this light, even though humanistic approaches to language teaching are not new (Stevick 1990), the past two decades have shown a growing interest in such approaches as they offer the possibility to articulate the teaching of linguistic competence with social justice values, interculturality, and with ways of enhancing the wellbeing of individuals and communities (e.g. Glynn, Wesely, and Wassell 2014; Gregersen, MacIntyre, and Meza 2016; Hastings and Jacob 2016; Oxford et al. 2021). Teaching languages through a social justice lens is of paramount significance in extremely challenging situations, including areas affected by war. This article is based on interviews done to Nick Bilbrough and Chris Sowton about their influential work associated with the teaching of English in challenging contexts. The article presents the interviews and makes reference to important themes that include the difficulty to implement pedagogies that favour equity, inclusion, and diversity in the language classroom due to the prevailing instrumental view of language education worldwide; humanistic, intercultural teaching approaches that should be favoured in the language classroom; and the importance of teacher wellbeing to support learner wellbeing.","Olivero, María Matilde",,Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto

Journal of Map & Geography Libraries,2022,1,Data Visualization and Advocacy for Sexual and Gender Minority Health.,"Data visualizations can be a powerful way to educate and advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Teaching data visualization concepts and data literacy skills around a specific topic can be particularly impactful. This paper presents an approach to data visualization and advocacy centered around the issue of sexual and gender minority health. Not only are we witnessing continuous attacks on LGBTQIA + rights in the United States, in the healthcare setting, the needs of LGBTQIA + patients are often not met due to the insufficient training of healthcare providers. There is a need to better understand the health challenges and barriers that sexual gender minority patients face, and to advocate for these patients both inside and outside of the healthcare setting. This paper explains some of these health challenges and barriers and offers a pedagogical approach for DEI advocacy that is based in critical map and data librarianship, and social justice advocacy. The article presents a lesson plan that combines data literacy and data visualization concepts with community needs assessments—such as walking and windshield surveys – thereby proposing a way for educators to advocate for marginalized people.","Mueller, Janina",,"Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts, USA"

Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal,2023,2,Workforce Diversity of Interventional Radiology Physicians in North America: Reflections on the U.S. Experience.,"Achieving parity in representation within the field of Interventional Radiology (IR) across women and specific subsets of minority groups has been a challenge. The lack of a strongly diverse physician workforce in gender, race, and ethnicity suggests suboptimal recruitment after, during as well prior to IR training. There is a dearth of studies which effectively characterize the national demographic trends of the evolving IR workforce. This has prevented an accurate appraisal of continuing efforts to narrow the gaps in physician workforce diversity across the field of IR. To support these needs, this article illustrates historic trends while providing contemporary data that canvasses the status of diversity within the current IR physician and IR trainee workforce. It highlights the representation of those individuals historically underrepresented in medicine as well as women. It also highlights current obstacles to achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion within the field of IR as well as existing efforts that have been employed to mitigate this gap.","Higgins, Mikhail C.

SAGE Open,2022,10,A Comparative Analysis of Data Quality in Online Zoom Versus Phone Interviews: An Example of Youth With and Without Disabilities.,"Qualitative researchers are increasingly using online data collection methods, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I compared the data quality (i.e., interview duration, average number of themes and sub-themes, and inaudible words) of 34 interviews (29 conducted by Zoom (16 with camera on, 13 camera off) and 5 conducted by phone) drawn from a study focusing on youth's coping experiences during the pandemic. Findings showed that phone interviews had a longer duration compared to Zoom. However, phone interviews had a similar average word count to Zoom interviews (with the camera on). Zoom interviews conducted with the camera off were shorter in duration than interviews with the camera on. The number of themes was similar across the different interview formats but there were fewer sub-themes for Zoom interviews with the camera off. The findings suggest that Zoom interviews conducted with the camera off could affect the data quality. This research also emphasizes the importance of giving participants choice in the format of their interview to allow for optimal sharing of experiences while enhancing the equity, diversity and inclusion of the participants.","Lindsay, Sally",,"University of Toronto, ON, Canada"

Data Sources and Study Setting: Interviews were conducted with Muslim physicians from three US‐based Muslim clinician organizations between June and August 2021. Study Design: In‐depth, semi‐structured qualitative interviews used a phenomenological approach to describe experiences of religious discrimination and accommodation. A team‐based framework approach to coding was used to inductively generate themes from interview data. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Physicians from the Islamic Medical Association of North America, American Muslim Health Professionals, and the US Muslim Physicians group were invited to participate using closed organizational listservs. Inclusion criteria sought English‐speaking, self‐identifying Muslims with current or past affiliation with a university hospital in the United States. Potential participants were segmented into groups based on responses to questions about perceived religious discrimination and accommodation. Purposive sampling was used to iteratively approach participants within these groups in order to capture a diverse respondent pool. Interviews stopped after thematic saturation was reached. Principal Findings: Eighteen physicians (11 women and 7 men; mean age: 41.5 [standard deviation = 12.91] years) were interviewed. Nearly all (n = 16) held Islam to be important in their lives. Three overarching themes, with several subthemes, emerged. Participants (1) struggled to maintain religious practices and observances due to unaccommodating organizational structures; (2) experienced religious discrimination, which, in turn, impacted their professional trajectories and, at times, their personal well‐being; and (3) believed that institutions could implement specific educational and policy interventions to advance the religious accommodation of Muslims in health care. Conclusions: Muslim physicians frequently encounter religious discrimination, yet there are concrete ways in which health care workplaces can better accommodate their religious needs and combat discrimination. To improve workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion, educational forums and policies that support the religious practices of physicians need to be established.","Padela, Aasim I.","Azam, Laila","Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Wisconsin,, USA"
International Journal of Eating Disorders,2022,4,Accountability in promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders field: A call to action.,"Promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders (EDs) field among professionals and the populations studied and served has long been discussed, with limited progress. This may be due to a reinforcing feedback loop in which individuals from dominant cultures conduct research and deliver treatment, participate in research, and receive diagnoses and treatment. This insularity maintains underrepresentation: EDs in historically marginalized populations are understudied, undetected, and undertreated. An Early Career Investigators Workshop generated recommendations for change that were not inherently novel but made apparent that accountability is missing. This paper serves as a call to action to spearhead a paradigm shift from equality to equity in the ED field. We provide a theoretical framework, suggest ways to disrupt the feedback loop, and summarize actionable steps to increase accountability in ED leadership and research toward enhancing racial/ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). These actionable steps are outlined in the service of challenging our field to reflect the diversity of our global community. We must develop and implement measurable metrics to assess our progress toward increasing diversity of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and to address JEDI issues in our providers, patients, and research participants.","Goel, Neha J.","Jennings Mathis, Karen","Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond Virginia,, USA"

Finally, I applaud the students who serve on the Utah Law Review ®r their vigilance in using the power of scholarship, convening, and discourse to generate knowledge and inspire action that will be meaningful to our teaching and learning communities as we tackle the perennial issue of systemic racial inequality and intersectional injustice.

The./bcus on legal education, the legal academy, and the legal profession is necessary for two reasons: jirst, throughout history, the law has been used to design a system that has and continues to advantage some and to oppress others in American society: and second, the special duty of those within the legal profession is to lise the law as a tool to promote democracy and democratic ideals. not to diminish or dismantle them. As such, this Essay proposes the use of antiracism in teaching, learning, and practice to acknowledge the persistence of systemic racial inequality and intersectional injustice, to become competent in using pedagogy and practice to prepare methods of resisting systemic racial inequality and intersectional initslice, and to act to embed antiracism into our democratic institutions to promote systemic equity.","Conway, Danielle M.",,"Dean and Donald J.

Public Integrity,2022,7,Integrating Mindfulness in Public and Nonprofit Education Programs to Foster Social Equity.,"As a discipline, the path forward for Public Administration from its role in creating, maintaining, and perpetuating systemic racism and social inequities is to promote social equity as part of the 4Es—engagement, empathy, equity, and ethics. This article proposes a fusion of mindfulness with the treatment of social equity, diversity, and inclusion (SEDI) in public and nonprofit administration as a promising strategy for improving the training of professionals to be competent in social equity. The goal is to encourage faculty to incorporate mindfulness principles and practices in their pedagogy, course design, course policies, and course activities in ways that foster mindfulness and social equity. To meet this challenge, faculty will need to (1) identify and reflect on the guiding principles of the field, and (2) incorporate mindful awareness in how professional values are conveyed by faculty within a subject matter where the intent is not to and the impact does not result in (a) alienating, shaming, or oppressing those with uninformed and/or stereotypical deeply held ideologies, while (b) simultaneously challenging students to intentionally tackle difficult conversations and ideologies.","Irizarry, Jose Luis",,University of Illinois Springfield
American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,2022,7,Inequity in Peer Review in Communication Sciences and Disorders.,"Purpose: The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by retaining and advancing Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) individuals in the discipline of communication sciences and disorders (CSD), amid critical shortages of faculty to train the next generation of practitioners and researchers. Publishing research is central to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of faculty. However, inequity in peer review may systematically target BIPOC scholars, adding yet another barrier to their success as faculty. This viewpoint article addresses the challenge of inequity in peer review and provides some practical strategies for developing equitable peer-review practices. First, we describe the demographics of ASHA constituents, including those holding research doctorates, who would typically be involved in peer review. Next, we explore the peerreview process, describing how inequity in peer review may adversely impact BIPOC authors or research with BIPOC communities. Finally, we offer realworld examples of and a framework for equitable peer review. Conclusions: Inequity at the individual and systemic levels in peer review can harm BIPOC CSD authors. Such inequity has effects not limited to peer review itself and exerts long-term adverse effects on the recruitment, retention, and advancement of BIPOC faculty in CSD. To uphold ASHA's commitment to DEI and to move the discipline of CSD forward, it is imperative to build equity into the editorial structure for publishing, the composition of editorial boards, and journals content. While we focus on inequity in CSD, these issues are relevant to other disciplines.","Girolamo, Teresa M.","Castro, Nichol","Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs"

However, these groups face unique challenges to engage in and benefit from these interventions, and apps that consider issues of diversity , equity , and inclusion (DEI) may be better positioned to reach them. App evaluation frameworks emerge as crucial tools for researchers, clinicians, and users to select evidence-based apps. Nevertheless, it is unclear the extent to which existing assessment tools capture DEI factors. The present scoping review identified 68 studies that employed one or more assessment tools to evaluate a mental health app, leading to 44 unique app evaluation frameworks. Results showed that most frameworks were developed after 2015, and only 58% of them considered at least one DEI criterion. Frameworks that performed exceptionally well were those that combined multiple standardized and validated measures. This lack of consideration for DEI variables may limit the ability of app-based interventions to serve marginalized communities, or even worse, create new disparities. Therefore, we provide recommendations to improve current app evaluation frameworks' cultural robustness and clinical utility, maximizing their effectiveness when working with individuals from marginalized communities. • First scoping review examining DEI criteria in mental health app evaluation frameworks. • Only 58% of frameworks consider at least one DEI criterion. • Several widely used frameworks had minimal to no DEI criteria. • Recommendations are provided to improve the frameworks' cultural robustness.","Ramos, Giovanni","Ponting, Carolyn","Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"

International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft,2021,12,Fostering diversity work as a process of lifelong learning: A partnership case study with an immigrant services organisation.,"Diversity work is an area of growing interest for organisations in both the private and public sectors. In a nutshell, the term refers to the work conducted within an organisation that promotes inclusive and equitable engagement with people and communities across social differences such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and religion. Related research has generated relatively more knowledge about the challenges and problems of diversity initiatives than about effective practices that genuinely foster social equity and inclusion. This article contributes to the latter with a partnership case study involving the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.), a large non-profit immigrant services organisation headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Specifically, the study presented here focuses on the organisational practices that are constitutive of frontline workers' engagement with diversity work and learning. It shows that (1) building a diverse and inclusive organisation, (2) supporting continuous learning opportunities at work, and (3) providing diversity training, both directive and generative, form the organisation's diversity ""curriculum"". This study also demonstrates that the strength of this workplace curriculum is that it has the potential to challenge the boundary between instrumentalism (harnessing diversity work to business success) and equity activism (prioritising diversity work in its own right), and that it creates space for collective reflection in the presence of others. Conceptually drawing on the practice turn in social sciences, particularly Steven Billet and Jennifer Newton's learning practice, and what David Boud terms ""the reflective turn"", this article positions diversity work as a reflective and iterative process of lifelong learning for both organisations and individual workers.","Shan, Hongxia","Cheng, Amy","Department of Educational Studies, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"

Literacy,2023,5,Working towards more socially just futures: five areas for transdisciplinary literacies research.,"Policy‐makers and provincial governments have a responsibility to prioritise equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (EDIA) with approaches that leverage both intersectionality and transdisciplinarity, especially when looking at literacies research. Supported by a federally funded knowledge synthesis grant that surveyed the scope of EDIA in Canadian schools, this article focuses on youth marginalisation to address literacies learning. The authors address five concepts from a three‐phase literature review to examine inclusive practices that respect, acknowledge and address EDIA in K‐12 education. Across reviewed studies, there is an underlying trajectory outlining methodological challenges in implementing EDIA practices. We advance anti‐racist and abolitionist approaches by addressing five areas: (1) making learning more accessible by adopting culturally responsive pedagogy informed by local cultures, languages and values; (2) pursuing sustainable professional development in culturally inclusive teaching practices; (3) creating safer school environments that nurture community‐driven relationships between parents, students and their teachers; (4) reforming educational policies to concretely address structural racism, discrimination and misrepresentation of socially marginalised students by disrupting what is conceptualised and accepted as ideal culturally responsive pedagogy; and (5) prioritising community perspectives and input curriculum decisions to support underrepresented students. Ultimately, this article echoes this issue's orientations as it explores transdisciplinary practices composing an evolving understanding of literacies.","Lemieux, Amélie","Boyle, Lisa","Faculty of Education, University of Montreal"
Journal of Latinos & Education,2023,4,Got Cultural Citizenship? A Place-Based and Socio-Historical Analysis of Postsecondary Students’ Cultural Logics and Values at a Land Grant Institution in Southern New Mexico.,"Using data from a 2013 Student Diversity Survey, this place-based analysis examines the cultural values, beliefs, and logics of postsecondary students from an Hispanic Land Grant Institution in southern New Mexico. The analysis explores the diverse social profiles of the students in the sample and how race, gender, and class statuses shape student’s cultural logics related to educational democracy. Relying on the concepts of cultural citizenship and settler colonialism, the author imagines a post-assimilationist education trajectory that celebrates the cultural wealth of working-class, students of color, and women students as they diversify US higher education. The findings show that these postsecondary students embrace cultural logics centering on interdependence and collectivism and reject cultural logics centering on individualism and independence. The author makes a case for expanding neoliberal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion approaches in US higher education to grapple with the foundational violences of Indigenous land dispossession and ongoing settler colonialism that maintains systemic inequities and exclusions in US public education.","Pelak, Cynthia Fabrizio",,New Mexico State University
Journal of Cutaneous Pathology,2023,4,Demographics and perceptions of diversity in dermatopathology workforce and training environments in the United States.,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the demographics and perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the field of dermatopathology to provide a measurable baseline for future efforts to enhance equity measures within our subspecialty. Methods: A questionnaire based on a previously validated instrument by Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) was sent to American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) members to collect the demographic information (gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, experience and practice setting, etc.) and evaluate eight diversity, engagement, and inclusivity statements on a 1–5 Likert scale. Results: The demographics of 207 of 1331 (15%) respondents showed slight male predominance. Eleven percent of respondents identified as LGBTQI. The major racial distribution was comprised of 62% White, 18% Asian (including Middle Eastern/Indian), 10% Hispanic, and 4% Black respondents. New‐in‐practice respondents (those in practice—5 years or less) were more likely to have a pathology background (71% vs. 56%, p = 0.047) than their more‐established peers with more than 5 years of service. This trend also contributed to increased diversity in terms of gender (66% females) and race (48% non‐White) among the newer generation. Dermatology‐trained dermatopathologists were mostly White (70%) and male (53%). Analysis of respondent demographics with perception statements showed that White and US graduate respondents (compared to other groups) were more likely to have a positive perception about DEI within the field of dermatopathology. Conclusions: The results provide a snapshot of the current state of diversity within the field of dermatopathology. Moreover, these results highlight opportunities for further increasing diversity in general and leadership in particular within dermatopathology.","Ahmed, Aadil","Gittens, Brian E.","Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock Arkansas,, USA"
Interactive Learning Environments,2023,3,Differentiated instruction in digital video games: STEM teacher candidates using technology to meet learners’ needs.,"Differentiated instruction (DI) is a teaching approach that aims to achieve learning for diverse students. This study reports on promoting STEM teacher candidates’ (TCs’) implementation of technology-enhanced DI in teacher education courses. The research questions are: (1) How do TCs develop digital video games (DVGs) to be inclusive of DI?, and (2) If, and to what extent are DVGs effective tools to implement DI in secondary science classes? The analysis of eight DVGs, developed by the TCs, shows that most TCs were able to proficiently integrate DI practices in their DVGs. Furthermore, DVGs are effective tools to differentiate instruction by facilitating pacing variation for different students, differentiating difficulty levels, scaffolding, integrating multimodalities to present the content in different formats, utilizing engaging features, representing different learners of various backgrounds, promoting conceptual understanding, and enabling different assessment forms especially formative and diagnostic assessments. This research is significant as it highlights how digital resources such as DVGs can be used to address individual learners’ needs, interests, profiles, and academic achievement levels. Additionally, this research informs instructional designers, game developers, and curriculum specialists on ways to incorporate equity, diversity, and inclusion pedagogies such as DI in digital educational resources.","Estaiteyeh, Mohammed","DeCoito, Isha",Brock University

Journal of Business & Psychology,2023,2,A Call to Action: Six Anti-Black Racism Topics Practitioners Encourage Researchers to Investigate.,"Anti-Black racism within the workplace has been negatively associated with psychological well-being, belonging, pay equity, and creativity (Neal-Barnett, Harvard Business Review, 2021; Tucker, SHRM, 2021). Moreover, after the deaths of George Floyd and countless other Black Americans, anti-Black racism has become a topic that has garnered international attention and demanded reformation of organizational culture (see Boykin et al., Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 2020). During a time when academic research on these topics is still in their nascent stages, we have assembled a team of practitioners to offer advice on what we believe are some of the most critical topics to tackle. These issues are not only ones that we—as Black individuals—personally feel are critical. But additionally, we—as practitioners who have had experiences in a wide scope of organizational settings—feel they are under challenges that simply must be addressed through empirical research, which is currently lacking. Our ""call to action"" focuses on these six key topics: (1) avoiding short-term solutions to a long-term problem; (2) maximizing the effectiveness of diversity, equity, and inclusion officers; (3) engaging White men as allies; (4) ensuring fairer selection systems for hiring; (5) effectively leveraging diversity, equity, and inclusion data; and (6) leveraging employee resource groups as critical business drivers. After discussing each section, we provide recommendations regarding what we believe need empirical attention, attention we believe is key to ultimately mitigate anti-Black racism in the workplace.","McCleary-Gaddy, Asia T.","Smith, Casey C.","University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 6431 Fannin St., MSB G.300F, 77030, Houston, TX, USA"

This project uses diversity ideology as a framework to examine how proposals for Amazon’s second headquarters (HQ2) reflect applicants’ beliefs and value systems around racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion. In our sample of 70 proposals, respondents layered four primary tactics: disregard, limited engagement, acknowledgment without culpability, and value claiming. Prominent approaches included avoidance of any discussion of diversity, objectification of racial and ethnic minority populations as an economic or cultural input, and the assertion a racially and ethnically diversity workforce is an attainable goal while utilizing stereotypes. Each of these approaches reflects different ways racial and ethnic minority populations remain marginalized within economic development proposals, even when firms actively solicit information on their presence and support.","Spurlock, Danielle L.","Bailey, Adams G.",The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

In response, healthcare organizations have shifted attentions and resources towards equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) issues and initiatives like never before. Focused, proven equity-centered skill and mindset development is needed for healthcare professionals to operationalize these pledges and stated aims. Aim: This article highlights program evaluation results for this Clinical Scholars National Leadership Institute (CSNLI) specific to EDI. We will show that CSNLI imparts the valuable and essential skills to health professionals that are needed to realize health equity through organizational and system change. Setting: Initial cohort of 29 participants in CSNLI, engaging in the program over 3 years through in-person and distance-based learning offerings and activities. Program Description: The CSNLI is a 3-year, intensive leadership program that centers EDI skill development across personal, interpersonal, organizational, and systems domains through its design, competencies, and curriculum. Program Evaluation: A robust evaluation following the Kirkpatrick Model offers analysis of four data collecting activities related to program participants' EDI learning, behavioral change, and results. Discussion: Over the course of the program, participants made significant gains in competencies related to equity, diversity, and inclusion. Furthermore, participants demonstrated growth in behavior change and leadership activities in the areas of organizational and system change. Results demonstrate the need to center both leader and leadership development on equity, diversity, and inclusion curriculum to make real change in the US Healthcare System.","Corbie, Giselle","Brandert, Kathleen","Center for Health Equity Research, Department of Social Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"

The CDP includes 2 components: 1) a guideline document that provides strategies on how to modify curricula and classroom teaching to incorporate antiracism and principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI); and 2) a structured worksheet for instructors to share EDI and antiracism practices they already incorporate and practices they plan to incorporate into their classes. Worksheets for each class are submitted prior to the beginning of the quarter and are reviewed by a peer faculty member and at least 1 epidemiology student; reviewers provide written feedback on the CDP worksheet. Further evaluation to assess the impact of the CDP process on classroom climate is ongoing. In this commentary, we discuss our department's efforts, the challenges we faced, and our hopes for next steps.","Seiler, Jessie","Hajat, Anjum",
PLoS Biology,2021,6,Promoting inclusive metrics of success and impact to dismantle a discriminatory reward system in science.,"Success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates sexist and racist ""rewards"" by prioritizing citations and impact factors. These metrics are flawed and biased against already marginalized groups and fail to accurately capture the breadth of individuals' meaningful scientific impacts. We advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We outline pathways for a paradigm shift in scientific values based on multidimensional mentorship and promoting mentee well-being. These actions will require collective efforts supported by academic leaders and administrators to drive essential systemic change. This Essay argues that success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates sexist and racist 'rewards' by prioritizing citations and impact factors; the authors advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.","Davies, Sarah W.","Putnam, Hollie M.","Department of Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America"

Journal of Business & Psychology,2023,2,Corporate Diversity Statements and Employees' Online DEI Ratings: An Unsupervised Machine-Learning Text-Mining Analysis.,"Following the deaths of many Black Americans in spring 2020, public consciousness rose around the societal mega-threat of racism. In response, many organizations released public statements to condemn racism and affirm their stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). However, little is known about the specific thematic contents covered in such diversity statements and their implications on important organizational outcomes. Taking both inductive and deductive approaches, we conducted two studies to advance our understanding in this area. Study 1 employed structural topic modeling (STM)—an advanced unsupervised machine-learning text-mining technique—and comprehensively analyzed the latent semantic topics underlying the diversity statements publicly released by Fortune 1000 companies in late May and early June 2020. The results uncovered six underlying latent semantic topics: (1) general DEI terms, (2) supporting Black community, (3) acknowledging Black community, (4) committing to diversifying the workforce, (5) miscellaneous words, and (6) titles and companies. Furthermore, drawing from the identity-blindness and identity-consciousness theoretical frameworks and leveraging millions of data points of employees' DEI ratings retrieved from Glassdoor.com, Study 2 further tested and supported hypotheses that companies were more positively rated by their employees on organizational diversity and inclusion if they (1) released (vs. did not release) diversity statements and (2) emphasized identity-conscious (vs. identity-blind) topics in their diversity statements. Our findings shed light on important theoretical implications for the current research and offer practical recommendations for organizational scientists and practitioners in diversity management.","Wang, Wei","Dinh, Julie V.","The Department of Psychology, The CUNY Graduate Center, City University of New York, 365 Fifth Ave, 10016, New York, NY, USA"

Colombia is a country with great scientific potential, but also multiple long-lasting socioeconomical difficulties. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of the temporal trajectories of gender parity in scientific publishing in Colombia. Data was dissected based on education level, researcher's rank and research area, in order to elucidate differential patterns of scientific publishing. We controlled for gender-based differences in number of researchers by quantifying per capita scientific productivity. Our results show widespread gender disparity in scientific publishing persistent across time. Gender-based differences in per capita scientific publishing indicate that gender disparity persists even after controlling for differences in the number of researchers. Temporal trajectories revealed a decrease in women publishing in the medical sciences and a widening of the per capita publishing gender gap. Women senior researchers and women researchers with doctoral degrees had the lowest publishing participation within their group, suggesting access to postgraduate education or entering the workforce in themselves do not prevent women from being underrepresented. We highlight the need to understand the problem of underrepresentation in science and possible ways to address it beyond increasing the number of women researchers.","López-Aguirre, Camilo","Farías, Diana","Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, Canada"

Texas Journal on Civil Liberties & Civil Rights,2022,4,The Unlikely Pressure for Accountability: The Insurance Industry' s Role in Social Change.,"The summer of 2020 witnessed a national reckoning: the murder of George Floyd and the resulting unprecedented Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests. As the BLM movement gained unsurpassed traction, corporate America jumped to show support: Nearly 70% of the 500 largest companies made statements in support of racial justice and more than a third provided financial donations to racial justice organizations/causes. Countless companies made public promises regarding their commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) within their organizations. However companies have largely failed to live up to those promises. The result-frenzy of diversity driven derivative suits against boards and officers for that failure. Although Director and Officer (D&0) insurance has insulated board and officer's personal assets, the D&0 insurance industry has taken notice of the enduring nature of diversity driven derivative suits. Along with social unrest comes the D&0 insurer's unrest; as premiums increase, limits are lowered, and coverage is dropped, the possibility of a new catalyst for accountability arises-the D&0 insurance industry.","Aneiros, Angela N.",,"Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, Gonzaga University School of Law."

Strengthening primary care will be needed to correct the longstanding history of mistreatment of First Nations/Indigenous and racialized people, exclusion of health care workers of color, and health care access and outcome inequities further magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released a report on Implementing High-Quality Primary Care: Rebuilding the Foundation of Health Care, that provided a framework for defining high-quality primary care and proposed 5 recommendations for implementing that definition. Using the report's framework, we identified health equity challenges and opportunities with examples from primary care systems in the United States and Canada. We are poised to reinvigorate primary care because the recent pandemic and the attention to continued racialized police violence sparked renewed conversations and collaborations around equity, diversity, inclusion, and health equity that have been long overdue.

JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine,2023,5,Values-Based Resident Selection in an Internal Medicine-Pediatrics Residency Program.,"Background: There is no consensus regarding values important for medical resident success, and current methods for selecting residents correlate poorly with success in residency. Objective: We developed and validated a set of values demonstrated by exemplary residents in the Internal Medicine-Pediatrics program at the University of Utah and used them to inform our resident selection process. Design: We utilized a modified Delphi method to identify and internally validate values of successful residents. We implemented these values into the interview evaluation rubric. Participants: Four members of the Internal Medicine-Pediatrics residency program leadership and eleven current residents aided in value generation. Nine faculty from leadership positions in the residency programs of Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics formed a local expert panel for validation. Approach: We performed a literature review and engaged local stakeholders in a semi-structured group interview to generate 107 values. After consolidation based on redundancy, two iterative cycles of expert review using a modified Delphi approach, and alignment with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, eleven values achieved expert agreement and were integrated into an interview rubric to aid in resident selection. Key Results: We identified eleven values important for resident success: academic strength, intellectual curiosity, compassion, communication, work ethic, teamwork, leadership, self-awareness, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), professionalism, and adaptability. The rank list from 2021 was found to correlate with a score based on values, but not Step 2 score, as it did in 2017. Conclusions: We applied a modified Delphi method to generate eleven observable values present in the ideal Internal Medicine-Pediatric resident at one academic health center in the Intermountain West. Higher Step 2 scores no longer correlated with higher ranking when we used these values to inform our rank list.","Drum, Benjamin","Lamb, Sara","Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, USA"
Clinical Neuropsychologist,2023,5,Fellow and training director perspectives on personal leaves during fellowship training in neuropsychology and considerations for best practice.,"Objective: Management of personal leaves represents an important component of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. This study aims to understand the ways in which both training directors and fellows in neuropsychology training programs understand, perceive, communicate about, and plan for personal leaves during fellowship training. We also aim to provide empirically based recommendations for training directors communicating with fellows about personal leaves. Method: Training directors (N = 40) and postdoctoral fellows (N = 51) were recruited to complete surveys examining their knowledge and perspectives on personal leaves through a professional listserv. Results: While most training directors reported that their programs offer paid personal leave options, a substantial minority did not. There were discrepancies between training directors' and fellows' knowledge about leave policies and perceptions of the professional implications of taking a personal leave, such that fellows reported less knowledge and a greater perception that taking a leave during training may have a negative professional impact. Conclusions: Findings suggest that training directors in neuropsychology should clearly communicate institutional leave policies early in, or even before the start of, the fellowship period and work to cultivate a culture of openness around both broad issues of work-life balance and specific issues related to personal leaves with trainees.","Shapiro, Danielle N.","Anderson, Carolyn","Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Michigan Medicine/University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"
Training & Education in Professional Psychology,2023,5,Addressing Intersectional Identities and Experiences in Professional Psychology Trainees With Disabilities: A Call for Action.,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion are frequently espoused as critical priority areas in psychology, including education and training. Professional psychology trainees and psychologists with disabilities experience a unique set of barriers (e.g., inaccessible work environments, lack of relevant mentorship experiences, and cultural competency surrounding disability) that contribute to negative consequences for training, recruitment, and retention. Furthermore, disabled trainees and psychologists with intersecting and marginalized identities possess a nuanced perspective on these challenges that are largely missing from both the data and scholarly literature in the field. To address this disparity, it is imperative that the field of professional psychology takes action to collect more nuanced population-level data but also actively implement change strategies to advance the field. Strategies for identifying unique barriers and perspectives of disabled trainees with intersecting identities include conducting subanalyses of larger data sets that are appropriate for smaller sample sizes, conducting contextual (e.g., qualitative) research centering the voices of multiple marginalized and disabled trainees, creating and reinforcing an antiableist culture at training programs and work environments, amplifying the voices and expertise of trainees and psychologists with disabilities and intersecting identities, and supporting disabled trainees and psychologists who may experience activism fatigue. Such actions are critical for bolstering the representation of disabled trainees and psychologists with intersecting identifies, and ultimately improving our delivery of services to patients who experience similar challenges, barriers, and discrimination in their own lives.","Lund, Emily M.","Khazem, Lauren R.","Department of Educational Studies in Psychology, Research Methodology and Counseling, University of Alabama"

AEM Education & Training,2023,4,What to know about 2.0: Revisions to the pediatric emergency medicine milestones.,"Introduction: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) adopted educational milestones for trainee assessment in 2013, as a key component of the Next Accreditation System. Two years later, the ACGME, American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), and American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) collaborated to create specialty‐specific subcompetencies in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM). Since that time, emerging data have demonstrated the need to revise specialty milestones. Consequently, the ACGME summoned a working group to revise the original PEM milestones. Methods: The PEM Milestones 2.0 Working Group convened in April 2021, comprising diverse representation from ACGME staff, PEM and EM attendings, PEM fellowship program directors, PEM fellows, and community members, overseen by the ACGME's vice president for milestones development. The group met virtually six times over 3 months, with concurrent independent and subgroup work, to draft the PEM Milestones 2.0 and supplemental guide. Results: The working group's revisions generated concise descriptions of behavioral anchors to define skill acquisition more accurately; attention to the transition from residency to fellowship training; incorporation of harmonized milestones for non–patient care and non–medical knowledge domains; and increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion. A supplemental guide was also designed to aid programs in designing programmatic assessment related to specialty‐specific milestones. Conclusions: The PEM Milestones 2.0 provide an updated, specialty‐specific framework to guide the development and assessment of PEM fellows and training programs. Future work may focus on faculty and learner development, advancing validity evidence, strengthening content expertise, and integrating milestones with specialty‐specific entrustable professional activities.","Sagalowsky, Selin T.","Rudinsky, Sherri L.","Department of Emergency Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York New York,, USA"

Utilizing Transdisciplinary Scholarship on Structural Inequality to Educate Psychology Graduate Students.,"Introduction: The scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) should promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice for the next generation of psychologists. Statement of the Problem: I worry that the SoTL propagates an exclusionary field that becomes increasingly irrelevant in our diverse society given that graduate curricula largely exclude scholarship on structural inequality. Literature Review: I detail the process of graduate curricular changes in my current department, with a focus on my new required graduate course, Diversity, Systems, and Inequality. I utilize scholarship from law, sociology, philosophy, women and gender studies, education, and psychology. Teaching Implications: I provide the structure and content of the course—including syllabi and lecture slides—as well as modes of assessment that promote inclusivity and critical thinking.

After the 2020 uprisings which proclaimed ""Black Lives Matter"", popular media have been replete stories depicting white settler's guilt about what the world owes Black and marginalized peoples, as well as intense political backlash against racial justice (e.g., [3]). This white nationalist backlash vehemently and misguidedly opposed ""Critical Race Theory"" which became a mischaracterized nomenclature of (all) anti-racist discourse and a bogeyman concocted by a heterogeneous group of white and conservative-leaning political operators aiming to uphold white supremacy and to oppose demographic and justice-led political change, actions and philosophies.","Perry, Keston K.",,"Williams College, Williamstown, MA, USA"

Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research®,2023,4,The Majority of Black Orthopaedic Surgeons Report Experiencing Racial Microaggressions During Their Residency Training.,"<bold>Background: </bold>Orthopaedic surgery is the least-diverse surgical specialty based on race and ethnicity. To our knowledge, the impact of this lack of diversity on discriminatory or noninclusive experiences perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during their residency training has never been evaluated. Racial microaggressions were first defined in the 1970s as ""subtle verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group."" Although the term ""microaggression"" has long been established, more recently, as more workplaces aim to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion, it has entered the medical profession's lexicon as a means of describing the spectrum of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in the healthcare environment.<bold>Question/purposes: </bold>(1) What is the extent of discrimination that is perceived by Black orthopaedic surgeons during residency? (2) What subtypes of racial microaggressions (which encompasses racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion) do Black orthopaedic surgeons experience during residency training, and who are the most common initiators of these microaggressions? (3) What feedback statements could be perceived as racially biased to Black orthopaedic surgeons in residency training? (4) Are there gender differences in the reported types of racial microaggressions recalled by Black respondents during residency training?<bold>Methods: </bold>An anonymous survey was administered between July 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020, to practicing orthopaedic surgeons, residents, and fellows in the J. Robert Gladden Orthopaedic Society database who self-identify as Black. There were 455 Black orthopaedic surgeons in practice and 140 Black orthopaedic residents or fellows in the database who met these criteria. Fifty-two percent (310 of 595) of participants responded. Fifty-three percent (243 of 455) were practicing surgeons and 48% (67 of 140) were current residents or fellows. Respondents reported their perception of discrimination in the residency workplace using a modified version of the single-item Perceived Occupational Discrimination Scale and were asked to recall any specific examples of experiences with racial discrimination, bias, or exclusion during their training. Examples were later categorized as different subtypes of racial microaggressions and were quantified through a descriptive analysis and compared by gender.<bold>Results: </bold>Among survey respondents, 34% (106 of 310) perceived a lot of residency workplace discrimination, 44% (137 of 310) perceived some residency workplace discrimination, 18% (55 of 310) perceived a little residency workplace discrimination, and 4% (12 of 310) perceived no residency workplace discrimination. Categorized examples of racial microaggressions experienced in residency were commonly reported, including being confused for a nonphysician medical staff (nurse or physician's assistant) by 87% (271 of 310) of respondents or nonmedical staff (janitorial or dietary services) by 81% (250 of 310) of respondents. Racially explicit statements received during residency training were reported by 61% (190 of 310) of respondents. Thirty-eight percent (117 of 310) of such statements were reportedly made by patients and 18% (55 of 310) were reportedly made by attending faculty. Fifty percent (155 of 310) of respondents reported receiving at least one of nine potentially exclusionary or devaluing feedback statements during their residency training. Among those respondents, 87% (135 of 155) perceived at least one of the statements to be racially biased in its context. The three feedback statements that, when received, were most frequently perceived as racially biased in their context was that the respondent ""matched at their program to fulfill a diversity quota"" (94% [34 of 36]), the respondent was unfriendly compared with their peers (92% [24 of 26]), or that the respondent was ""intimidating or makes those around him/her uncomfortable"" (88% [51 of 58]). When compared by gender, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken for janitors and dietary services at 97% (63 of 65), compared with Black men at 77% (187 of 244; p < 0.01). In addition, Black women more frequently reported being mistaken as nurses or physician assistants (100% [65 of 65]) than Black men did (84% [205 of 244]) during orthopaedic residency training (p < 0.01). Black women also more frequently reported receiving potentially devaluing or exclusionary feedback statements during residency training.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Perception of workplace discrimination during orthopaedic residency training is high (96%) among Black orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. Most respondents reported experiencing discrimination, bias, and exclusion that could be categorized as specific subtypes of racial microaggressions. Several different examples of racial microaggressions were more commonly reported by Black women. Certain feedback statements were frequently perceived as racially biased by recipients.<bold>Clinical Relevance: </bold>To better understand barriers to the successful recruitment and retention of Black physicians in orthopaedics, the extent of racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion in residency training must be quantified. This study demonstrates that racial discrimination, bias, and exclusion during residency, wholly categorized as racial microaggressions, are frequently recalled by Black orthopaedic surgeons. A better understanding of the context of these experiences of Black trainees is a necessary starting point for the development of a more inclusive workplace training environment in orthopaedic surgery.","Brooks, Jaysson T.","Porter, Scott E.","Scottish Rite for Children, University of Texas-Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"
Journal of Graduate Medical Education,2023,4,"Trends of Academic Faculty Identifying as Hispanic at US Medical Schools, 1990-2021.","According to recent census data, Hispanic and Latino populations comprise the largest minority group in the United States. Despite ongoing efforts for improved diversity, equity, and inclusion, Hispanics remain underrepresented in medicine (UIM). In addition to well-established benefits to patient care and health systems, physician diversity and increased representation in academic faculty positively impact the recruitment of trainees from UIM backgrounds. Disproportionate representation (as compared to increases of certain underrepresented groups in the US population) has direct implications for recruitment of UIM trainees to residency programs. To examine the number of full-time US medical school faculty physicians who self-identify as Hispanic in light of the increasing Hispanic population in the United States. We analyzed data from the Association of American Medical Colleges from 1990 to 2021, looking at those academic faculty who were classified as Hispanic, Latino, of Spanish Origin, or of Multiple Race—Hispanic. We used descriptive statistics and visualizations to illustrate the level of representation of Hispanic faculty by sex, rank, and clinical specialty over time. Overall, the proportion of faculty studied who identified as Hispanic increased from 3.1% (1990) to 6.01% (2021). Moreover, while the proportion of female Hispanic academic faculty increased, there remains a lag between females versus males. Our analysis shows that the number of full-time US medical school faculty who self-identify as Hispanic has not increased, though the population of Hispanics in the United States has increased.","Saxena, Monica Rakesh","Ling, Albee Y.",
Journal of Graduate Medical Education,2023,4,Educational Outcomes of Diversity Curricula in Graduate Medical Education.,"Education is an important step toward achieving equity in health care. However, there is little published literature examining the educational outcomes of curricula for resident physicians focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Our objective was to review the literature to assess the outcomes of curricula for resident physicians of all specialties focused on DEI in medical education and health care. We applied a structured approach to conducting a scoping review of the medical education literature. Studies were included for final analysis if they described a specific curricular intervention and educational outcomes. Outcomes were characterized using the Kirkpatrick Model. Nineteen studies were included for final analysis. Publication dates ranged from 2000 to 2021. Internal medicine residents were the most studied. The number of learners ranged from 10 to 181. The majority of studies were from a single program. Educational methods ranged from online modules to single workshops to multiyear longitudinal curricula. Eight studies reported Level 1 outcomes, 7 studies reported Level 2 outcomes, 3 studies reported Level 3 outcomes, and only 1 study measured changes in patient perceptions due to the curricular intervention. We found a small number of studies of curricular interventions for resident physicians that directly address DEI in medical education and health care. These interventions employed a wide array of educational methods, demonstrated feasibility, and were positively received by learners.","Chung, Arlene S.","Cardell, Annemarie",
Journal of Aging & Social Policy,2023,3,Anti-Ageism for Gerontologists.,"We argue that gerontologists are products of our ageist culture and that we both perpetuate ageism and suffer from internalized ageism ourselves. We make ageist comments, deny our own age, fail to teach students to recognize and confront ageism, and use language that otherizes and categorizes older people. Gerontologists are in ideal positions to confront ageism through our scholarly work, teaching, and community engagement. However, we suggest that, despite our deep gerontological knowledge, we do not have enough awareness, knowledge, and skills for taking anti-ageism actions in these arenas of our professional lives. We offer some suggestions for confronting ageism, including self-study, increasing content on ageism in the classroom and beyond, pointing out ageist language and behaviors to colleagues and students, working with diversity, equity and inclusion offices on campus, and giving careful consideration to our research approaches and academic writing. To go forward, we must increase awareness about ageism and gain skills in promoting anti-ageism.","Morrow-Howell, Nancy","Kunkel, Suzanne",Washington University

Pedagogy in Health Promotion,2023,3,Understanding the Connection Between Student Wellbeing and Teaching and Learning at a Canadian Research University: A Qualitative Student Perspective.,"Postsecondary students' ability to learn is affected by their mental health and wellbeing. Research in the teaching and learning context, however, has predominantly focused on teaching practices that facilitate motivation, learning, and academic success while overlooking the importance of student mental health and wellbeing. The current study aimed to fill this gap by using qualitative interviews to explore student perspectives on current and possible future supports that can cultivate student mental health and wellbeing in the teaching and learning context. Through 14 one-on-one interviews with students, five major themes were developed: (1) prioritize mental health, (2) provide and guide to accessible supports, (3) increase mental health literacy, (4) foster connections and social support, and (5) strengthen best practices in teaching and learning. Students emphasized that the institution has a role to play in several of these areas and elaborated on what practices and policies were least and most supportive of student mental health and wellbeing in teaching and learning. This study has implications for higher education institutions, and how they promote mental health and wellbeing, disseminate information and resources, and how faculty and staff can support students through their policies (e.g., flexibility in deadlines), course materials (e.g., assessments), course delivery (e.g., equity, diversity, and inclusion [EDI] considerations), and interactions (e.g., normalizing mental health conversations).","Lindsay, Brittany L.","Bernier, Emily","University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"

Journal of Social & Personal Relationships,2023,3,Editorial Synthesis for 2 in 2023: A Collaboration Between IARR's Two Journals: Recognizing the Need for Greater Inclusivity in Relationship Science.,"The idea for this special issue came from the current Editors of the Journal for Social and Personal Relationships and Personal Relationships, who wanted to forge a collaboration between the International Association for Relationship Research's two journals. This collaboration came at a time when issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion were being brought to light in science, broadly defined. Stemming from such discussions, for this special issue, the Editors asked 10 sets of authors to apply an intersectional lens – grounded in Crenshaw's (1989, 1991) definition of intersectionality and drawing from questions posed by Cole (2009) – to their systematic review of literature from the past 20 years (1992–2022) and to answer these three questions: (1) from whose vantage point is the research being conducted, (2) what types of questions are valued, and (3) who is included in the research versus who is being left out/whose voices are missing. Manuscripts in the special issue include these topics: (a) affectionate communication, health, and relationships, (b) romantic relationship maintenance behaviors, (c) relationship maintenance among military couples, (d) relational sacrifices, (e) LGBTQ-inclusive research, (f) stress, support, and coping for romantic couples, (g) daily stress and romantic relationship quality, (h) infidelity, (i) relationship dissolution, and (j) the longitudinal study of romantic close relationships. Across the reviews, authors noted many of the same patterns; most studies included samples from the U.S., wherein participants identified as White, heterosexual, and female; however, military samples were dominated by men. The methods employed were largely quantitative, cross-sectional, and/or with data coming from surveys. Observations during the review process included the role of positionality as well as greater knowledge gained about the critical framework of intersectionality, specifically acknowledging that elements of diversity in sampling methods are not an application of intersectionality; rather, intersectionality places central focus on (a) how multiply marginalized social identities have been historically oppressed and (b) how systems of power, oppression, and privilege construct, reproduce, and sustain those multiply marginalized social identities.

Canadian Ethnic Studies,2021,9,"""I feel more Canadian with hockey."" Identity and Belonging via Ice Hockey in a Diverse Canada.","This paper explores the relationship between the participation in organized ice hockey by immigrants and racialized minorities (compared to those born in Canada and who are white) and their sense of national identity and sense of belonging to Canada. A Bourdieusian theoretical framework is utilized to conceptualize hockey in terms of a field, habitus, and cultural and symbolic capital. The argument is made that hockey is Janus-faced and a contested terrain with a tension between exclusion and inclusion whereby human agency is vitally important. Yet the hockey arena and engagement in the game, either as players or fans or in some other capacity, provides a multicultural common space potentially enabling an interactive pluralism amongst diverse communities. The data are derived from qualitative semi-structured interviews with hockey players, fans and key informants in Calgary and Toronto. Overall, the findings show that for most immigrants and racialized minorities engaged in organized ice hockey, there is more likely a sense of Canadian national identity and a sense of belonging to Canada compared to the Canadian-born and to whites. These findings further add to the value of making hockey more inclusive via equity, diversity and inclusion policies and initiatives. Cet article explore la relation entre la participation au hockey sur glace organisé par des immigrants et minorités raciales (comparé avec ceux qui sont nés au Canada et qui sont blancs) ainsi que leur sens d'identité nationale et leur sens d'appartenance au Canada. Utilisant les théories de Bourdieu pour conceptualiser le hockey en termes d'un champ social, habitus, et capital culturel et symbol-ique. L'argument est fait que le hockey est un terrain contesté et il est en conflit avec un aspect d'exclusion et d'inclusion où l'action humaine est d'une importance vitale. Pourtant, l'arène de hockey et l'engagement dans le jeu, soit comme joueur ou admirateur, fournissent un espace commun multiculturel qui peut également promouvoir un pluralisme interactif parmi les diverses communautés. Les données sont dérivées des entrevues qualitatives semi-structurées avec des joueurs de hockey, des admirateurs de hockey et des informateurs clés à Calgary et Toronto. En tout, les résultats démontrent que pour la plupart des immigrants et minorités raciales qui sont engagés dans le hockey organisé, leur sens d'identité nationale et sens d'appartenance au Canada est plus fort par rapport à ceux qui sont nés au Canada et ceux qui sont blancs. Les résultats démontrent davantage la valeur rattachée au besoin de faire le hockey plus inclusif à travers des politiques et initiatives touchant à l'équité, la diversité, et l'inclusion.","Wong, Lloyd L.","Dennie, Martine",

Journal of Higher Education Policy & Management,2023,2,Strategic and policy responses to intersectionality in higher education.,"This paper analyses the extent to which intersectionality is considered in university strategic approaches to equity, diversity, and inclusion, and how intersectionality is expressed within strategic plans. Intersectionality is a framework for understanding compounding experiences of those who identify with multiple diversity areas and how these factors interact to create an experience specific to this combination. Through a survey of publicly available diversity and inclusion action plans at Australian universities, this paper maps the extent of both intersectionality awareness and enactment. This paper shows that while there were mentions of intersectionality, these were often limited to aspirational statements and acknowledgements rather than meaningful enactment. This demonstrates a desire by universities to respond to intersectionality in education, but either a lack of action or understanding of how to act for positive impact. This paper provides considerations and recommendations for Australian universities to meaningfully include intersectionality in their strategies and action plans.","Harpur, Paul","Szucs, Brooke","TC Beirne School of Law, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"
Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research®,2023,2,"How Does Orthopaedic Surgeon Gender Representation Vary by Career Stage, Regional Distribution, and Practice Size? A Large-Database Medicare Study.","Background: Orthopaedic surgery has the lowest proportion of women surgeons in practice of any specialty in the United States. Preliminary studies suggest that patients who are treated by physicians of the same race, ethnicity, cultural background, or gender feel more comfortable with their care and may have better outcomes. Therefore, understanding the discrepancies in the diversity of the orthopaedic surgeon workforce is crucial to addressing system-wide healthcare inequities. Questions/purposes: (1) Does a difference exist in gender representation among practicing orthopaedic surgeons across geographic distributions and years in practice? (2) Does a difference exist in gender representation among practicing orthopaedic surgeons with regard to rural-urban setting, group practice size, and years in practice? Methods: Orthopaedic surgeons serving Medicare patients in 2017 were identified in the Medicare Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File and Physician Compare national databases. This dataset encompasses more than 64% of practicing orthopaedic surgeons, providing a low proportion of missing data compared with other survey techniques. Group practice size, location, and Rural-urban Commuting Area scores were compared across physician gender and years in practice. Linear and logistic regressions modeled gender and outcomes relationships adjusted by years in practice. Least-square means estimates for outcomes were calculated by gender at the median years in practice (19 years) via regression models. Results: According to the combined Medicare databases used, 5% (1019 of 19,221) of orthopaedic surgeons serving Medicare patients were women; this proportion increased with decreasing years in practice (R2 0.97; p < 0.001). Compared by region, the West region demonstrated the highest proportion of women orthopaedic surgeons overall (7% [259 of 3811]). The Midwest and South regions were below the national mean for proportions of women orthopaedic surgeons, both overall (5% [305 of 6666] and 5% [209 of 4146], respectively) and in the first 5 years of practice (9% [54 of 574] and 9% [74 of 817], respectively). Women worked in larger group practices than men (median [interquartile range] 118 physicians [20 to 636] versus median 56 [12 to 338]; p < 0.001, respectively). Both genders were more likely to practice in an urban setting, and when controlling for years in practice, there was no difference between men and women orthopaedic surgeons practicing in rural or urban settings (respectively, R2 = 0.0004 and 0.07; p = 0.89 and 0.09). Conclusion: Among orthopaedic surgeons, there is only one woman for every 20 men caring for Medicare patients in the United States. Although gender representation is increasing longitudinally for women, it trails behind other surgical subspecialties substantially. Longitudinal mentoring programs, among other evidenced initiatives, should focus on the more pronounced underrepresentation identified in Midwestern/Southern regions and smaller group practices. Gender-based equity, inclusion, and diversity efforts should focus on recruitment strategies, and further research is needed to study how inclusion and diversity efforts among orthopaedic surgeons improves patient-centered care.

Urology,2022,2,Women Are Underrepresented in Prestigious Recognition Awards in the American Urological Association.,"<bold>Objective: </bold>To determine the proportion of women who received awards from the American Urological Association (AUA) and evaluate whether this has changed over time as the proportion of practicing female urologists has increased.<bold>Methods: </bold>A retrospective review of award recipients from the AUA website was performed. Gender of award recipient, type of award and year received were collected and the trend over time was compared with the AUA census.<bold>Results: </bold>Of the 622 award recipients, 43 (6.9%) were women. There was a larger proportion of women who received early career awards (15/65; 23.1%) compared to women who received more prestigious mid (1/44; 2.3%) or senior (27/513; 5.3%) career awards. Additionally, 17/43 (39.5%) of female award recipients were not clinical urologists, compared to only 33/579 (5.7%) of male award recipients.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Despite increased representation by women in the field of urology, women remain underrepresented in awards given by the AUA. Although the proportion of women receiving awards over time has increased, it remains less than expected given the increased proportion of practicing female urologists.

Perspectives on Medical Education,2022,12,"""Walking on eggshells"": experiences of underrepresented women in medical training.","Introduction: Medicine remains an inequitable profession for women. Challenges are compounded for underrepresented women in medicine (UWiM), yet the complex features of underrepresentation and how they influence women's career paths remain underexplored. This qualitative study examined the experiences of trainees self-identifying as UWiM, including how navigating underrepresentation influenced their envisioned career paths. Methods: Ten UWiM family medicine trainees from one Canadian institution participated in semi-structured group interviews. Thematic analysis of the data was informed by feminist epistemology and unfolded during an iterative process of data familiarization, coding, and theme generation. Results: Participants identified as UWiM based on visible and invisible identity markers. All participants experienced discrimination and ""otherness"", but experiences differed based on how identities intersected. Participants spent considerable energy anticipating discrimination, navigating otherness, and assuming protective behaviours against real and perceived threats. Both altruism and a desire for personal safety and inclusion influenced their envisioned careers serving marginalized populations and mentoring underrepresented trainees. Discussion: Equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in medical education risk being of little value without a comprehensive and intersectional understanding of the visible and invisible identities of underrepresented trainees. UWiM trainees' accounts suggest that they experience significant identity dissonance that may result in unintended consequences if left unaddressed. Our study generated the critical awareness required for medical educators and institutions to examine their biases and meet their obligation of creating a safer and more equitable environment for UWiM trainees.","Rezaiefar, Parisa","Abou-Hamde, Yara","Bruyère Academic Family Health Unit, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"

Computer Supported Cooperative Work: The Journal of Collaborative Computing,2022,12,Humor and Stereotypes in Computing: An Equity-focused Approach to Institutional Accountability.,"We propose equity-focused institutional accountability as a set of principles to organize equity, inclusion, and diversity efforts in computer science organizations. Structural inequity and lack of representation of marginalized identities in computing are increasingly in focus in CSCW research – and research institutions as well as tech organizations are struggling to find ways to advance inclusion and create more equitable environments. We study humor in a computer science organization to explore and decode how negative stereotypes create unnecessary and avoidable barriers to inclusion and counter efforts to creating a welcoming environment for all. We examine the humor embedded in sociomaterial artefacts, rituals, and traditions, and uncover the stereotyped narratives which are reproduced in formal and informal spaces. We argue that these stereotyped narratives both pose a risk of activating stereotype threat in members of marginalized groups, and of normalizing and reproducing ideas of who belongs in computer science. We situate and discuss the complexity of institutional accountability in the context of a traditionally participatory and collegial model of governance. As a way forward we propose three principles for an equity-focused approach to accountability in computer science organizations: 1) Examine organizational traditions and spaces to critically evaluate challenges for inclusion; 2) Normalize critical reflection in the core practices of the organization; 3) Diversify and improve data collection.","Borsotti, Valeria","Bjørn, Pernille","Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark"
Libri: International Journal of Libraries & Information Services,2022,12,Depictions of Diversity in Books Recommended for Storytime: A Cautionary Tale.,"Elements of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in diverse books support children's intellectual, social, and emotional development. Public library storytime programs serve as venues to showcase books with characters of varied backgrounds, identities, and experiences who may or may not reflect those of the communities the libraries serve. Because storytime providers often rely on online resources to plan their programs, it is important to investigate the presence and quality of EDI elements in books recommended for storytimes by these resources. The present study analyzed the text, illustrations, and WorldCat metadata for a random sample of 481 children's books recommended by six popular online resources for storytime planning. Results revealed an overall lack of EDI in the recommended books with few characters representing parallel cultures, living with a disability or chronic illness, practicing a religion other than Christianity, or communicating in a language other than English. The paper includes implications for storytime providers and library administrators in the areas of program planning, professional development, and program assessment.","Ingram, Erin","Cahill, Maria","St Bernard Branch, Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, 10 McClelland Ave, 45217 Cincinnati, OH, USA"
Pedagogy in Health Promotion,2019,12,What Do Schools of Public Health Have to Say About Diversity and Inclusion?,"Objective. The purpose of this study was to understand how schools of public health (SPHs) define and operationalize diversity and inclusion. Methods. Data were collected in February 2017 from publicly available websites for each of the 59 Council on Education in Public Health–accredited SPHs, including mission/vision, goals/strategic plans, and diversity statements. Mentions of diversity were quantified to generate the proportion of SPHs that explicitly address diversity or inclusion. As a related secondary point, mentions of equity were also considered. Results. One third of SPHs do not mention diversity, inclusion, or equity as central tenets of the school. Twenty percent do not mention strategic plans or goals related to diversity, inclusion, or equity. Only 12 of the 59 schools define what they mean by diversity. Conclusions. Recently released Council on Education in Public Health accreditation competencies point to a need for increased attention by SPHs to inclusion and equity. Currently, however, most SPHs do not have a clear definition of how they define diversity. Implications. Additional research is needed into how SPHs will evolve their conceptualizations of diversity, inclusion, and equity to meet the training needs of the next generation of public health professionals.","Merino, Yesenia",,"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"

Infant Mental Health Journal,2022,7,Mind the Gap(s): Reflective supervision/consultation as a mechanism for addressing implicit bias and reducing our knowledge gaps.,"Mental health‐related professions, like many fields, have begun reexamining common practices and opportunities following the 2020 reawakening to the need for antiracist practices/policies. This push includes encouraging both seasoned professionals and newer trainees to do inward and outward work to increase self‐ and other‐awareness and recognize biases. Often, it is unclear where to begin, and this deeper reflection can bring up uncomfortable realizations about oneself, colleagues, and even broader professions. Doing this deep work is most beneficial when done in a community that can provide support and further challenge. Thus, the practice of reflective supervision/consultation (RSC) is well‐suited for integration of conversations about bias (implicit and explicit) as well as racism/antiracism. The current paper provides background on these concepts, the model of RSC, and specific examples of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles within the infant and early childhood mental health (IECMH) field. Parallels are drawn to existing ""key concepts"" of reflective supervision to provide examples for integrating conversations about bias into reflective supervision. Finally, specific tools and strategies for use are offered as starting points, with encouragement for supervisors to continue to generate ideas and tools for these important conversations. Next steps and implications for broader practice are also discussed.",,,

Educational Review,2022,2,Toward a conceptual model of hierarchical microaggression in higher education settings: a literature review.,"This study developed a conceptual model of hierarchical microaggression phenomena in colleges and universities in the United States. Young, Anderson, and Steward coined the term ""hierarchical microaggression"" in 2015, which refers to microaggression towards defenceless and less powerful stakeholders. Because the hierarchical microaggression concept shares similarities with various forms of microaggression and bullying in hierarchical structures' power dynamics, this study reviewed literature pertaining to microaggression and bullying incidents in higher education settings. Among 187 articles located, approximately 61% (115 articles) demonstrated these phenomena. Through the lens of Bolman and Deal's four organizational frames – structural, human resource, political, and symbolic – a synthesis of the literature identified factors that shape the phenomena's conceptual model. The model showed that individuals who hold inferior or lower-ranked positions in colleges or universities often are victims of hierarchical microaggression; further, regardless of demographic characteristics, anyone can be either a victim or a perpetrator, while stakeholders from socially marginalised backgrounds tend to be victimised, regardless of their position. Hierarchical microaggression incidents tend to be justified in the name of supervising or mentoring (human resource frame), institutional policies (structural frame), and an institution's tradition or culture (symbolic frame) as a result of limited resources or perpetrators' positional power (political frame). This study articulates the unspoken realities behind such incidents, and suggests best practices and future research to prevent such incivility and cultivate diversity, equity, and inclusion on college campuses.","Lee, Ahlam",,"Department of Leadership Studies and Human Resource Development, College of Professional Sciences, Xavier University, Cincinnati, OH, USA"

Objective: This mixed-methods study evaluates a statewide collaboration formed to develop a strategic plan for a comprehensive mixed-delivery system serving children birth to age 5 using instruments appropriate to an early-stage collaboration and adding a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Method: All collaboration members were asked to complete the Collaborative Vitality Survey and a random subsample of members with high rates of participation completed phone interviews. Survey data were summarized across six dimensions: participation, community, productivity, communication, accountability, and synergy. Using thematic analysis and frequencies, qualitative interviews were coded along these dimensions and DEI, incorporating an appreciative inquiry approach identifying barriers, supports, and hopes for the future. Results: Overall, collaborative participation was high. Across methods, respondents reported they, overall, were pleased with collaborative functioning. Qualitative interviews suggest the collaboration domains of community and participation were most salient. Concrete recommendations from participants can be put into practice and inform the collaboration as state-level work continues. Conclusion: The early stage of collaboration is fundamental to success and defined by building cohesion, norms, and roles. This study highlights key weaknesses and strengths that influence collaborative functioning at this stage and illustrates the significance of defining and manifesting DEI in collaboration efficacy. This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating collaboration in an ongoing manner to ensure effectiveness and inform improvements in functioning over time.","Tabbutt, Kelly","Maher, Erin J.","Department of Sociology, University of Oklahoma, 73019, Norman, OK, USA"

Conservation Letters,2021,7,Women and Global South strikingly underrepresented among top‐publishing ecologists.,"The global scientific community has become increasingly diverse over recent decades, but is this ongoing development also reflected among top‐publishing authors and potential scientific leaders? We surveyed 13 leading journals in ecology, evolution, and conservation to investigate the diversity of the 100 top‐publishing authors in each journal between 1945 and 2019. Out of 1051 individual top‐publishing authors, only 11% are women. The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and Canada account for more than 75% of top‐publishing authors, while countries of the Global South (as well as Russia, Japan, and South Korea) were strikingly underrepresented. The number of top‐publishing authors who are women and/or are from the Global South is increasing only slowly over time. We outline transformative actions that scientific communities can take to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion at author, leadership, and society level. The resulting promotion of scientific innovation and productivity is essential for the development of global solutions in conservation science.","Maas, Bea","Pakeman, Robin J","Department of Botany and Biodiversity Research, Division of Conservation Biology, Vegetation Ecology and Landscape Ecology, University of Vienna, Rennweg 14, Vienna 1030,, Austria"

An empirical evaluation of business faculty members’ perceptions of DEI efforts.,"Abstract A core value of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation standards is diversity and inclusion. Using survey data collected from faculty members within the College of Business at a 4-year U.S. university, this study assesses faculty perceptions regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The findings show that most participants believe that the college is committed to DEI values and agree that the college stakeholders recognize the benefit/need for equity. However, most faculty think that a culture of equity does not categorize their institution and are not aware of the recruitment and retention strategies used by the college or the university.","Beer, Francisca","Samuel, Gilna","Jack H.

Educational Administration Quarterly,2022,4,Diversity Ideology and School Leadership: Obscuring Inequities for Emergent Bilingual Students in Career and Technical Education.,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the ways in which school leaders in career and technical education (CTE) conceptualized diversity and inclusion for emergent bilingual students (EBs) and how their beliefs about diversity manifested in institutional support (or lack thereof) for EBs. Research Method: This study draws on data collected during a year-and-a-half long qualitative case study at a large, nationally recognized CTE center. The primary sources of data were interviews with administrators, teachers, and students; local artifacts, student records, and state-level enrollment data were also used. Findings: CTE administrators adhered to diversity ideology when discussing issues of diversity and EBs' inclusion at their institution and believed that they cultivated an inclusive educational environment. This ideology resulted in superficial diversity and inclusion initiatives that did not ensure that EBs had equitable access to CTE program nor that teachers had a sufficient system of support to ensure EBs' academic success, despite the administration's stated commitment to equal opportunity and inclusion. Implications: These findings suggest the need for administrators to critically examine their conceptualization of diversity and equity when considering how to support EBs in CTE programs.","Emerick, Mark R.",,"1143 Muhlenberg College, Allentown, PA, USA"

BMC Proceedings,2021,11,Proceedings of the inaugural Canadian Healthcare Navigation Conference: a forum for sharing innovations and best practices in navigation services.,"Background: Individuals experiencing chronic illnesses face many physical, emotional, and social strains as a result of their illnesses, all the while trying to navigate unfamiliar territory in the healthcare system. Navigation is a strategy that can help people facing complex care needs and barriers to care in finding and accessing needed supports in the health care system. Navigators provide a patient-centred service, guiding individuals through their care plans and overcoming barriers to care. Navigation supports for individuals experiencing complex care needs have shown significant promise and have been gaining traction across Canada. Methods: The Canadian Healthcare Navigation Conference was the first event of its kind in Canada to bring together navigation researchers, service providers, students, decision makers, and individuals with lived experience to share lessons learned, promising practices, and research findings. This event was co-hosted by the Family Navigation Project at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and NaviCare/SoinsNavi at the University of New Brunswick, and took place virtually on April 15–16, 2021. Results: This event spanned two days, which both began with a keynote address, one from a researcher and medical professional in navigation, and another from an individual with lived experience involved in advocacy in Canadian healthcare. Concurrent oral presentations by a variety of presenters were held following each keynote presentation. A poster session was held at the end of the first day, and a panel presentation rounded out the second day. Concurrent and poster presentations covered a range of topics pertaining to approaches to navigation, navigator roles, evaluation and quality improvement, lived experience in navigation, and navigation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The panel presentation focused on identifying how the navigation field has progressed in Canada and identifying crucial next steps in navigation. These next steps were determined to be: 1) agreement on navigation-related definitions, 2) regulation and training, 3) equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, 4) integrating lived experience, and 5) regional coordination. Conclusion: This conference was an important first step to creating a shared national conversation about navigation services so that we can continue to develop, implement, and share best evidence and practices in the field.","Markoulakis, R.","Luke, A.","Family Navigation Project, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada"

Boston College Law Review,2021,11,DEPRESSION TO DEDICATION: HOW CHIEF JUSTICE GANTS SAVED MY LIFE AND CATALYZED ONGOING ADVOCACY FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION.,"Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants was more than just a lauded member of the Massachusetts state judiciary. He was a mentor, a confidant, a friend. Gavin Alexander, one of Chief Justice Gants's former Law Clerks, writes in deeply personal terms about the incredible kindness, empathy, and pure humanity that defined the late Chief Justice. Alexander, through the narrative of his journey coping with depression and eventually becoming a public advocate for mental health and diversity, equity, and inclusion in the legal profession, emphasizes the marked impact Chief Justice Gants had on his life and the lives of so many other lawyers experiencing similar struggles. Beyond his individual story, Alexander describes how, under Chief Justice Gants's leadership, the Supreme Judicial Court created its initial Steering Committee on Lawyer Well-Being in 2018 and its more permanent Standing Committee on Lawyer Well-Being in January 2020. As the Committee's first Fellow, Alexander describes how the Committee strives to improve lawyer well-being in Massachusetts by breaking down the stigma against discussing mental health issues and seeking help, by educating the Massachusetts legal profession about topics and resources relating to well-being, and by advocating for systemic change to make the Massachusetts legal profession more rewarding, sustainable, and inclusive. This critical work, which continues today, carries on Chief Justice Gants's legacy, and challenges Massachusetts lawyers to embody and advocate for the kindness, empathy, and desire for equitable justice that Chief Justice Gants exhibited his entire life.","ALEXANDER, GAVIN",,Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Standing Committee on Lawyer Well-Being

This article analyzes one attempt: ""Perspectives on Public Values,"" a course that fosters empathy in difficult conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) while relying on literary fiction as its material. To draw lessons for programs offering similar courses, it assesses the student experience, focusing on: concerns students had before the course; whether those concerns manifested in the course; what most surprised students; what the instructor should do differently/the same in the future; and the students' main lessons. Data come from students' written reflections and the instructor's reflection. This study finds: more students voiced concerns about the DEI aspect of the course than about its basis in literary fiction; in the future the instructor should make stronger connections to public administration; and students' reported increased self-awareness, and derived lessons about the importance of multiple perspectives and lived experiences, and implications for public service practice. It concludes with recommendations for pedagogy, workplace training, and how public administrators might view DEI issues.","Brainard, Lori A.",,George Washington University

Obstetrics & Gynecology,2022,5,"Race.Culture.OBGYN: Creating a Database of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Resources for Obstetrics and Gynecology Residency Programs [A60].","INTRODUCTION: Multiple studies repeatedly demonstrate that people of color suffer poorer obstetrical and gynecological outcomes in the United States. To improve physician awareness on these inequities, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a Committee Opinion on Race and Ethnic Disparities recommending that all obstetrics and gynecology residency programs address inherent bias and systemic racism. However, competing resident educational requirements leaves limited time for a diverse diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) education beyond the occasional lecture. The Race.Culture.OBGYN initiative seeks to increase the frequency and quality of GME level DEI education by making it applicable to already existing didactics and clinical duties. METHODS: The Race.Culture.OBGYN initiative has curated a wide variety of resources for specific clinical conditions in every subspecialty in obstetrics and gynecology. The resources are curated on an open access website to allow graduate medical education (GME) programs to incorporate DEI knowledge into specific didactic lectures with ease. Our hypothesis is that residents will feel more comfortable applying DEI education to daily clinical encounters. A national survey of the current statuses of DEI education at residency programs and an evaluation of the resources on the website will be collected. RESULTS: The Race.Culture.OBGYN project has curated resources and has now expanded into creating a podcast series to elevate voices of resident physicians doing DEI work locally. Survey results are pending. CONCLUSION: By creating a single hub of condition-based resources, this project reminds us the issues are more pervasive, present in all aspects of clinical care. Through this, the initiative hopes to transform DEI education for obstetrics and gynecology residents.","Venkatesh, Anusha","Udutha, Anirudh","Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal, Karnataka, India"
Developmental Science,2023,2,"Stereotypes in the classroom's air: Classroom racial stereotype endorsement, classroom engagement, and STEM achievement among Black and White American adolescents.","Research Highlights Initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in predominantly White contexts, including STEM fields, have primarily relied on approaches to increase the representation of minoritized individuals. However, an increase in the representation of minoritized individuals is only one step of the process, as the present study suggests that explicit beliefs about particular racial groups’ abilities also matter. The present article examined whether classroom racial stereotype endorsement about science and math disadvantaged Black American adolescents relative to their White American peers. Across two longitudinal studies with 533 and 1,189 adolescents (<italic>N</italic>‐adolescents = 1722; <italic>N</italic>‐classrooms = 86; 45% Black American, 55% White American; 51% females; <italic>M</italic>‐age = 13–14), classroom pro‐White/anti‐Black stereotype endorsement in the fall term predicted better science and math achievement scores for White American adolescents and lower science and math achievement scores for Black American adolescents at the end of the academic year. Student‐ and teacher‐reported student engagement in science and math classrooms mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro‐White/anti‐Black stereotype endorsement and students’ achievement scores. Results suggest that classrooms may be important conduits for communicating racial stereotypes that create racially hostile STEM learning environments. Using a longitudinal sample of 1722 adolescents enrolled in 86 classrooms, the present study examined the consequences of classroom racial stereotype endorsement during adolescence. White American adolescents demonstrated favorable achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed traditional, or pro‐White/anti‐Black, stereotypes. Black American adolescents showed worse achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed pro‐White/anti‐Black stereotypes. Classroom engagement mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro‐White/anti‐Black stereotype endorsement and achievement scores for both Black and White American adolescents.","Del Toro, Juan","Wang, Ming‐Te",University of Minnesota Twin Cities

Medical Teacher,2023,2,Synthesis and perspectives from the Ottawa 2022 conference on the assessment of competence.,"Abstract Introduction Methods Results and discussion The Ottawa Conference on the Assessment of Competence in Medicine and the Healthcare Professions was first convened in 1985 in Ottawa. Since then, what has become known as the Ottawa conference has been held in various locations around the world every 2 years. It has become an important conference for the community of assessment – including researchers, educators, administrators and leaders – to share contemporary knowledge and develop international standards for assessment in medical and health professions education.The Ottawa 2022 conference was held in Lyon, France, in conjunction with the AMEE 2022 conference. A diverse group of international assessment experts were invited to present a symposium at the AMEE conference to summarise key concepts from the Ottawa conference. This paper was developed from that symposium.This paper summarises key themes and issues that emerged from the Ottawa 2022 conference. It highlights the importance of the consensus statements and discusses challenges for assessment such as issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion, shifts in emphasis to systems of assessment, implications of ‘big data’ and analytics, and challenges to ensure published research and practice are based on contemporary theories and concepts.","Boursicot, Katharine","Kemp, Sandra",Health Professional Assessment Consultancy

Journal of Business & Psychology,2023,2,Black Physicians' Experiences with Anti-Black Racism in Healthcare Systems Explored Through An Attraction-Selection-Attrition Lens.,"Anti-Black racism is a specific form of racism directed at Black people. In healthcare, there are poignant examples of anti-Black racism in the recruitment, selection, and retention stages of the job cycle. Research shows that anti-Black racism is associated with inequitable work outcomes and the under-representation of Black physicians. However, empirical findings are scattered with no organizing framework to consolidate these findings. To add to the literature, in this paper we present the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model (Schneider, 1987) as an organizing framework to discuss Black physicians' experiences with anti-Black racism and discrimination throughout their careers. We draw from previous literature to highlight specific experiences of Black physicians at each stage of the job cycle (i.e., attraction, selection, retention), and we offer considerations on how practitioners can mitigate anti-Black racism throughout the job cycle. In the wake of COVID-19 and highly publicized social justice movements, healthcare systems are seeking ways to increase the recruitment, selection, and retention of Black physicians to ensure health equity. We believe this guide will be valuable to practitioners, leaders, researchers, and program directions seeking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion of Black physicians in their healthcare systems. We conclude by providing practical implications and directions for future research.","Williams, Myia S.","Myers, Alyson K.","Department of Medicine, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA"

Journal of Higher Education,2023,1,Do Rubrics Live up to Their Promise? Examining How Rubrics Mitigate Bias in Faculty Hiring.,"Many colleges and universities now require faculty search committees to use rubrics when evaluating faculty job candidates, as proponents believe these “decision-support tools” can reduce the impact of bias in candidate evaluation. That is, rubrics are intended to ensure that candidates are evaluated more fairly, which is then thought to contribute to the enhanced hiring of candidates from minoritized groups. However, there is scant — and even contradictory — evidence to support this claim. This study used a multiple case study methodology to explore how five faculty search committees used rubrics in candidate evaluation, and the extent to which using a rubric seemed to perpetuate or mitigate bias in committee decision-making. Results showed that the use of rubrics can improve searches by clarifying criteria, encouraging criteria use in evaluation, calibrating the application of criteria to evidence, and in some cases, bringing diversity, equity, and inclusion work (DEI) into consideration. However, search committees also created and implemented rubrics in ways that seem to perpetuate bias, undermine effectiveness, and potentially contribute to the hiring of fewer minoritized candidates. We conclude by providing stakeholders with practical recommendations on using rubrics and actualizing DEI in faculty hiring.","Culpepper, Dawn","White-Lewis, Damani","ADVANCE Program for Inclusive Excellence, University of Maryland College Park, College Park MD, USA"

First, the commitment to ""know more"" must examine the full ecology of relationship violence and sexual misconduct (RVSM); that knowledge is essential for creating multilevel prevention strategies. Second, a full realization of an intersectional perspective requires attention to a broader range of power-based harms, forging institutional links between RVSM prevention and work on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Third, while support for survivors is certainly vital, most people who experience harm do not report it, and so an ambitious approach to prevention is vital to building communities in which everyone can thrive.","Hirsch, Jennifer S.","Khan, Shamus","5798Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"

Journal of Applied Sport Psychology,2023,1,Black Student-Athletes and racism pandemic: Building antiracist practices in athletics.,"The year 2020 was filled with injustices, fear, and uncertainty that has disproportionately affected Black communities in the United States and abroad. From the unprecedented number of deaths inflicted by COVID-19, specifically on minority groups, to the horrific murders of Black citizens by those in positions of authority and power, the world was once again reminded that racism is still alive. Black student-athletes are among those enduring trauma that has been consistent over centuries and are contending with the chronic nature of systemic racism as it pertains to being a Black athlete within the world of athletics and their respective schools. Through grounded theory, researchers captured the lived experiences of 14 Black student-athletes through qualitative interviews to ensure that sports psychology practitioners and researchers are equipped with the correct resources, knowledge, and skills, to aid in the healing of Black student-athletes although also advocating for expedited social reform and representation within the realm of education, law enforcement, politics, and mental health services. Five key domains emerged from this study including Identity Development, Perception and Expectations, Mental Health, Privilege, and Systems. The authors offer best practices within each domain in an effort to develop anti-racist practices to be implemented within athletic institutions and beyond. Lay summary: Black student-athletes are faced with systemic racism within all the worlds they live in, and as it pertains to being an athlete of color within the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Black student-athletes are also coping with major life stressors and, as such, this paper gathered the lived experiences of student-athletes identifying as Black and explored how they experienced support during their tenure as student-athletes in an attempt to establish anti-racist and supportive practices within athletic communities. Develop strategies for athletes to understand and evaluate their identity. Integrate anti-racist practices into large systems including implicit bias training, undoing racism, and privilege education. Create tools and visuals for athletes of color, illustrating the institution's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.","Economou, Peter","Glascock, Tori","Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, Rutgers University"
Family Court Review,2023,1,A compass but not a road map: Diversity considerations with the AFCC Guidelines on Parenting Plan Evaluations.,"The 2022 Guidelines for Parenting Plan Evaluations in Family Law Cases were developed taking into account membership feedback which identified guidance around issues of Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) as a high priority. The current Guidelines have integrated issues of diversity in many areas of the document, by adding a section on guiding principles and values, expanding and clarifying evaluator education and training, and embedding cultural and diversity considerations in many sections of the document. The Guidelines do not provide more direct instruction or education on specific topics or aspects of culture and diversity. Key points for the family court community: The AFCC community recognizes the importance of understanding and including issues of diversity and culture in Parenting Plan Evaluations.The Guidelines have adopted an integrated approach to emphasizing DE&I considerations in key areas of the Parenting Plan Evaluation process.The Guidelines do not offer a ""how to"" approach, which places the responsibility on the forensic evaluator to seek out opportunities, experiences, and knowledge that will further their cultural competence.","Harris‐Britt, April",,"AHB Forensics and Consulting, PLLC"

Public Library Quarterly,2022,12,#StopAsianHate: A Content Analysis of Public Library Statements Released in Response to Anti-Asian Hate.,"With the recent rise in anti-Asian hate incidents, many Asian American communities have been living in a state of uncertainty and fear. In contrast to the harmful rhetoric that has arguably contributed to such acts of hate, some organizations have issued statements in support of Asian American communities. This study seeks to examine the role and potential impact of statements from public libraries in responding to anti-Asian hate. Content analysis was used to identify the themes found in public library statements, the percentage of libraries that actually released statements, and when the statements were released. Some notable themes from the statements include solidarity with Asian American communities, condemnation of hate incidents, providing information resources, the history of anti-Asian racism, and a commitment to EDI (equity, diversity, and inclusion) and social justice. The study describes how the overall lack of public library statements and the timing of the statements may affect the stakeholder relationship between Asian Americans and public libraries. In addition, ALA’s ninth principle in its Code of Ethics is used as a framing tool to point out how public libraries can focus on advocacy, awareness, education, and collaboration when creating statements in response to future hate incidents.","Chae, Andrew",,San José State University

I also show there is a more complex version of staging of difference, which I call diversity theater. Applying this framework allows us to understand the different shapes diversity regimes may take depending on industry and organizational structure, which can help us better understand the underlying structures that halt racial equity.","Glass, Leah E.",,"Department of Sociology, CUNY Graduate Center, New York, NY, USA"
Stat,2022,12,Becoming a JEDI statistician.,"JEDI stands for justice, equity, diversity and inclusion. JEDI is a global movement, with networks connecting academic, business and grass roots organizations. A definition of ‘JEDI statistics’ and ‘impermissible inequality’ is proposed and illustrated with stories from government work, university teaching and academic research regarding race, ethics and social justice in statistics. I recently had the pleasure of discussing these ideas on a panel with Wendy Martinez, Safiya Umoja Noble, Donna LaLonde and participants in a plenary session of SDSS 2021, ‘Equitable and Inclusive Data and Technology’. I thank them for their comments, and Wendy Martinez, notably (https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2021/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm? AbstractID=309823).

AEM Education & Training,2022,12,The next generation of researchers: One-year outcome data from the SAEM Advanced Research Methodology Evaluation and Design in Medical Education (ARMED MedEd) program.,"Introduction: As the field of medical education evolves, there is a need to increase the quality of education scholarship and develop a cadre of research scholars; however, clinician educators (CEs) considering this career transition have limited formal training in education research methodology to heed this call. Therefore, a program that provides more advanced training in education scholarship for CEs without the financial and resource barriers of fellowships and masters programs is needed. Methods: The SAEM Advanced Research Methodology Evaluation and Design in Medical Education (ARMED MedEd) program is a longitudinal program for the beyond-beginner CE, seeking advanced training in education research. The program was created using a comprehensive needs assessment and included longitudinal training; small-group projects; dedicated project mentors; and integrated diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Program participants applied for a grant upon program completion. Results: Twenty-one participants completed the course with 100% completing the baseline survey and 67% (14/21) completing the end-of-program survey. Participants reported improved perception of knowledge across all of the topics with a medium to large effect size, ranging from 0.40 to 0.62. When asked about impact on their network of potential collaborators, participants reported a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 5-8) out of 9. When asked about the impact on their community of practice, participants reported a median of 7 (IQR 5-7) out of 9. When asked about the impact on their professional identity, participants reported a median of 7 (IQR 4-9) out of 9. Participants also reported an increase in both the quantity (mean of 2 ± 1 new mentors) and the quality (median score 7 [IQR 5-8] out of 9) of new research mentorship as a result of the program. Open-ended feedback was generally positive, with 100% reporting they would advise others to take this program. Conclusions: The SAEM ARMED MedEd program represents a proof of concept for an advanced education research program seeking to fill the research training gap for the beyond-beginner Clinician educators.","Gottlieb, Michael","Chan, Teresa M.","Department of Emergency Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA"
Journal of the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics,2022,12,An Update to Scientific Decision Making: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Scientific Integrity Principles.,"In 2015, the Council on Research published their vision for scientific decision making, which provided nutrition and dietetics practitioners and practitioners-in-training key information on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' newly developed scientific integrity principles. Given that it has been 7 years since the original publication, it was believed the original six principles should be revisited and updated. From the Subcommittee on Scientific Integrity Principles under the Council on Research, the 2015 principles were evaluated and updated with new literature and best practices for maintaining scientific integrity principles. After this review process, four new/updated principles were approved by the Council on Research. These include: 1) the ethical conduct of research and protection of human subjects, 2) funder's influence on the research question/methodology/education content and conflicts of interest, 3) review of research-related materials, and 4) maintain and promote a culture of scientific integrity. Moreover, it became clear that newer topics, including diversity, equity, and inclusion should be woven throughout the principles. This article presents the newly updated principles and resources related to scientific integrity principles. We envision that this document can be used by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to educate members and serve as a guide to incorporate these principles into all research practices and at all levels of dietetics practice.","Lennon, Shannon L.","Kazaks, Alexandra","Department of Nutrition and Exercise Science, School of Natural Health Arts & Sciences, Bastyr University, Seattle, Washington"

Educational Administration Quarterly,2022,12,Searching for Amistad in Two School Districts: A Case Study of Black History Curriculum Implementation in New Jersey.,"Background: Over the past 30 years, much debate has been produced about improving the quality and caliber of curriculum taught to public school students. Less prominent in these discussions has been the content of Black history and culturally relevant curriculum. Many states and districts assume they are adequately including these experiences through theme months (i.e., Black History Month) or single school days dedicated to workshops on diversity and equity. Unlike most states, the State of New Jersey has legislated the inclusion of Black history education through the enactment of the Amistad Legislation. In doing so it stands out among its peers, but has this legislation actually enacted curricular change? Research Design: We engage a decoloniality framework in this exploratory case study of two districts, describing how each is interpreting Amistad, the processes they subsequently implement, the curricular results, and if/how these attempts address dominant Eurocentric frames essential to the project of coloniality. Findings: We find that simply following the legislation itself does not result in a great deal of reform. The districts we profile, rather than follow the vague dictum of Amistad, opt to follow the ""spirit"" of the law. The result is clear curricular reform and district-level changes. Our cases present interesting points of discussion as they are at two distinct points on the spectrum of implementation—one having already established a well-regarded curriculum, the other in the early stages of reform. Despite this, administrators in each express the value of Amistad for their students, faculty, and communities.","Clay, Kevin L.","Broege, Nora C.

Along with this critically important goal, it is imperative that we acknowledge gender is more expansive than a binary category because it represents a spectrum of gender identities. The discussion of this spectrum is lacking in our conversations around gender diversity and equity in radiology. Addressing equity for people of all gender identities is beneficial for us all. We define three key areas of focus: (1) improving fundamental knowledge about gender diversity and application of this knowledge in education, (2) recruiting and retaining gender-diverse physicians and (3) specific diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy to support gender-affirming environments. Improved understanding and inclusion of the full spectrum of gender in these areas will improve diversity and equity, and, in turn, enhance creativity and innovation in radiology.","Zavaletta, Vaz","Allen, Brittany J.","Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA"

The conference consisted of keynote speeches, presentations, and panel discussions on a variety of scholarly communication topics. Main themes were the value of the Version of Record and how to preserve quality and trust in the scholarly record. Collaboration across all stakeholders and high-quality metadata are key, especially when looking at the future where a “record of versions” could exist, connecting all research outputs. Other conference topics involved the threat of paper mills, research integrity and the importance of digital preservation. To ensure trustworthy and high-quality publications, knowledge exchange and cooperation are crucial. Effective partnerships and a multi-perspective approach are key in fostering inclusion, diversity and equity in scholarly communication too. Several speakers stressed the important role publishers play in moving towards an inclusive and trusted Open Science ecosystem, in which data sharing is accelerated and quality assurance and control are implemented across the entire research cycle. To achieve this, new ways of working and new business models need to be developed, and entrepreneurship and innovation encouraged. The 17th APE ended with a session in which five startups showcased their innovative products to advance science.","Duine, Maaike",,"Freelance Author, Berlin, Germany"

Grounded in applied communication scholarship and co-cultural theory (Orbe, 1996), this project investigated how CDOs frame their campus work, and employ communicative practices in formal and informal settings to design institutional policies and build campus support for their efforts. To explore how CDOs accomplish their institutional work, in-depth interviews (N = 25) were conducted with higher education CDOs. CDOs employed communicative practices that confirmed the practices identified by Orbe (1998a), and engaged in a nuanced practice of reflexive questioning. Communicative practices were all strategically employed by CDOs to advance conversations about race, diversity, equity, and inclusion in order to move campus constituents to action in support of institutional changes to language, policies, and practices.","Ruiz-Mesa, Kristina",,

However, bioethicists should question the categories used to define diversity. The act of categorization is value laden, and classification systems confer power and benefits and generate harms. For example, what conditions count as disabilities? We should consider the equity implications of offering only ""male"" and ""female"" options for self‐identification in health records. However, we should also interrogate all ideas about categorization, including how categories are formed, why they are formed, and who decides. Bioethicists cannot comprehend fully what equity and justice mean for underrepresented, underserved, or marginalized people until there is an understanding of how the boundaries of marginalization are created.","Cho, Mildred K.",,
International Journal of Inclusive Education,2021,3,Beyond 'safety': teachers and school staff approaches to LGBTI-inclusion in Tasmanian schools.,"Australian and international research consistently indicates that inclusive school cultures improve the educational outcomes and health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) students. Little is known, however, about how Tasmanian school staff are supporting LGBTI students or the needs of teachers and school staff in creating and sustaining inclusive school environments. To address this knowledge gap, this paper reports on findings from a qualitative inquiry conducted with teachers and school staff. Drawing on Szalacha's (2004. ""Educating Teachers on LGBTQ Issues."" Journal of Gay & Lesbian Issues in Education 1 (4): 67–79. doi:10.1300/J367v01n04_07.) three paradigms of LGBTI-inclusive education practices, this study found that teachers and school staff employ Safety and Equity approaches in an education system where there is little time or resources given to knowing and understanding relevant policy focused on supporting LGBTI students. We argue that the school staff's perception of school and departmental policy influences how they understand what is expected and what is possible in supporting LGBTI students. Findings from this study point to the need for inclusive education policies that inform and support teachers and foster potential for more critical approaches to equity and diversity.","Grant, Ruby","Beasy, Kim","School of Social Sciences, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia"
Medical Education,2015,1,Seeking inclusion in an exclusive process: discourses of medical school student selection.,"Context Calls to increase medical class representativeness to better reflect the diversity of society represent a growing international trend. There is an inherent tension between these calls and competitive student selection processes driven by academic achievement. How is this tension manifested? Methods Our three-phase interdisciplinary research programme focused on the discourses of excellence, equity and diversity in the medical school selection process, as conveyed by key stakeholders: (i) institutions and regulatory bodies (the websites of 17 medical schools and 15 policy documents from national regulatory bodies); (ii) admissions committee members ( ACMs) (according to semi-structured interviews [ n = 9]), and (iii) successful applicants (according to semi-structured interviews [ n = 14]). The work is theoretically situated within the works of Foucault, Bourdieu and Bakhtin. The conceptual framework is supplemented by critical hermeneutics and the performance theories of Goffman. Results Academic excellence discourses consistently predominate over discourses calling for greater representativeness in medical classes. Policy addressing demographic representativeness in medicine may unwittingly contribute to the reproduction of historical patterns of exclusion of under-represented groups. In ACM selection practices, another discursive tension is exposed as the inherent privilege in the process is marked, challenging the ideal of medicine as a meritocracy. Applicants' representations of self in the 'performance' of interviewing demonstrate implicit recognition of the power inherent in the act of selection and are manifested in the use of explicit strategies to 'fit in'. Conclusions How can this critical discourse analysis inform improved inclusiveness in student selection? Policymakers addressing diversity and equity issues in medical school admissions should explicitly recognise the power dynamics at play between the profession and marginalised groups. For greater inclusion and to avoid one authoritative definition of excellence, we suggest a transformative model of faculty development aimed at promoting multiple kinds of excellence. Through this multi-pronged approach, we call for the profession to courageously confront the cherished notion of the medical meritocracy in order to avoid unwanted aspects of elitism.","Razack, Saleem","Hodges, Brian","Centre for Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal Quebec, Canada"

Teaching & Learning in Medicine,2022,4,A Novel Narrative Medicine Approach to DEI Training for Medical School Faculty.,"Abstract <bold> <italic>Problem</italic> </bold>:Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) trainings for medical school faculty often lack self-reflective and pedagogically focused components that may promote incorporation of anti-racism and social justice into medical school curricula. <bold> <italic>Intervention</italic> </bold>: A four-session Narrative Medicine (NM) anti-racism program was designed for medical school faculty using critical race theory, phenomenology, and NM methods. Each workshop consisted of a lecture on key NM concepts and a small-group breakout session incorporating group discussion, close reading, and reflective writing. <bold> <italic>Context</italic> </bold>: This NM anti-racism program was developed and implemented in April 2021 by two medical students for faculty at an institution in the southeastern U.S. The program was supported by the Office of Inclusive Excellence at the institution and held in collaboration with the institution’s medical education teaching academy. Program evaluation consisted of pre- and post-program surveys, which queried participants’ previous experiences with DEI and medical humanities programs, perceptions of self-identity and privilege, and confidence in teaching concepts of anti-racism. Of the total program participants (n = 32), 19 completed both surveys (54.3%). Survey data were analyzed using bivariate testing methods and qualitative thematic analysis. <bold> <italic>Impact</italic> </bold>: Post-program surveys showed 13 (68.4%) participants felt “somewhat more” or “more” comfortable engaging in concepts of race, and 12 (63.2%) participants felt “somewhat more” or “more” comfortable including topics of race into their teaching compared to before the program. Five themes were generated following qualitative analysis: (1) the value of longitudinal narrative reflection in a small-group setting for DEI work; (2) desire to commit more time to DEI, anti-racist, and social justice work while balancing busy teaching and clinical schedules; (3) the value of storytelling in DEI and anti-racism programming; (4) an understanding of deconstructive and reconstructive work of anti-racism in medicine; and (5) an increased ability to educate and enact change through teaching, activism, and institutional cultural and policy changes. <bold> <italic>Lessons Learned</italic> </bold>: This novel NM DEI training for medical school faculty was successful in increasing comfort discussing and teaching concepts of race in the medical school classroom, while providing a uniquely reflective space for personal growth. Participation in this longitudinal reflective experience was limited by physician schedules, therefore efforts to make time to participate in similar longitudinal interventions must be undertaken.","Holdren, Sarah","Iwai, Yoshiko",The University of North Carolina School of Medicine

Journal of Evidence-Based Social Work (2640-8066),2022,9,Campus Climate Assessments: Limitations of Siloing Sexual Violence and Diversity Surveys.,"Climate surveys are common tools for assessing and improving the experience at institutions of higher education. However, methodological limitations currently exist as assessment tools tend to be siloed with climate surveys assessing sexual misconduct on campus generally failing to assess issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and vice versa. As a result of this siloing, institutions of higher education possess a limited ability to notice and address patterns of injustice and inequity that cut across campus climate domains. This review summarizes the limitations of siloing sexual misconduct and diversity and inclusion climate assessments and provides a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of utilizing a comprehensive approach to assessing campus climate. From this framework we derive theoretical and practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners to advance scholarship and guide institutional research, planning, and practice.","Leskinen, Emily A.","Cusano, Julia","Social Science and Human Services, Ramapo College of New Jersey, Mahwah, New Jersey, USA"
Pedagogy in Health Promotion,2022,9,Nutrition Professionals Feel Underprepared to Serve Persons With Marginalized Identities.,"With increasing attention on diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), it is necessary that nutrition professionals are educated and trained to provide inclusive care for all individuals. Yet, little is known about how nutrition students are educated and trained to serve persons with marginalized identities. Using the Diffusions of Innovations Theory, the purpose of this study is to identify early adopters of inclusive approaches to dietetics care and understand their preparedness to serve marginalized persons. This descriptive pilot study used a virtual intercept interview approach using poll style questions in a Facebook group (#InclusiveDietetics) dedicated to sharing content about DEI in dietetics, as members of the group were identified as ""early adopters"" of inclusive care. Five questions assessed the type of education, diversity of educators, and sources of information that nutrition professionals used to learn to serve marginalized clients. Descriptive statistics (counts and frequencies) were used to analyze the data. About 79.31% of participants reported receiving no education or training from their accredited dietetics programs interacting with patients with mental disabilities, physical disabilities, identifying within the LGBQ+ and Trans community, and of different cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds. When they received it, nearly 75% of participants reported receiving training on working with patients of different racial/ethnic backgrounds but only 5.56% reportedly received training to serve persons within the LGBTQ+ community. Nutrition professionals feel prepared to interact with marginalized groups to some extent; however, more research, education, and training are needed to develop best practices and adequately prepare professional to serve marginalized patients.","Burt, Kate G.","Losak, Rachel","Lehman College, City University of New York, Bronx, NY, USA"
Science Education,2022,9,Promoting equity in the peer review process of journal publication.,"While there is evidence to support the existence of identity‐based disparities, inequities, and biases in the academic journal peer‐review process, little research supports the presence of this bias in the peer‐review process for academic journals in science education. Through an analysis of six leading journals in science education, we aimed to investigate the extent to which diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as well as the presence of bias in the peer‐review process, are addressed by these journals. We analyzed trends in the gender/sex, geographical affiliation, race/ethnicity, and the presence of equity‐centered research focus for members of these journals' editors and editorial boards. We found that although gender/sex is well‐balanced in these journals' editors and editorial boards, they are typically North American centric, and White individuals are overwhelmingly represented. Four journals had a quarter or more of individuals who pursue equity‐centered research. Only two journals provided detailed information on how manuscripts are reviewed in their author submission guidelines. All used a double‐blind approach to peer‐review. One of the journals includes an explicit position on DEI. Based on the analyses and reflections on our own experiences, we recommend science education journals consider ways to probe whether bias does exist in their peer‐review process, diversify their board to be more inclusive of scholars from communities historically marginalized, and move to a triple‐blind approach to their peer‐review process as mechanisms to mitigate bias in the journal peer review.","Bancroft, Senetta F.","Ryoo, Kihyun","School of Education and School of Chemical and Biomolecular Sciences, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale Illinois,, USA"

"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics",2022,9,Analysis of the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee (ARRO EISC) Black History Month (BHM) Campaign: Moving Beyond Awareness.,"Social Media (SoMe) is an important tool to translate knowledge for Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI). It promotes collaborative discussions beyond traditional borders. We report on our experience with our second annual Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology (ARRO) Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee (EISC) Black History Month (BHM) campaign. We hypothesize that this social media awareness campaign will result in participation and engagement among radiation oncologists (ROs). A one-month Twitter campaign was conducted by the ARRO EISC from February 4th to March 8th, 2022. We highlighted work of one historical Black RO weekly through a series of Tweets, video presentations, and engagement (replies, quote tweets, retweets, and likes). Main hashtags utilized included #BlackHistoryMonth and #EISC. Tweets were collected each week using NodeXL. Cross-sectional analysis provided engagement and demographic data. There were 59 unique tweets (22, 10, 8, 19, during weeks 1-4 respectively) including 33 original (14, 6, 5, 8) and 26 with quoted comments (8, 4, 3, 11). There were 18 replies (8, 2, 4, 4), 80 retweets (32, 18, 9, 21), and 311 likes (32, 18, 9, 21). There were 6,012 video views (3034, 844, 1099, 1035). For the weekly tweets, there were a total of 48,181 impressions (27224, 6227, 7280, 7450) and 1,201 engagements (448, 176, 184, 393). Among 64 total participants, 20 provided unique content (48, 18, 13, 25), with 45 trainees (including 37 RO Residents/Fellows and 6 medical students), 39 MD staff including 35 ROs and 3 oncology-related disciplines. Additional participants included 10 oncology allied healthcare professionals including 7 physicists, 18 organizations including institutions and specialty societies. The most online engagement was from RO residents (169, 40.4%), RO faculty (143, 34.2%), organizations (52, 12.4%), and others (32, 7.7%). Activity was highest on week 1 and the day of the original posts. There were more RO-related black history month tweets not related to our campaign, including cross-tweeting from our participants and partners. We showed sustained interest through an intentional social media campaign highlighting Black RO during BHM with an increase in number of participants, and high engagement using video presentations. Limitations included missing data from lack of hashtag use, inability to quantify reach outside Twitter, English language, and North America. Future campaigns can focus on greater coordination with Black ROs engaging in similar activities and focused planning leading to Black History Month.","Ewongwo, Agnes","Pereira, Ian","Stanford University, Stanford, California"
International Journal of Inclusive Education,2021,2,"Understanding the politics of inclusion, the 'refugee' and nation: analysis of public policies and teacher narratives in Iceland.","Even though Iceland is yet to host as many refugees as other European countries, the number of young refugees seeking resettlement is growing rapidly. Little Icelandic research has been devoted to refugee youth and their social or educational inclusion to date. This study focuses on how young refugees are represented in the Icelandic context in relation to often-conflicting ideological perspectives of advanced neo-liberal discourses and 'liberal' multicultural approaches of inclusion. We analyse policy documents which address refugee integration, alongside teachers' perspectives on current challenges facing refugee youth to account for these conflicts. We are interested in how these documents and perspectives respond to Hannah Arendt's concern over statelessness – the condition of not being recognised as a citizen within a host state. Findings indicate that outside of policy directly aimed at refugees there is general legislative and regulatory silence on refugee youth. Within the two documents analysed, we argue that normative multicultural frameworks are being drawn upon as an 'integration practice' which emphasise sameness and equality in contrast to diversity and equity. Such practices reinforce normative understandings of citizenship and national metaphors of inclusion whilst simultaneously undermining what Arendt refers to as the 'promise of politics' in education policy and practice.","Harðardóttir, Eva","Magnúsdóttir, Berglind Rós","School of Education, University of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland"

However, challenges facing marginalized communities in the Global South are less frequently investigated, yet of great importance. Millions of people depend on information for essential everyday life activities such as transportation. Successful, timely daily commuting between home and work influences financial stability, family time, and safety. Everyday life information behavior as a research lens can reveal information activities, influencing factors, information sources, and contexts applying to informal transportation use by poorer socio‐economic groups. Theories of information behavior such as information poverty and information horizons can shed light. Understanding information behavior contexts, and how to bridge the digital divide and promotion of networking, sharing, and learning for marginalized populations through community‐led digital literacy training can help tailor interventions.","Fourie, Ina","Agarwal, Naresh K","University of Pretoria,, South Africa"
Journal of Library Administration,2021,2,In Pursuit of Diversity in the CUNY Library Profession: An Effective Approach to Leadership in Academic Libraries.,"Maximizing the current organizational culture and diversity/inclusion practices within CUNY libraries is crucial to retaining highly talented support staff with significant potential for future leadership roles. This research explores equity, diversity, and inclusion within the library profession, with the intention of implementing strategic frameworks to attract, recruit, and retain underrepresented groups within the University. To spotlight areas of upward mobility within CUNY academic libraries, a CUNY-wide Library Workplace Climate survey on the perceptions of diversity, universal inclusion, and career progression was conducted. The scope of the survey study compares the different perspectives of CUNY librarians, full-time library classified paraprofessionals, and part-time classified staff to measure CUNY's commitment to addressing the diversity gap in the library profession. CUNY-wide, 141 library employees participated in a survey study to uncover professional development opportunities in support of career advancement and upward mobility. Nearly 2 in 5 African American/Black library staff-members are paraprofessionals, while 13.5% are faculty. A stark contrast to 3 in 5 or 64% CUNY library faculty, which identified as White/Caucasian. The findings reinforce the need for measures to maximize workplace diversity through support-staff mentoring, guidance, and recruitment. Workplace mentorship and career development—across all levels within CUNY libraries—cultivate skills for a better work environment that can lead to promotion and successful plans for succession. Investing and sustaining structured library professional development opportunities geared toward underrepresented groups—generally in paraprofessional and student-worker roles—will help identify next generation CUNY library leadership.","Sanchez-Rodriguez, Nilda Alexandra",,"Assistant Professor/Chief Architecture Librarian, City College of New York, New York, NY, USA"

Our work explores efforts to rethink music education—for all—from the ground up, which requires disrupting many of the norms through which music education has been conventionally understood. In this article, we bring together lessons learned to offer five recommendations for music pedagogy and sound-based inquiry that support a more inclusive understanding of music—one that situates aural/sound/music learning experiences as actively critical and collaborative practices. We suggest that by developing a contextualized, community-based, learner-oriented model, we might be better equipped to create opportunities for all learners.","Thumlert, Kurt","Harley, Daniel",
British Educational Research Journal,2021,8,Guests in someone else's house? Sense of belonging among ethnic minority students in a Hong Kong university.,"The evolution of globalisation and ensuing internationalisation of higher education need radical reform of institutional policies and practices to promote education for diversity, equity and inclusion. Extant literature on university/college student persistence/retention witnesses a lack of research on the subjective sense of belonging on campus among ethnic minoritised students who have been historically marginalised in higher education and are now part of the emerging demographic on campus. This study attempted to fill the gap. Engaging qualitative individual interviews with 12 university students of South/Southeast Asian ethnicity in Hong Kong, the purpose of this study was to examine their perceptions and experiences of institutional affiliations and engagement in university. Findings suggested that being connected to the programme and university, and the depth and quality of intragroup dynamics, are key to a sense of belonging among ethnic minority students. Findings also elucidated a lack of cross‐cultural interaction and racial/ethnic diversity within the university environment, which shaped participants' feelings of isolation and exclusionary experiences as they sought to adjust to the campus academically and socially. The study's findings could help inform the development and evaluation of institutional strategies that can sustain minoritised students in university transitions and promote institutional connectedness and academic success among all students on campus.","Gao, Fang","Liu, Henry Chi Yin","The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"
Computer Music Journal,2021,7,"Addressing NIME's Prevailing Sociotechnical, Political, and Epistemological Exigencies.","Nearly two decades after its inception as a workshop at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) exists as an established international conference significantly distinct from its precursor. Although this origin story is often noted, the implications of NIME's history as emerging from a field predominantly dealing with human–computer interaction (HCI) have rarely been discussed. In this paper we highlight many of the recent—and some not so recent—challenges that have been brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of the neoliberal university—which have underpinned academia's drive for innovation—and the quantification and economization of research performance that have facilitated certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies, we suggest that critical reflection and, moreover, mediation is necessary to address burgeoning concerns that have been raised within the NIME discourse in relation to methodological approaches, ""equity, diversity, and inclusion,"" ""accessibility,"" and the fostering of ""rigorous"" interdisciplinary research.","Hayes, Lauren","Marquez-Borbon, Adnan","School of Arts, Media and Engineering Arizona State University Stauffer B, 950 South Forest Mall, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA"
Berkeley Technology Law Journal,2021,7,TECHNOLOGY LAW AS A VEHICLE FOR TECHNOLOGY JUSTICE: STOP ISP THROTTLING TO PROMOTE DIGITAL EQUITY.,"Society has shifted to bandwidth intensive internet use to protect public health, sustain economic participation and educational attainment, and support critical infrastructure services. This shift made robust, open, broad-based internet network (ROBIN) access essential to public safety and societal resilience. This Article examines Internet Service Provider (ISP) throttling policies, an underexplored area of the digital divide, net neutrality, and consumer protection legal and policy debate. Many ISPs use contract terms and software to slow users to 2G speeds, more commonly used in the early 1990s, after internet use commensurate with a few days or a week or two of digital work or school. The difference between open internet access and throttled access is the ability to access school, work, or a telemedicine appointment through videoconferencing platforms and other applications. This Article theorizes infrastructure law and policy as a legal superstructure that either reifies vulnerability and inequity or, if constructed differently, supports equity and technology justice. To build the legal architecture necessary to foster ROBIN access critical to education, health, economic, and civic opportunities, this Article calls for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) examination of ISP throttling policies and disclosures. It calls on ISPs, as part of their commitments to diversity, inclusion, and equity, to drop the practice of throttling users to speeds that make contemporary internet uses unavailable. It argues that stemming ISP throttling is critical to equity, opportunity, public health, and public safety.","Sandoval, Catherine J.

The purpose of this study was to examine the print materials used in public library storytime programs to identify the extent to which storytime exposes children to diverse people. Results indicate that, across all categories examined, books shared in storytimes are lacking in terms of diversity.

American Journal of Epidemiology,2020,10,Epidemiologists Count: The Role of Diversity and Inclusion in the Field of Epidemiology.,"We present interpretations of the idea that ""epidemiologists count"" in response to the current status of membership and diversity and inclusion efforts within the Society for Epidemiological Research (SER). We review whom epidemiologists count to describe the (mis)representation of SER membership and how categorizations of people reflect social constructions of identity and biases that exist in broader society. We argue that what epidemiologists count — how diversity and inclusion are operationalized—has real-world implications on institutional norms and how inclusive/non-inclusive environments are. Finally, we examine which epidemiologists count within the field and argue that inclusion can only be achieved when we address how resources and opportunities are distributed among epidemiologists. To improve diversity and inclusion within SER and beyond, we recommend that SER strengthen its commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity by: 1) integrating this priority on all agendas; 2) enhancing efforts to improve self-awareness among members and accountability within the organization; 3) supporting the growth of a diversifying workforce in epidemiology; and 4) increasing the visibility of health disparities research and researchers in epidemiology.","Ðoàn, Lan N","Bacong, Adrian M",

AEM Education & Training,2020,2,Advancing Diversity and Inclusion: An Organized Approach Through a Medical Specialty Academy.,"Background: The benefits of a diverse workforce in medicine have been previously described. While the population of the United States has become increasingly diverse, this has not occurred in the physician workforce. In academic medicine, underrepresented in medicine (URiM) faculty are less likely to be promoted or retained in academic institutions. Studies suggest that mentorship and engagement increase the likelihood of development, retention, and promotion. However, it is not clear what form of mentorship creates these changes. The Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine (ADIEM), an academy within the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, is a group focused on advancing diversity and inclusion as well as promoting the development of its URiM students, residents, and faculty. The Academy serves many of the functions of a mentoring program. We assessed whether active involvement in ADIEM led to increased publications, promotion, or leadership advancement in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Methods: We performed a survey of ADIEM members to determine if career development and productivity, defined as written scholarly products, presentations, and mentorship in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion was enhanced by the establishment of the academy. To determine whether there were significant changes in academic accomplishments after the formation of ADIEM, two groups, ADIEM leaders and ADIEM nonleader members, were examined. Results: Thirteen ADIEM leaders and 14 ADIEM nonleader members completed the survey. Academic productivity in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion increased significantly among ADIEM leaders when compared to ADIEM nonleader members after the founding of ADIEM. In particular, in the ADIEM leader group, there were significant increases in manuscript publications (1.31 ± 1.6 to 5.5 ± 7.96, p = 0.12), didactic presentations (3.85 ± 7.36 to 23.46 ± 44.52, p < 0.01), grand rounds presentations (0.83 ± 1.75 to 8.6 ± 10.71, p < 0.05), and student/resident mentees (6.46 ± 9.36 to 25 ± 30.41, p = 0.02). Conclusion: The formation of a specialized academy within a national medical society has advanced academic accomplishments in diversity, equity, and inclusion in emergency medicine among ADIEM leadership. Involvement of URiM and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender faculty in the academy fostered faculty development, mentoring, and educational scholarship.","Pierce, Ava E.","Moreno‐Walton, Lisa","Department of Emergency Medicine, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX"

American Journal of Epidemiology,2020,10,Recommendations to the Society for Epidemiologic Research for Further Promoting Diversity and Inclusion at the Annual Meeting and Beyond.,"Increasing diverse engagement in the Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER) will positively impact the field of epidemiology. As the largest and longest-running epidemiologic society in North America, SER has long been a pioneer in promoting diversity and inclusion. A recent survey of SER members, however, showed there is still room for improving diversity, inclusion, representation, and participation in the Society. In this commentary, as members of both the SER and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Epidemiology's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Anti-Racism, and Science (Epi IDEAS) Working Group, we recommend 4 goals for the SER Annual Meeting and beyond: 1) convene epidemiologic researchers with diverse backgrounds and ideas; 2) promote an inclusive environment at the SER Annual Meeting; 3) develop, compile, and disseminate best practices to honor diversity in epidemiologic research; and 4) increase prioritization of health disparities research and methods. We also suggest strategies for achieving these goals so that SER can better include, support, and elevate members from historically disadvantaged groups. While our recommendations are tailored specifically to SER, the greater epidemiologic and academic communities could benefit from adopting these goals and strategies within their professional societies and conferences.","Zhang, Mingyu","Jarrett, Brooke A",

Previously, no measure of diversity climate has been validated. Furthermore, addressing challenges concerning the basis of diversity climate perceptions, we reviewed disparate diversity climate definitions and scales to identify its core components and sources, focusing on the treatment of organizational members who identify as marginalized group members. Using full-time employee samples (N = 1639), tests of content validity (study 1), exploratory factor analysis (study 2), confirmatory factor analysis (study 3), convergent and discriminant validity (study 4), and criterion validity (study 5) were conducted. Results suggest that the MGF-DCS comprises three subscales: (1) interpersonal valuing of marginalized groups; (2) organizational representation and inclusion of marginalized groups; and (3) organizational anti-discrimination. Furthermore, the MGF-DCS exhibited measurement invariance across marginalized group identification. In study 5, using the MGF-DCS, we tested how perceptions of diversity climate predict organizational and personal outcomes, as moderated by participants' marginalized group identification. In general, the more participants perceived their workplaces to have a positive diversity climate, the better they saw social dynamics in their workplace (e.g. higher cohesion) and the better their personal outcomes (e.g. lower job stress); in some cases, these benefits were stronger for employees identifying as marginalized group members (e.g. less experienced discrimination). Thus, the MGF-DCS provides a reliable and valid assessment of diversity climate in organizations that can be used to advance theory, research, and diversity management practice.","Sakr, Nouran","Son Hing, Leanne S.","Department of Psychology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"

Denver Law Review,2021,4,DISCRIMINATION AS ANTI-ETHICAL: ACHIEVING SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN LARGE LAW FIRMS.,"As protests calling for racial justice erupted across the country in 2020, many large law firms issued compelling statements acknowledging systemic inequities and bias. During the preceding few decades, firms had already expressed their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion; some had launched well-publicized diversity initiatives. Still, breakthrough progress has been elusive. Women, and especially women of color, continue to be severely underrepresented in partnership ranks. The gender pay gap at law firms persists. An unrelenting pattern of heavy burden in the lived experiences of women and women of color at law firms continues. This Article argues that an ethical reset is needed to drive true systemic change in large law firms. With the gender pay gap in law firm partnership compensation as a vehicle, this Article explains precisely how the design of the rules of professional conduct renders them largely symbolic on discrimination and ineffective against longstanding systemic barriers. It proposes a framework requiring (1) transparency of process and pay; (2) regular self-assessment addressing milestones; and (3) a financial incentive for compliance. The framework can be used as a springboard to address other consequences of systemic discrimination in law firms, like the abysmal underrepresentation of women of color. This Article takes leaders of large law firms at their word and extends an invitation to advocate for state supreme courts, state bars, the American Bar Association, and state legislatures to implement the proposed framework and finally bring about an ethical reset aimed squarely at eliminating systemic discrimination and bias in large law firms.","LEE, KATRINA",,Clinical Professor of Law at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law
PLoS ONE,2021,3,Common pathways to Dean of Medicine at U.S. medical schools.,"Purpose: We sought to evaluate common leadership experiences and academic achievements obtained by current U.S. Medical School Deans of Medicine (DOMs) prior to their first appointment as Dean in order to elucidate a common pathway for promotion. Methods: In April-June 2019 the authors requested a curriculum vitae from each of the 153 LCME-accredited U.S. Medical School DOMs. The authors abstracted data on prior appointments, demographics, and achievements from CVs and online databases. Differences by gender and institutional rank were then evaluated by the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: CVs were obtained for 62% of DOMs (95 of 153), with women comprising 16% of the responding cohort (15/95). Prior to appointment as DOM, 34% of respondents had served as both permanent Department Chair and Associate Dean, 39% as permanent Department Chair but not Associate Dean, and 17% as Associate Deans but not permanent Department Chair. There was a non-significant trend for men to have been more likely to have been a permanent Department Chair (76% vs 53%, p = 0.11) and less likely to have been an Associate Dean (48% vs 67%, p = 0.26) compared to women. Responding DOMs at Top-25 research institutions were mostly male (15/16), more likely to have been appointed before 2010 (38% vs 14%, p = 0.025), and had higher H-indices (mean (SD): 73.1 (32.3) vs 33.5 (22.5), p<0.01) than non-Top-25 Deans. Conclusions: The most common pathway to DOM in this study cohort was prior service as Department Chair. This suggests that diversification among Department Chair positions or expansion of search criteria to seek leaders from pools other than Department Chairs may facilitate increased diversity, equity, and inclusion among DOM overall.","Jacobson, Clare E.","Beeler, Whitney H.","University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America"
Tulane Law Review,2021,3,The Human Capital Management Movement in U.S. Corporate Law.,"Corporations cannot exist without workers, yet workers are not part of the formal or informal governance structures established by U.S. corporate law. Commentators and policymakers have bemoaned this state of affairs for decades, to little avail. Since the mid-2010s, however, a concept related to workers, human capital management (HCM), has become an increasingly prominent part of U.S. corporate governance. HCM is premised on the notion that workers can be viewed as ""assets"" and ought to be managed just as carefully as firms manage physical and capital assets. In practice, HCM is an expansive concept that has been used to refer to workforce training, compensation and retention issues, gender pay equity, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, matters related to corporate culture, employees' ability to participate in stock purchase programs, and various other matters. The speed with which HCM has emerged and the depth and breadth of its reach have been surprising. While broadly fitting within the rubric of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, HCM has quickly surpassed more traditional ESG topics in terms of prominence and uptake. Boards of directors have started to focus on HCM as part of their monitoring and oversight responsibilities, including by amending committee charters to cover HCM matters. Investors are actively engaging with firm management and boards on questions pertaining to HCM. Despite its deregulatory posture at the time, in August 2020 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a new rule requiring HCM disclosure by public companies. Pending legislation could create HCM disclosure mandates that are considerably more extensive. A variety of private standard-setting organizations have developed detailed frameworks for HCM disclosure, and many firms have started reporting information in accordance with these frameworks. Taken together, these developments represent a powerful and heretofore unprecedented push to incorporate worker-related concerns in corporate governance--a phenomenon I term the ""HCM movement."" This Article is the first to delineate the HCM movement and analyze its origins, development, impact, and normative desirability. In the aftermath of the lingering economic dislocation caused by the 2008 financial crisis and the still-ongoing public health and economic crises unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a tangible willingness by policymakers, firms, investors, and others to reconceive institutional arrangements that have been taken for granted for decades. This Article's timely analysis of the HCM movement seeks to inform some of the attendant public and corporate governance policy choices. Subject to certain qualifications, the Article views HCM as a broadly positive and muchoverdue corporate governance development: HCM disclosure contributes to better and more accurate firm valuation by shining a spotlight on a key driver of success in the modern knowledge-based economy; HCM oversight at the board level ensures that boards focus appropriately on the management of what has come to be referred to as a ""mission-critical"" asset. To realize HCM's full promise, however, all participants in the HCM movement should seek to disambiguate the HCM concept by carefully defining it, breaking it down into its appropriate constitutive elements, and, to the extent possible, focusing the relevant discussions on those specific elements. The weight of the empirical evidence and the appropriate policies for corporate boards, the SEC, and private standard-setters will vary depending on which element is under consideration. In addition, boards should resist isomorphic approaches, particularly ones developed by organizations such as large asset managers that are lacking in regulatory legitimacy, accountability, and HCM expertise. The SEC can and should serve as a nexus for coordination among the various participants in the HCM movement. As a first step, the SEC should revisit the HCM disclosure rulemaking process and reject the unstructured, ""principles-based"" approach reflected in the August 2020 HCM disclosure rule, which is based on an impoverished understanding of the important concept of materiality. In its final part, the Article considers the limits of HCM and sounds a note of caution with respect to HCM's potential to address problems outside corporate law. The rise of the HCM movement has highlighted the need for a governmental human capital development and worker protection agenda; in other words, current socio-economic conditions likely require new measures aimed at the development and protection of human capital, not just its management.","Georgiev, George S.",,"Associate Professor, Emory University School of Law"

Social Work Education,2022,5,Assessing how social work programs use their websites to convey a commitment to social justice.,"Social justice is a key tenet for the social work profession and education, calling for commitment to working with and for vulnerable and oppressed populations. In fact, undergraduate and master’s programs are accredited by CSWE, in part, based on fulfilling educational competencies related to supporting diversity and advancing social justice. Websites are one critical avenue through which social work programs communicate a commitment to social justice and other social work values. This study is an examination of how social work programs use their websites to convey a commitment to social justice to prospective students. Programs were identified using CSWE’s accreditation list (N = 590). A social justice messaging index was created by coding program websites for five indicators: social justice language on the homepage; mission/vision statement includes social justice; evidence of a diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative; social justice language on all degree overview pages; and a social justice course required for all degrees. The most common indicator was inclusion of social justice in the programs’ mission or vision statements (43%). The least common was evidence of a diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative (10%). No school met all five criteria. Implications for social work education are discussed.","Aykanian, Amanda","Atteberry-Ash, Brittanie",University of Texas at Arlington
Psychology in the Schools,2022,7,Collaborative approaches to autism spectrum disorder assessment.,"With the rising prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), school and clinical psychologists must be abreast of the current research on assessment to determine diagnosis or educational eligibility. This is the first of a double special issue focusing on assessment of individuals with ASD. Within the school setting, collaboration is at the core of special education eligibility assessment. This introduction highlights the role of collaboration in the assessment process. Collaborative approaches help school psychologists determine the best assessment plan, understand the diversity, equity, and inclusive needs of children with ASD, and can assist in determining if alternative methods (i.e., telehealth) are appropriate. Practitioner Points: Interprofessional collaboration during an assessment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an important component of a comprehensive evaluation to assist in educational planning.Consideration of the diverse and individualized needs of students with ASD, including factors related to diversity, equity, and inclusion topics, helps school psychologists present the most comprehensive assessment of a child's strengths and weaknesses.Collaborative methods must consider changes in technology and how virtual assessment could be utilized in an evaluation of a child with ASD. Telehealth practices could expand services to children in underserved areas.","Dale, Brittany A.","Bray, Melissa A.","Department of Special Education, Ball State University, Muncie Indiana,, USA"
OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology,2022,6,"Women in Systems Science and Gender Parity: Why and How to Democratize the ""Technology, Innovation, and Society Nexus"".","A career in systems science offers exciting prospects as well as challenges around the world, which are often underexplored or unknown. Gender parity, diversity, inclusion, and equity are essential for knowledge production, systems science research, and innovation to be representative, democratic, and critically informed. By virtue of its focus on systems, omics science is ideally poised to understand and respond to systemic and structural issues that hinder gender parity, equity, and democracy in science and society. In this context, voices from women in systems science in resource-limited countries are often inaudible, a gap that this article aims to bridge. We present here some of the pressing issues and possible ways forward for equitable representation of women in science. We highlight emerging frontiers of systems science such as digital transformation, Industry 4.0, and cyber-physical systems where gender parity and equity are crucial. This article also examines some of the challenges faced by women scientists in Africa. All in all, much work is needed across communities and countries worldwide for diversity and gender equity in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)-based programs. Adapting a critical lens that examines power asymmetries in STEM in Africa and around the world, and new ways of thinking for bringing women scientists in Africa to leadership positions in traditional STEM fields such as computer science and engineering where large gender equity gaps exist, is a timely and principled necessity in 21st century science and society.","Hamdi, Yosr","Mulder, Nicola","Laboratory of Biomedical Genomics and Oncogenetics, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Université Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia."

Canadian Music Educator / Musicien Educateur au Canada,2020,10,(Self)Interview with an Autistic: Intrinsic Interest and Learning With and About Music and the Missing Modality of Sound.,"I am an autistic educator who educates nonautistic learners. My earliest experiences with music was as an external sound source; a record player. Music was physical and required a physical response, and I would run in circles or bounce and conduct. Music in school was nothing like that. Music was teacher directed; programmed to institutional norms, based on the goals, interests and needs of adults. It was not about helping children learn about something they are growing passionate about. If this is not the goal of teaching, what is the goal? Luckily for me, my intrinsic interest and motivation in creating sounds and music was strong enough that I worked to create situations for sound and music beyond organized music institutions. This article starts by situating myself as the autistic child working against the hegemonic influences of the educational institution; later as a youth forging a path that would lead to becoming an educator conceptualizing alternative ways of knowing about sound and music. It concludes with a provisional framework that challenges how we work with learners that attempts to work within the lenses of equity, diversity and inclusion to bring learning about sound and music to the widest possible number of children.","Nolan, Jason",,Professor of early childhood studies at Ryerson University

Annals of Family Medicine,2022,3,Moving Beyond Inquiry: Clinician Training Opportunities to Promote Racial Justice in Clinical Care.,"Context: The Presence 5 for Racial Justice (P5RJ), an adaptation of the Stanford Presence 5 framework practices, comprises anti-racism clinician communication practices that promote health equity and build trusting relationships with Black patients. Objective: We sought to identify specific statements and actions that clinicians use to promote racial justice in their clinical care. Study Design: Mixed-methods analysis of a survey, using deductive and inductive approaches to identify themes in qualitative data. Dataset: N=53 specific phrases provided in response to open-ended survey prompts related to the P5RJ practices. Population studied: N=50 respondents (27 clinicians, 17 medical trainees, and 6 unreported) recruited through convenience sampling and listservs of clinicians with expertise in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Respondents identified as Asian (9), Black/African American (10), Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish Origin (4), White/Caucasian (20), Write-in (1), and more than one race/ethnicity (6). Outcome Measures: Clinician statements were mapped to P5RJ domains and were categorized using Goffman's communication theory as 1) inquiry (e.g. ""What effect (if any) do you feel race has had on your health or your interactions with the health care system?""), 2) self-accountability (e.g. ""I am sorry I made that assumption""), 3) empathetic statements (e.g. ""You seem sad, but maybe I am misinterpreting that. How are you feeling?""), and/or 4) statements of allyship (e.g. ""Would you let me know if you feel you can't speak up and I will speak up for you?""). Results: Across all five practices, ""Inquiry"" was the predominant theme identified (58.5%), followed by ""Empathy"" (24.5%), ""Statements of Allyship"" (9.4%), and ""Self-Accountability"" (7.5%). 94% of respondents indicated diversity, equity, and inclusion involvement, and all respondents who provided specific phrases were in this category. Conclusions: Clinicians and medical trainees alike use inquiry as a predominant communication practice when addressing racism and promoting health equity. This may be due to a higher comfort level given the central role of question-asking during history-taking in medical training and clinical care. Our findings suggest an opportunity to focus anti-racism communication training on statements of empathy, self-accountability, and allyship. Future research is needed to evaluate patient preferences on appropriate types of clinician statements to promote health equity in clinical care.",,,

After multiple revisions, the final definition is as follows: School psychology research is the systematic investigation of phenomena concerning the educational, emotional, behavioral, and social outcomes, as well as the school, family, and societal systems in which these outcomes are imbedded. It is principally concerned with socially responsive implementation and translating research into equitable practices that can lead to improved functioning of students, families, schools, and community systems that support educational and psychological services. It includes basic and applied research and theory development that focuses on a wide array of topics including, for example, prevention, intervention, assessment, diagnosis, diversity, equity and inclusion, measurement, methodology, statistics, and professional issues. This wide range of topics is informed by diverse theories arising from a broad array of disciplines and investigated by researchers from a variety of educational and scientific backgrounds. Common to all of the areas of research inquiry is a focus on enhancing student, family, and community outcomes—particularly educational and social outcomes of all students—and in building the capacity of systems (schools, communities, and other systems) to support those outcomes with a commitment to incorporating social responsiveness in the research process. The aim of this definition is to embrace the breadth of scholarship informing and advancing the science, practice, and policy relevant to the field of school psychology.","Volpe, Robert J.","Chafouleas, Sandy M.","Department of Applied Psychology, Northeastern University"

Using Critical Discourse Analysis and Intersectional Analysis, this study offers a comparative exploration of institutional responses to two central and conflicting events that took place in the final year of the Trump administration: the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 and the insurrection at the Capitol in January 2021. In comparing how institutions addressed both events, we found that the statements issued in 2020 were what we defined as ""transformational"" while the 2021 statements engaged less with systemic injustice. This analysis provides a useful guideline for future studies to address the responses of administrators to national events that have had polarizing or psychological impacts on the higher education community and offers support for institutional leaders who wish to put their holistic selves in their writing to serve the institution's more progressive diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.","Johnson, Alexandria","Justice, Alexa","Georgia State University, GA, USA"
Orbit,2022,10,Gender and editorship in oculoplastics societal publications.,"The editorship of medical journals is a leadership role that can affect recognition and career advancement. We determine the gender representation of the editorial boards of oculoplastic surgery journals in comparison to the proportion of women in oculoplastics societies. The gender composition of the American, European and Asia-Pacific societies of oculoplastic and reconstructive surgery and the editorial boards of their respective society journals were determined with online searches in March 2021. Statistical tests for the equality of proportions were performed. Excluding 44 individuals with missing gender data, the three combined oculoplastics societies comprised 1,230 distinct members, with 29% women. The editorial review boards of the three official society publications comprised 59 medical editors, 22% of which were women. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of women editors versus women OPRS members (p =.201) but the study is underpowered to detect a 7% difference. A sensitivity analysis with the missing data did not alter the conclusions. The mean h-index/m-quotient of the women editors was 20.50/0.87 and for the men 21.05/0.84, with no statistically significant difference (p =.903/0.851) Women are underrepresented on the editorial boards of oculoplastic journals. Possible methods to improve gender balance include multicriteria objective decision-making criteria for editor nominations, mentoring peer reviewers that are women, and appointing a journal editor for equity, diversity and inclusion.","Ing, Edsel B.","Xu, Qinyuan","Ophthalmology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"
IASSIST Quarterly,2022,10,"Deficit, asset, or whole person? Institutional data practices that impact belongingness.","Given the capitalist model of higher education that has developed since the 1980s, the data collected by institutions of higher education on students is based on micro-targeting to understand and retain students as consumers, and to retain that customer base (i.e. to prevent attrition/dropouts). Institutional data has long been collected but the authors will question how, why, and for whom the data is collected in the current higher education model. The authors will then turn to the current higher education focus on equity, diversity, inclusion, and particularly on the concept of belongingness in higher education. The authors question the collective and local purposes of institutional data collection and the fallout of the current practices and will argue that using existing institutional data to facilitate student belongingness is impossible with current practices. We will propose a new framework of asset-minded institutional data practices that centers the student as a whole person and recenters data collection away from the concept of students as commodities. We propose a new framework based on data feminism that intends to elevate qualitative data and all persons/experiences along the bell-shaped curve, not just the middle two quadrants.","Johnson, Nastasha","Nelson, Megan Sapp",
AJOB Empirical Bioethics,2022,10,Diversity in IRB Membership: Views of IRB Chairpersons at U.S. Universities and Academic Medical Centers.,"Diversity in Institutional Review Board (IRB) membership is important for both intrinsic and instrumental reasons, including fairness, promoting trust, improving decision quality, and responding to systemic racism. Yet U.S. IRBs remain racially and ethnically homogeneous, even as gender diversity has improved. Little is known about IRB chairpersons' perspectives on membership diversity and barriers to increasing it, as well as current institutional efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within IRB membership. We surveyed IRB chairpersons leading U.S. boards registered with the Office for Human Research Protections. Here, we focus exclusively on responses from a subset of 388 chairpersons of IRBs at universities and academic medical centers (AMCs). Board chairs were predominantly white and evenly split between men and women. Only about half reported that their boards had at least one member who is Black or African American (51%), Asian (56%), or Hispanic (48%), with 85% of university/AMC boards comprised entirely (15%) or mostly (70%) of white members. Most IRB chairpersons (64%) reported satisfaction with the current diversity of their membership. Participants largely agreed that considering diversity in the selection of IRB members is important (91%), including to improve the quality of IRB deliberation (80%), with an emphasis on racial/ethnic (85%) and gender diversity (74%). Most participants (80%) reported some type of active DEI effort regarding board membership at their university/AMC and just over half (57%) expressed satisfaction with these efforts. Our national survey found that although university/AMC IRB chairpersons report valuing diversity in board membership, it may be lacking in key areas. Going forward, it will be important to specify clear reasons for diversity in the IRB context, as well to establish targets for acceptable levels of board diversity and to match DEI efforts to those targets.","Churchill, Sydney","Largent, Emily A.","Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA"

This article provides a virtual workshop model for integrating patient and public stakeholder perspectives in data analysis and interpretation. The model is based upon a critical reflection on the methods that underlaid the consultation stage of our scoping review on patient and caregiver preferences for cardiac surgery. It involves four virtual workshop sessions held on separate days, each achieving the unique goals of (a) establishing participants' technological literacy within the virtual platform, (b) obtaining responses to the research question, (c) introducing participant perspectives into research analysis and interpretation, and (d) prioritizing research findings or future research agendas. Further, a description of the considerations related to virtual engagement, including those pertaining to equity, diversity, and inclusion; features of the virtual platform; and roles for the research team are provided. This paper contributes toward a methodological toolkit for patient engagement in research, especially as an adjunct to research with otherwise minimal patient engagement.

"KULA: Knowledge Creation, Dissemination & Preservation Studies",2022,9,Ethical Considerations of Including Gender Information in Open Knowledge Platforms.,"In recent years, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) have sought to leverage open knowledge platforms such as Wikidata to highlight or provide more visibility for traditionally marginalized groups and their work, collections, or contributions. Efforts like Art + Feminism, local edit-a-thons, and, more recently, GLAM institution-led projects have promoted open knowledge initiatives to a broader audience of participants. One such open knowledge project, the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC) Wikidata Pilot, has brought together over seventy GLAM organizations to contribute linked open data for individuals associated with their institutions, collections, or archives. However, these projects have brought up ethical concerns around including potentially sensitive personal demographic information, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity, in entries in an open knowledge base about living persons. GLAM institutions are thus in a position of balancing open access with ethical cataloging, which should include adhering to the personal preferences of the individuals whose data is being shared. People working in libraries and archives have been increasingly focusing their energies on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in their descriptive practices, including remediating legacy data and addressing biased language. Moving this work into a more public sphere and scaling up in volume creates potential risks to the individuals being described. While adding demographic information on living people to open knowledge bases has the potential to enhance, highlight, and celebrate diversity, it could also potentially be used to the detriment of the subjects through surveillance and targeting activities. In this article we seek to investigate the changing role of metadata and open knowledge in addressing, or not addressing, issues of underand misrepresentation, especially as they pertain to gender identity as described in the sex or gender property in Wikidata. We report findings from a survey investigating how organizations participating in open knowledge projects are addressing ethical concerns around including personal demographic information as part of their projects, including what, if any, policies they have implemented and what implications these activities may have for the living people being described.","Lindsey, Nerissa","Suiter, Greta Kuriger",San Diego State University

Understanding practitioners' satisfaction with their evaluation processes and the drivers of this satisfaction may reveal strategies for improving evaluation processes in the field of EE. We administered an online survey to EE practitioners in the United States via email and social media. Our results indicate low satisfaction with evaluation processes overall, but greater satisfaction from organizations engaged in systematic formal evaluation, particularly processes focused on adaptive management and programmatic improvement, when compared to evaluations focused on satisfying external accountabilities or using informal evaluation processes based on nonsystematic observation and reflection.

Qualitative Health Research,2022,9,The Emotional and Psychological Labor of Insider Qualitative Research Among Systemically Marginalized Groups: Revisiting the Uses of Reflexivity.,"In response to decades-long exclusionary practices, academic institutions are now recruiting early career researchers (ECRs) from systemically marginalized populations who specialize in equity-related research. As a result, these ECRs are likely to conduct research within their communities on topics that have personal relevance—insider research. Methodological training for insider research places an emphasis on methods, such as reflexivity, to ensure rigor; however, the emotional and psychological impacts of these research methods on the researcher are seldom discussed. Therefore, I use analytic autoethnography to illustrate the embodied impacts of conducting insider research using an example of personal relevance and argue that methodological practices require an embodied reflexivity that centers the researcher and the impacts the research has on them. This paradoxically rewarding and taxing work necessitates changes in methodological training and practice, institutional support, and an openness to innovation when calling for equity, diversity, and inclusion in the academy.","Kinitz, David J.",,"Social and Behavioural Health Sciences Division, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, 7938 University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"

Journal of Library & Information Science in Agriculture,2022,9,Framework and Development Path of Open Science Capability.,"[Purpose/Significance] The aim of this paper is to identify open science capabilities and skills for researchers, build a capability framework of open science, and explore its development path, in order to improve the open science capabilities of team leaders and decision makers, researchers and scientific research support personnel in the open science ecosystem, and to provide reference for promoting open science and building an open science innovation ecosystem in our country. [Method/Process] In this paper, the relevant research on open science definition, open science capabilities, and competence model at home and abroad were analyzed and summarized. Based on the competency onion model, the open science capability framework was designed as three layers from the inside out: embracing open science values and principles and developing an open science mindset as the core layer, acquiring open science knowledge composed of open science elements as the second layer outside, and building open science skills embedded in the scientific research life cycle and data life cycle as the outermost layer. Then, the possible development methods were discussed. At last, libraries' role in the open science training was emphasized. [Results/Conclusions] The open science capability framework includes three dimensions. Firstly, embracing open science values, including quality and integrity, collective benefit, equity and fairness, and diversity and inclusiveness, and open science guiding principles covering transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility, equality of opportunities, responsibility, respect and accountability, collaboration, participation and inclusion, flexibility and sustainability. Secondly, acquiring open science knowledge based on open science elements, including open science definitions, initiatives, best practices, implications, open access, open data (scientific research data, government data, and industry data), open scientific and technological reports, open educational resources, open scientific infrastructure (virtual and physical), open source code, open reproducible research, open peer review, open science evaluation, citizen science, and open science policy. Thirdly, building open science core competencies embedded in scientific research lifecycle and data lifecycle, including (1) open scholarly communication skills, which mean open publication literacy skills, like making the correct choices about where and how to publish their results, how and what to self-archive and how to communicate their research for scholarly and societal impact; (2) data science skills, which mean data management plan, research data management, data analysis, data sharing, and data storage skills; (3) scientific research literacy skills, which mean research management skills, research integrity and ethics skills, and legal skills; (4) citizen science skills, which mean researchers learn how to engage with citizens, and citizens learn how to conduct research. The open science capability development path includes formulating relevant policies, laws and strategic plans for skills building, strengthening open science promotion and training, and providing comprehensive support throughout the entire scientific research process. At the same time, the library is a key player in the construction of open science capacity, and should lead the design of a scientific and rational open science training system, and play an active role in promoting the paradigm shift of open science. In addition, this research has shortcomings due to time limitation, and we will continue to conduct in-depth research on open science capabilities and refine its indicators, in order to provide theoretical basis and reference for libraries to design open science training system and promote open science training in China.",XIAO Man,WANG Xuan,"National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190"
Review of Higher Education,2022,9,"""We are a huge source of labor"": Exploring STEM Graduate Students' Roles in Changing Departmental Climate.","This qualitative case study was part of a larger, multi-year National Science Foundation funded project that centered upon a networked improvement community (NIC) of nine institutions seeking to improve racial climate in STEM graduate programs. We were particularly interested in the role of STEM graduate students at two NIC institutions in changing their departmental [End Page 33] climates and their experiences engaging in this work as they were socialized to their disciplines/fields. We found that STEM graduate students had a multifaceted role that combined being catalysts of change, laborers, and supplements for faculty. STEM graduate students, particularly racially minoritized women, were compelled to initiate change and to engage in labor to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, since they could not wait for faculty and administrators to act. While STEM graduate students used their agency to engage in work that they believed was necessary, it negatively affected their well-being and academic success, limited their access to professional opportunities, and unintentionally perpetuated faculty inaction. Our findings highlight the asymmetrical nature of bi-directional socialization since graduate students can initiate efforts to improve climate but have limited power to implement change. Furthermore, our work calls for faculty and administrators to fully take up the labor of improving racial climate and to alleviate the burdens placed upon graduate students.","Perez, Rosemary J.",,
Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal,2022,9,Reimagining Commitments to Patients and the Public in Professional Oaths.,"Robert Veatch argues that physician oaths should not be valued as substantive moral commitments, transformational rituals, or symbolic acts. Further, he insists that oath recitation in medical schools is immoral. I respond to Veatch's criticisms and argue that, with alterations to their content and practice, oaths can have value for articulating moral commitments and building a sense of moral community within the profession. I break down Veatch's multitude of objections to oaths over his career, and I suggest how medical schools can avoid the pitfalls identified by Veatch. A promising and innovative path forward is to integrate a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion—though with an understanding that a few lines in an oath are far from sufficient for institutional culture, faculty accountability, or students' education.","Guidry-Grimes, Laura",,

Disability & Rehabilitation,2022,8,Ableism within health care professions: a systematic review of the experiences and impact of discrimination against health care providers with disabilities.,"Abstract Purpose Methods Results Conclusions People with disabilities experience concerning rates of ableism and are significantly under-represented within healthcare education and professions. Focusing on healthcare professions is important for enhancing the diversity and inclusion of equity-deserving groups within the workforce. The objective of this review was to explore the experiences and impact of workplace discrimination and ableism among healthcare providers and trainees with disabilities.Systematic searches of seven databases from 2000 to January 2022 were conducted. Five reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted the data and rated the study quality.48 studies met our inclusion criteria, representing 13,815 participants across six countries over a 21-year period. The findings highlighted rates and types of workplace ableism, which occurred at the institutional (i.e., inaccessible environments, physical barriers and unsupportive work environments) and individual level (i.e., negative attitudes, bullying, harassment). The impact of ableism on healthcare providers included difficulty disclosing due to fear of stigma, and effects on well-being and career development.Our findings revealed a critical need for more research on the experiences of ableism amongst healthcare providers and the impact it has on their well-being. Further efforts should explore mechanisms for including and welcoming people with disabilities in healthcare professions. Implications for rehabilitation Workplace ableism is prevalent in health care professions and could be discouraging people with disabilities from entering or completing health care education and training, leading to an under-representation of this equity-deserving group within health care. More efforts are needed to recruit, retain and support people with disabilities in the health care workforce. Health care providers who have a disability often experience workplace discrimination and inaccessible physical environments which can impact their health and well-being. Managers, senior leadership and health care organizations should advocate for improved social inclusion of employees with disabilities.

Teachers College Record,2022,8,"""We Have No 'Visibly' Trans Students in Our School"": Educators' Perspectives on Transgender-Affirmative Policies in Schools.","Background/Context: In Ontario, and Canada more broadly, anti-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression is enshrined in the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which have required schools to address trans inclusion. However, the ways in which educators understand or enact these policies, and whether they are even aware of them, remain largely underexplored. Purpose/Research Question/Focus of Study: Our purpose was to learn more about educators' awareness and understanding of trans-inclusive policies in schools and the extent to which such policies were informing practice. Participants: While this research is based on survey data comprising 1,194 respondents, this article examines comments provided about trans-affirmative policy from 463 educators. Research Design: This study involves large-scale survey research conducted on 1,194 educators in Ontario K–12 schools; the survey was disseminated via social media and educational affiliates. We draw primarily on the qualitative data component of the survey, where educators provided detailed comments about and insights into trans-inclusive policies. We employed a reflexive approach to coding and thematic analysis to identify key themes. Findings/Results: Although our quantitative data depicted a favorable assessment of support for trans-affirmative policies—94% of respondents found their school's policy to be very or somewhat relevant—our findings highlight a discrepancy between policy and practice, and a lack of commitment to addressing cisgenderist, cisnormative, and cissexist systems. The themes that emerged from our coding and analysis of the qualitative data were: (1) educators' understanding of policy as accommodation; (2) individualized approaches to trans inclusion; (3) lack of administrative support and intervention; (4) the gap between policy and practice; (5) transphobic and cissexist resistance to supporting gender diversity; (6) the need for trans-affirming and gender-expansive curriculum, and (7) the problem of generalized approaches to equity and acceptance of diversity. In addition, we discuss several educator comments that raise important questions about race and the need for intersectional approaches to addressing equity and trans inclusion in schools. Conclusions/Recommendations: We advocate for a paradigm shift with respect to the necessity of employing a trans epistemological framework that addresses the need for gender-expansive education which focuses on the harmful effects of cisgenderism, cisnormativity, and cissexism in the education system. Central to addressing gender justice and trans marginalization in schools for all students, we conclude, is the need for policy makers to ensure accountability and budgetary allocation for the provision of resources and professional development for educators in schools.","Martino, Wayne","Omercajic, Kenan","The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada"
Collection & Curation,2022,7,Barriers to an inclusive academic library collection.,"Purpose: Libraries still endeavor to achieve diversity in many areas, including collections. Although many barriers to realizing this goal still exist, there are changes that can be made to improve the current situation. This paper aims to examine those barriers and discusses some ways librarians, administrators and publishers can help build inclusive academic library collections. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will discuss the issues that the University of North Florida's Thomas G. Carpenter Library discovered while trying to find ways to build a racially and ethnically diverse academic collection. Findings: The lack of diversity in academic library collections has many causes, including inadequate institutional collection priorities, librarian bias, heavy workloads and the dearth of diverse voices in the publishing industry. Originality/value: Diversity, equity and inclusion are key concepts to improving how libraries operate. However, libraries have struggled to realize this vision in many areas. This paper endeavors to identify ways academic librarians and publishers can make collections more diverse.","Price, Apryl C.",,"Thomas G.

AEM Education & Training,2022,6,Sex and race visual representation in emergency medicine textbooks and the hidden curriculum.,"Introduction: In addition to formal training, informal training often occurs through a hidden curriculum. As the hidden curriculum shapes the knowledge and values held by learners, we must consider its role in implicit bias. One example is through the selection of images used in formal instruction. This study aimed to examine the representation of sex and race among images in two textbooks in emergency medicine (EM). Methods: We performed a cross‐sectional study of the sex and race representation of figures in Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice 9th Edition and Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide 9th Edition. Two reviewers screened all images for inclusion, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Images were excluded if they did not include visualized skin. Two reviewers independently reviewed each image and assessed the sex, race, and roles in the image. A third reviewer resolved any disagreements. Results: A total of 959 images (Rosen's n = 377; Tintinalli's n = 582) met inclusion criteria. Race was estimated in 877 cases (91.3%). Of those, White individuals comprised 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.0%–80.2%). Sex was estimated in 362 cases (37.7%). Of those images, males comprised 70.2% (95% CI 65.4%–74.9%), and females comprised 29.8% (95% CI 25.1%–34.6%). Conclusion: There is a male sex and White race predominance in visual representation among two EM textbooks. We propose a call to action for the mindful selection of images in formal education to represent diversity, equity, and inclusion and close the gap between the formal and hidden curriculum.","Kalantari, Annahieta","Alvarez, Al'ai","Department of Emergency Medicine, Penn State Health Milton S Hershey Medical Center, Hershey Pennsylvania,, USA"
ANZ Journal of Surgery,2021,10,"""The odds were stacked against me"": a qualitative study of underrepresented minorities in surgical training.","Background: The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) is expected to provide surgical care to a diverse patient population across Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). To improve the quality‐of‐care individuals receive, the surgical workforce must reflect the population it serves. Achieving diversity within RACS will strengthen therapeutic relationships with patients and promote an inclusive culture. This study investigates the perspectives of underrepresented minority (URM) trainees to highlight barriers for the selection and completion of the RACS Surgical Education and Training (SET) program. Methods: This qualitative study used online, semi‐structured, in‐depth interviews of URM trainees. Participants were recruited by self‐identification and were invited to participate based on inclusion criterion. Interviews took place between August and October 2020, were transcribed and de‐identified. Framework analysis was used to identify themes. Findings: Eight participants from four surgical specialities were interviewed, six from Australia and two from New Zealand. There were six female and two male participants. The findings identified barriers that were grouped into eight broad areas: discouragement; structural racism, discrimination and unconscious bias; language barriers; policies and procedures; lack of role models; homophobia; sexual harassment and women in surgery. Conclusion: The findings offer guidance to RACS and the surgical community to explore new strategies to improve the experience of URM SET trainees. While on a small scale, the study draws directly on the URMs' experiences to inform strategies addressing equity, diversity and inclusion. The aim is to produce a diverse surgical workforce that better delivers healthcare services to a diverse population.","Villanueva, Claudia","Cain, Justin","Cardiothoracic Surgery, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle New South Wales,, Australia"

International Journal of Integrated Care (IJIC),2022,10,"Creating, co-designing and piloting a community assessment tool for integrated care networks.","Introduction: Integrated care networks (ICNs) are rising in the health policy landscape as new promising delivery systems that provide better connected, seamless and responsive patientcentred care and services to local populations. With community engagement at its core, this new model brings health and social service providers and patients together in order to design population health-based solutions to care. Robust, representative, and evidence-based engagement is critical to the success of ICNs. However, to this day, few attempts have been made to develop researchbased assessment tools that measure the nature of existing community engagement structures amongst ICN partners. Aims, Objectives, Theory or Methods: Building on a scoping review and empirical data we aim to demonstrate to integrated health system practitioners an evidence-based community engagement assessment tool. This tool can help identify pools of prospective community members and delineate evidence-based approaches to communication and engagement. We systematically investigated bibliographic databases to search, screen and select relevant literature on integrated care community engagement. The preliminary tool was then reviewed and further developed by integrated health partners, patients, and academic advisors before its pilot with integrated health partners. Given that development of this tool is at a pilot stage, ICIC session attendees will also be invited to offer feedback during and after the conference presentation. Highlights or Results or Key Findings: First, the presentation will show features of The Community Assessment Tool. This includes a series of open and closed-ended (binary and Likert scale) questions that are to be administered to the partners within ICNs who are known to regularly interface with patients, caregivers, volunteers and community members. It will also show how principles for effective community engagement including equity, diversity and inclusion and access to engagement, in addition to theories of community organization and community building have been incorporated. The tool will be displayed on the digital platform used to pilot it in three integrated care networks in early 2022 in Ontario ('Ontario Health Teams'). Next it will offer methodological insights on developing assessment tools in addition to recommendations for future practice emanating from its community co-design and pilot phases. Finally we will share preliminary results from the pilot and demonstrate how this data will inform and impact community engagement strategy and mapping. Conclusions: Building on partners' strengths is a common approach when implementing innovative approaches across network structures. Consequently, before each integrated care network starts its community engagement activities, it is critical to create a window of equal opportunity through which to understand existing community engagement structures amongst its partners using standardized techniques. Implications for applicability/transferability, sustainability, and limitations: This tool has the potential inform and guide community engagement activities by filling a current critical gap; the rapid assessment of existing community engagement structures and activities amongst partner organizations within an integrated care network. It's function ultimately supports fulsome engagement reflective of the whole community that networks are designed to serve.","Dimitra Montgomery, Natalie","Abdelhalim, Reham","University Of Toronto, Canada"

One such injustice is ""identity-based service,"" service labor that is expected from marginalized scholars but not from those with majority identities. This article proposes a new framework for identity-based service in which academic institutions distribute and value this labor more equitably. First, I explore the concept of identity-based service and the burden it places on Black and otherwise marginalized, or ""diverse,"" scholars. Second, I offer both short- and long-term actionable strategies for addressing the problems stemming from Identity-based service, all of which involve either a redistribution or revaluation of this labor. Third, I map my arguments and those of other outspoken music scholars onto the Society for Music Theory's recent ethical affirmations and commitments to encourage action that supplements the Society's existing initiatives toward diversity, equity, and inclusion. I ultimately contend that through collective action we music theorists can cultivate an academic community that successfully retains those it claims to value as scholars, teachers, and change agents.","Boyd, Clifton",,

Cultural Studies/Critical Methodologies,2022,12,A Warning/A Call: The Spectacle of (In)Visibility in the Vernacular Response to DEI-A Work.,"This short piece was originally conceptualized as a response and support of a young tenure-track faculty-of-color who was experiencing academic bullying and threat of recrimination for her unwavering work in DEI-A (diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism) in an academic unit that claims to support the work of decolonizing its curriculum. But also, a unit in which some seemingly resist personal challenge and the necessary self-work that differentially inconveniences majority students and faculty. The response of resistance becomes the vernacular of dis-ease that interrupts DEI-A work in a liberal economy. This commentary, which extends beyond the place and space of this encounter, speaks to what might be national tensions between the cultural sustainability of privilege and cultural transformation for social justice. This piece also evidences the importance of academic administrators being able to articulate and strengthen their own commitments to DEI-A, to support faculty in the collective struggle of our academic and political defensive labor for social justice. This recognizing that none of us are immune to the sting of critique in defense of our convictions and that of our university values.","Alexander, Bryant Keith",,"Loyola Marymount University College of Communication and Fine Arts, Los Angeles, CA, USA"

Fertility & Sterility,2021,8,The pipeline problem: barriers to access of Black patients and providers in reproductive medicine.,"The demographics of the United States are rapidly changing, and our health care workforce is not keeping pace with the population trends. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (formerly The American Fertility Society) recognizes the need to increase diversity and is committed to promoting diversity across our membership and leadership as well as promoting equitable quality reproductive care to all patients. In the fall of 2020, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine convened a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force to evaluate and make recommendations on the basis of findings to increase diversity to achieve equity and inclusion of reproductive and infertility services for all women. This article focuses on specific barriers that Black or African American patients face in accessing quality care and that provider's face in training and inclusion in reproductive medicine. Multiple publications have confirmed an improvement in health outcome when there is congruence between the patient and the provider. There is a stark contrast between the racial and ethnic diversity of our providers and other support personnel compared with that of our patients. Despite our best intent to minimize the effects of implicit and explicit bias, mistrust and misunderstandings when there is discordance between patients and providers negatively impacts care. To increase provider diversity, it is crucial that we prioritize pipeline programs that recruit and support underrepresented minority in medicine physicians. Specific recommendations are made to increase diversity in the pipeline to improve patient access to culturally competent quality reproductive medicine care with optimal outcomes.","Richard-Davis, Gloria",,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Division for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas"

International Journal of Information & Learning Technology,2020,1,Online learning for social justice and inclusion: The role of technological tools in graduate student learning.,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the online pedagogical practices and technological tools that influenced the attainment of skills and knowledge associated with professional multicultural competence in a graduate student online course focused on social justice and inclusion. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative case study includes a total of ten student participants. Two theoretical orientations guide the study. Mishra and Koehler's (2006) model of technological pedagogical content knowledge is provided to understand the reciprocal relationship between content, pedagogy, knowledge and technology in online learning environments. Critical digital pedagogy (Morris and Stommel, 2018) provides insights into challenging the neutrality of technological tools and focuses on relational capacities of online learning environments. Initial coding by each researcher was reduced to thematic codes focused on technological tools, course content delivery, asynchronous and synchronous pedagogical strategies. Findings: Data analysis revealed technological tools such as discussion boards, video, video conferencing and synchronous opportunities influence student engagement and learning. Further, findings reveal that the nature of online education itself – specifically asynchronocity – functions as both a distraction and possibility for online learning in multicultural education courses. Students in this study revealed the value of opportunities to engage synchronously in online learning environments. Instruction without such opportunities was disadvantageous to the learning of skills and knowledge associated with multicultural competence. Research limitations/implications: The study is not generalizable to the experiences of all online students and only provides a small cross-section of online graduate students enrolled in a required diversity course at one institution. Originality/value: There is a dearth of research focused on teaching courses in diversity, equity, social justice and inclusion in fully online environments, a gap this study begins to fill. The study also enhances the authors' understanding of graduate student education.","Montelongo, Ricardo","Eaton, Paul William","Department of Educational Leadership, College of Education, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, USA"

Paradoxically, men's advocacy for gender-equity often unintentionally conveys gendered biases. We therefore assert that the development of conscientização or critical consciousness in people who identify as men must be explicitly addressed if policies and practices are to be effectively transformed to achieve gender equity. That is, men must come to the recognition that their own best interests are served by the unravelling of gendered systems where unearned over-advantaging for men abounds.","Anicha, Cali L.","Bilen-Green, Canan","Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs and Equity, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"

PLoS Computational Biology,2020,10,Ten simple rules for building an antiracist lab.,"Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.","Chaudhary, V.

Medical Teacher,2020,9,The DISCuSS model: Creating connections between community and curriculum – A new lens for curricular development in support of social accountability.,"Medicine's social mandate recognizes the importance of introducing changes to systems and practices to meet the healthcare needs of marginalized populations. Social accountability efforts encompass a wide array of actions, including equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and adapting knowledge relevant to practice across education, research, and clinical domains. To influence change in education, ongoing structures and processes are needed to ensure adequacy, relevance, and effectiveness of curricular coverage. In support of this, we created an innovative and creative approach to developing curricular modules to prepare medical students to provide care that is responsive to the cultural, economic, and psychosocial realities of diverse patient populations. The DISCuSS model (Diversity, Identify, Search, Create module (with community engagement), Sustainability, Social accountability) provides a community-engaged, iterative approach to curriculum development relevant to social accountability. Over the past 5 years, we have created nine curricular modules focused on health-related inequities and social concerns, including modules on Indigenous and refugee health, sexual and gender minority health, human trafficking, and addiction. AFMC Graduation Questionnaire results have shown a statistically significant increase in our students 'preparedness to provide care to diverse populations.' The DISCuSS model, which continues to evolve, can be adapted and used in other settings.","Goez, Helly","Lai, Hollis","Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"

Proceedings of the Association for Information Science & Technology,2021,10,Teaching with Color: Calling in White Faculty to Address Whiteness in the LIS Curriculum.,"Diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) issues underlie the systemic problems affecting our society, including the critical lack of inclusion within the field of librarianship. All LIS faculty must prepare students to work with diverse populations of both patrons and colleagues and should aim to strengthen students' cultural competence by incorporating DEIJ issues and concepts into the curriculum. However, in a field that is overwhelmingly white, there are sure to be missteps as white faculty develop their own cultural competency through research, teaching, and interpersonal interaction. In this poster, we argue for increased transparency amongst white LIS faculty who seek to incorporate DEIJ concepts into their courses. We additionally encourage faculty to prioritize student involvement and feedback while integrating DEIJ‐related theory and topics into the LIS curriculum. Finally, we argue that open discussion between white faculty and students of color is necessary for the field's ongoing progress towards equity.","De La Rosa, Sarah","Simons, Rachel N.","Texas Woman's University, Denton TX, , USA"

Nicotine & Tobacco Research,2022,5,"Assessing Sex, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, Race, Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Status, and Mental Health Concerns in Tobacco Use Disorder Treatment Research: Measurement Challenges and Recommendations From a Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Pre-conference Workshop.","This paper reports on topics discussed at a Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco pre-conference workshop at the 2019 annual Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco meeting. The goal of the pre-conference workshop was to help develop a shared understanding of the importance of several tobacco-related priority groups in tobacco use disorder (TUD) treatment research and to highlight challenges in measurement related to these groups. The workshop focused on persons with minoritized sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation identities; persons with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds; persons with lower socioeconomic status (SES); and persons with mental health concerns. In addition to experiencing commercial tobacco-related health disparities, these groups are also underrepresented in tobacco research, including TUD treatment studies. Importantly, there is wide variation in how and whether researchers are identifying variation within these priority groups. Best practices for measuring and reporting sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, SES, and mental health concerns in TUD treatment research are needed. This paper provides information about measurement challenges when including these groups in TUD treatment research and specific recommendations about how to measure these groups and assess potential disparities in outcomes. The goal of this paper is to encourage TUD treatment researchers to use measurement best practices in these priority groups in an effort to conduct meaningful and equity-promoting research. Increasing the inclusion and visibility of these groups in TUD treatment research will help to move the field forward in decreasing tobacco-related health disparities. Implications: Tobacco-related disparities exist for a number of priority groups including, among others, women, individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities, individuals with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds, individuals with lower SES, and individuals with mental health concerns. Research on TUD treatments for many of these subgroups is lacking. Accurate assessment and consideration of these subgroups will provide needed information about efficacious and effective TUD treatments, about potential mediators and moderators, and for accurately describing study samples, all critical elements for reducing tobacco-related disparities, and improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in TUD treatment research.","Weinberger, Andrea H","Steinberg, Marc L","Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University , Bronx, NY , USA"
Bulletin of Volcanology,2022,5,Volcano infrasound: progress and future directions.,"Over the past two decades (2000–2020), volcano infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies less than 20 Hz propagating in the atmosphere) has evolved from an area of academic research to a useful monitoring tool. As a result, infrasound is routinely used by volcano observatories around the world to detect, locate, and characterize volcanic activity. It is particularly useful in confirming subaerial activity and monitoring remote eruptions, and it has shown promise in forecasting paroxysmal activity at open-vent systems. Fundamental research on volcano infrasound is providing substantial new insights on eruption dynamics and volcanic processes and will continue to do so over the next decade. The increased availability of infrasound sensors will expand observations of varied eruption styles, and the associated increase in data volume will make machine learning workflows more feasible. More sophisticated modeling will be applied to examine infrasound source and propagation effects from local to global distances, leading to improved infrasound-derived estimates of eruption properties. Future work will use infrasound to detect, locate, and characterize moving flows, such as pyroclastic density currents, lahars, rockfalls, lava flows, and avalanches. Infrasound observations will be further integrated with other data streams, such as seismic, ground- and satellite-based thermal and visual imagery, geodetic, lightning, and gas data. The volcano infrasound community should continue efforts to make data and codes accessible and to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field. In summary, the next decade of volcano infrasound research will continue to advance our understanding of complex volcano processes through increased data availability, sensor technologies, enhanced modeling capabilities, and novel data analysis methods that will improve hazard detection and mitigation.","Watson, Leighton M.","Iezzi, Alexandra M.","Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA"
Earth & Space Science,2022,5,"Geoscience Education Perspectives on Integrated, Coordinated, Open, Networked (ICON) Science.","Practitioners and researchers in geoscience education embrace collaboration applying ICON (Integrated, Coordinated, Open science, and Networked) principles and approaches which have been used to create and share large collections of educational resources, to move forward collective priorities, and to foster peer‐learning among educators. These strategies can also support the advancement of coproduction between geoscientists and diverse communities. For this reason, many authors from the geoscience education community have co‐created three commentaries on the use and future of ICON in geoscience education. We envision that sharing our expertise with ICON practice will be useful to other geoscience communities seeking to strengthen collaboration. Geoscience education brings substantial expertise in social science research and its application to building individual and collective capacity to address earth sustainability and equity issues at local to global scales The geoscience education community has expanded its own ICON capacity through access to and use of shared resources and research findings, enhancing data sharing and publication, and leadership development. We prioritize continued use of ICON principles to develop effective and inclusive communities that increase equity in geoscience education and beyond, support leadership and full participation of systemically non‐dominant groups and enable global discussions and collaborations. Plain Language Summary: The Geoscience Education community describes the value, use, and future of ICON collaboration through three independent, community‐produced commentaries focused on the practice of geoscience education; geoscience education research; and diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. Each commentary offers ideas important to building inclusive and effective communities. These ideas apply to science‐community collaboration broadly and inform coproduction and network building activities within and across geoscience‐public boundaries. The expansion of inclusive and effective networks is needed for equitable outcomes. Key Points: Integrated, Coordinated, Open science, and Networked (ICON) principles and practices are widely used in geoscience education to improve both research and practiceStrengthened capacity for ICON practices is needed to advance current educational prioritiesA priority must be placed on full participation by that are systemically non‐dominant groups and improving global interactions","Fortner, Sarah K.","Manduca, Cathryn A.","Science Education Resource Center, Carleton College, Northfield MN,, USA"
Public Services Quarterly,2022,4,Equity work in a health sciences library.,"Diversity, equity and inclusion have become buzz words over the last year. While this is important, it is necessary that library staff do not move on from the vision of these words. Equity, much like the health of a person, is holistic. It is not just having a book club on race issues or celebrating Black History Month; equity is evaluating each aspect of the opportunities and power libraries and library staff possess and continually working toward a place of diversity, inclusion, accessibility, and tools that level the inequities. This paper will show how librarians and health equity fellows proactively carried out an initiative for health equity to support the campus vision, and translated this vision into practical steps that work toward equity for the community they serve. This work included acknowledging shortcomings, locating gift funds, conducting a needs analysis of the collection, providing resources and other services, and offering fellowships for graduated students to perform these duties.","Phillips, Casey",,"School of Information Science & Learning Technologies, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA"

Although this origin story is often noted, the implications of NIME's history as emerging from a field predominantly dealing with human–computer interaction (HCI) have rarely been discussed. In this paper we highlight many of the recent—and some not so recent—challenges that have been brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of the neoliberal university—which have underpinned academia's drive for innovation—and the quantification and economization of research performance that have facilitated certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies, we suggest that critical reflection and, moreover, mediation is necessary to address burgeoning concerns that have been raised within the NIME discourse in relation to methodological approaches, ""equity, diversity, and inclusion,"" ""accessibility,"" and the fostering of ""rigorous"" interdisciplinary research.","Hayes, Lauren","Marquez-Borbon, Adnan","School of Arts, Media and Engineering Arizona State University Stauffer B, 950 South Forest Mall, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA"

International Journal of Qualitative Methods,2022,8,"A Virtual, Multi-Session Workshop Model for Integrating Patient and Public Perspectives in Research Analysis and Interpretation.","The importance and value of engaging patients and the public as co-researchers (i.e., ""patient engagement in research"") is becoming more evident, and guiding methods must be available for researchers conducting their work at different points along the engagement spectrum. This article provides a virtual workshop model for integrating patient and public stakeholder perspectives in data analysis and interpretation. The model is based upon a critical reflection on the methods that underlaid the consultation stage of our scoping review on patient and caregiver preferences for cardiac surgery. It involves four virtual workshop sessions held on separate days, each achieving the unique goals of (a) establishing participants' technological literacy within the virtual platform, (b) obtaining responses to the research question, (c) introducing participant perspectives into research analysis and interpretation, and (d) prioritizing research findings or future research agendas. Further, a description of the considerations related to virtual engagement, including those pertaining to equity, diversity, and inclusion; features of the virtual platform; and roles for the research team are provided. This paper contributes toward a methodological toolkit for patient engagement in research, especially as an adjunct to research with otherwise minimal patient engagement. It also adds to the emerging literature on practical approaches to patient engagement in research as more engagement is occurring virtually.","Oravec, Nebojša","Schultz, Annette S.H.","Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, 8664 University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"
Fisheries,2022,8,What's in a Fish Species Name and When to Change It?,"Honorific scientific names have recently received intense scrutiny because societal values have changed. Across disciplines groundswells of support for renaming species have occurred; specifically those named after dishonorable people or with culturally inappropriate common names. Fishes have not been immune to this attention, but changes have come slowly. Now is the time for AFS to confront this controversial topic. The renaming processes can be aided by examining what other organizations have done. First, AFS should develop procedures for renaming species epithets and common names for species named after people who advocated racist and/or sexist views, used derogatory names in their writings, or did reprehensible things. Second, this process should include input from fisheries professionals who have to work with these names within the context of fisheries management, the AFS Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, and Indigenous peoples. Third, ichthyologists should change how their newly described species are named. As descriptions are written, an opportunity presents itself to name species with names of Indigenous peoples or after people that more closely represent the value sets of our society and profession. North Carolina, with its specious freshwater fish fauna, can serve as an illustrative case study of controversial fish names that warrant this discussion.",,,

Journal of Graphic Novels & Comics,2022,8,"Fashioning Africanfuturism: African comics, Afrofuturism, and Nnedi Okorafor's Shuri.","Internationally renowned Nigerian-American sci-fi writer Nnedi Okorafor recently wrote that she no longer wants her work to be considered Afrofuturism, preferring her own term Africanfuturism. Okorafor argues that despite the potential for Afrofuturism to underscore global Blackness, in practice it has privileged African American concerns while marginalising those of Africa. Okorafor, whose work includes several comics including Black Panther, Shuri, and LaGuardia, argues that her work should be understood as explicitly African rather than part of the Black diaspora. She puts this notion into practice by writing novels and comics set in Africa with African characters 'sometimes with aliens, sometimes with witches, often set in a recognizable, future Africa, with African lineages – that are not cultural hybrids but rooted in the history and traditions of the continent, without a desire to look toward Western culture.' Okorafor's need to assert the notion of Africa as an important site of Blackness in comics highlights the marginal standing of representations of Africa in discourses of global Blackness in comics, even in the contemporary era of diversity, inclusion, and equity. This article examines Okorafor's Marvel comic Shuri to further elucidate Africanfuturism and consider the concept as a paradigm for approaching African comic content.","Hodapp, James",,"Liberal Arts Program, Northwestern University in Qatar, Doha, Qatar"
JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2022,8,Improving Patient Advocacy in NCI Scientific Steering Committees and Task Forces.,"This commentary discusses improving research advocacy as part of National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trial activities in scientific steering committees and task forces between 2016 and 2020. Before 2016, the focus of patient advocate input on clinical trial concept evaluation was assessing accrual feasibility. By leveraging informal benchmarking and an outside-in perspective, the NCI patient advocate steering committee, comprised of NCI scientific steering committee and task force advocates, has recalibrated research advocacy within and across its clinical trial concepts. Additionally, by focusing on research advocacy fundamentals, the NCI patient advocate steering committee clarified the scope of the research advocate roles, focused its mission, defined and developed competencies, measured engagement, and created collateral and processes that support better interactions and greater value generation. Continuous improvement in the collateral and the underlying approaches, along with calibrating their application and monitoring results, will be necessary to keep pace with the science and further enhance the value of cancer clinical trial research advocacy. The road ahead should build on these fundamentals and include increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical trial and research advocacy participants and the supporting infrastructure.","Bangs, Rick","Lynn, Jean M","South West Oncology Group Cancer Research Network , Portland, OR, USA"
Journal of Latinos & Education,2022,7,Understanding Latinas/os/xs Undergraduate Experiences in a Business School through the Working Identity Lens.,"Our study presents some of the voces of Latinas/os/xs undergraduates in a western U.S. business school to explore the concept of “working identity” in employment discrimination law under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. While overt racial discrimination is outlawed, racial salience through factors such as phenotype, accent, demeanor, associations and assimilation all impact the way employers see potential applicants and fit with future corporate job roles. We used this conceptual framework to gain insights into ways that some Latinas/os/xs students initially experienced the pressure of “working identity” through their education in schools of business. We selected students majoring in business because it is a popular major and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts have taken hold in business school contexts. The five participants in our study were majoring in accounting, business administration and management, and preparing for their future as employees in the business world. The first part of our paper provides an overview of the context of business schools and diversity; research on Latina/o/x student experiences in higher education, and the significance of the “working identity” concept; followed by our methods section, results and interpretation of how the pressures to perform working identity negatively impacts Latinas/os/x students.","Flores Mena, Ariel","Parker, Laurence",University of California Berkeley Law
Journal of Criminal Justice Education,2022,7,The State of Diversity in Criminal Justice Higher Education: An Analysis of Curricula in Criminal Justice Bachelor’s Degree Programs.,"Abstract The study examines diversity-themed course offerings in criminal justice and criminology (CJC) bachelor’s degree programs in the United States in 2020–21. Using a sample of 359 CJC programs, we document the presence of diversity-themed courses and degree requirements using data collected from university websites. We explore patterns of diversity-themed courses by department and institutional characteristics and assess the current state of diversity curricula in the discipline of criminal justice and criminology. Results of our analysis reveal that a substantial majority (75 percent) of CJC programs possessed at least one diversity-themed course while only 12 percent required students to complete a diversity-themed course in the major. We consider what these and related findings mean for the discipline in light of previous research and discuss the importance of developing student competencies in racial, gender, and other dimensions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the contemporary context of American criminal justice.","Miller, Kirk","Alves, Elizabeth","Department of Sociology, East Carolina University"
European Spatial Research & Policy,2022,7,SUSTAINABILITY OF STUDIES ON SUSTAINABLE TOURISM: A BIBLIOMETRIC APPROACH.,"The core values of sustainability should be emphasised: economic development, social inclusion, equity as well as diversity, and environmental protection. Those values should be reflected in various characteristics of studies on sustainable tourism. And this is the question we ask in our paper: are the studies of sustainable tourism sustainable? To address that question, we applied a bibliometric analysis of papers published within the last ten years in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism, the most influential scientific journal strictly focused on sustainable tourism issues. The analysis has revealed some doubts related to financial support for the research presented in the papers published, open access to the investigated articles, the differentiation of scientific disciplines whose achievements are presented, the expected methodological triangulation applied in the investigated papers, spatial volatility of case study areas in empirical works presented in the journal and, finally, the Anglo-American domination in the discourse on sustainable tourism.","NAPIERAŁA, Tomasz","LEŚNIEWSKA-NAPIERAŁA, Katarzyna","University of Lodz, Faculty of Geographical Sciences, ul.

Nursing Inquiry,2022,7,Thinking rhizomatically and becoming successful with disabled students in the accommodations assemblage: Using storytelling as method.,"The number of disabled students enrolled in higher education institutions is increasing. Yet in disciplines such as nursing, where placements are an important part of student success, students' lived experiences, though an important and necessary aspect of promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion, has been ignored. In this paper, we respond to such issues by creating and utilizing a novel storytelling method that harnesses the antiessentialist philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Storytelling empowers students to both describe their experiences and inform institutions on how to better serve them, and we use concepts from Deleuze and Guattari to provide a framework for thinking about students and their pathways toward success as multiple. As we show, applying storytelling as a method through this lens offers an expansion of strategies to put students first and, therefore, promote equity at the administrative, research, educational, and practical levels. We describe how thinking rhizomatically opens new avenues of insight, allowing for the creation of institutional assemblages based on a diverse array of students' needs, enabling them to become successful in their own ways.","Epstein, Iris","Rose, Jarrett R.","School of Nursing, York University, Toronto Ontario,, Canada"
Social Sciences (2076-0760),2022,7,Evaluation of Publicly Accessible Child Protection in Sport Education and Reporting Initiatives.,"Despite sport being a vehicle through which youth may achieve positive developmental outcomes, maltreatment in the youth sport context remains a significant concern. With increased athlete advocacy and research demonstrating the high prevalence of maltreatment in sport, and the urgent need to address it, many international organisations have created child protection in sport initiatives. Of particular focus to athletes and researchers is the provision of evidence-based comprehensive education and independent reporting mechanisms for athletes who experience harm. The current study examined the extent to which the publicly accessible information provided by three sport-specific child protection organisations regarding education and reporting is aligned with recommendations provided by researchers and athletes. With regard to education, the findings highlight accessibility, programming for various stakeholders, and coverage of topics of interest (e.g., forms of harm and reporting processes). However, educational information about equity, diversity, and inclusion and information on how to foster positive environments in sport was lacking. For reporting mechanisms, results showed that each organisation's approach to receiving reports of maltreatment varied, including their ability to directly intake, investigate, and sanction instances of maltreatment. The findings are interpreted and critiqued considering previous literature and recommendations for future research and practice are suggested.","MacPherson, Ellen","Battaglia, Anthony","Faculty of Kinesiology & Physical Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada"

American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation,2022,7,A Conversation Between Past and Present Chairs of the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation: Four Decades of History and the Future of Board Certification.,"On the 75th anniversary of the founding of the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 11 of the surviving chairs of the board convened virtually to reflect on the past 40 years of major trends for the accrediting body of physiatrists. The field rapidly expanded in the 1980s, driven by changes in the reimbursement environment. This rapid expansion drove an improvement in the caliber of residents choosing the field and in the quality of training programs. As physical medicine and rehabilitation evolved from a small- to medium-sized specialty, the board addressed many challenges: securing a credible position within the American Board of Medical Specialties; addressing a rising demand for subspecialty certification; improving training and exposure to physiatry; enhancing the quality of the accreditation process; and reducing the burden of accreditation on diplomates. The future development of physiatry includes improving diversity, equity, and inclusion, while restoring provider morale, well-being, and meaningfulness in work. Although challenges remain, physiatry as a field has grown to be well established through the board's efforts and respected within the larger medical community.","Ditunno, John F.","Cohen, B.

Christian Higher Education,2022,7,Dignity for Whom? How 4-Year Catholic Institutions Display Commitments to Diversity on Institutional Websites.,"This article presents the findings of a content analysis study that examined how Catholic institutional websites displayed commitments to diversity through their publicly available websites. This research project used a conceptual framework exploring the phenomenon of organizational impression management, which is concerned with how institutions shape their image to various audiences. The literature on non-performative diversity language in higher education is reviewed, illustrating how colleges and universities may profess a commitment to diversity in the abstract without engaging in meaningful change. Using a sample of 54 institutions representing 22 of the 25 Catholic congregations (i.e., religious orders), we surveyed their websites to understand how and where they discussed topics of diversity. This process involved examining what specific language each institution used to articulate its commitments (e.g., diversity, equity, inclusion, social justice) and who was associated with diversity work. Findings revealed that a majority of institutional websites included references to diversity-related terms, but failed to define the meaning of the words being used. Additionally, findings indicated that Catholic higher education institutions widely varied in the positioning of diversity-related content on their websites. Suggestions for future research and implications for practice are then offered for religiously affiliated institutions of higher education.","Duran, Antonio","Hooten, Zachary J.","Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, USA"
American Journal of Health Promotion,2022,7,Do Faith Friendly Workplaces Increase Well-Being?,"Many will draw distinctions between finding your purpose and tapping into spirituality. And many more are quick to point out that they are spiritual but not religious. This predictable definitional dynamic makes me doubtful that adoption of purpose finding strategies will be the gateway to unlocking the ambivalence and stigma related to sharing one's faith in company settings. Drawing from tenets that drive social epidemics, wellness professionals and faith leaders travel in 'closed circles' and it will take 'connectors' with ties in both circles to spread the idea that workplace wellness and faith traditions can have positive synergies. Healthy People 2030 defines health and well-being as ""how people think, feel, and function—at a personal and social level—and how they evaluate their lives as a whole.""

World Neurosurgery,2022,7,Trends in Racial and Ethnic Representation Among Neurosurgery Applicants and Residents: A Comparative Analysis of Procedural Specialties.,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion within the healthcare workforce are conducive to providing culturally competent care. However, few existing studies have assessed the level of racial and ethnic diversity among resident physicians and residency applicants. Our objective was to provide a comparative analysis of the trends in racial and ethnic representation within different subspecialties in medicine. Using data from the American Association of Medical Colleges and the Journal of the American Medical Association, we evaluated the racial and ethnic identification of residency applicants and current residents in 9 procedural-focused specialties from 2005 to 2019 and performed a descriptive analysis to compare the different levels of racial and ethnic diversity in these specialties. Among the specialties analyzed during the study period, neurosurgery had the greatest magnitude of differences between Black/African-American residency applicants and current residents. The percentage of Black/African-American applicants was 92% greater than that of Black/African-American residents (10% of applicants vs. 5.2% of residents). In contrast, the percentage of White neurosurgery residents was 17.6% greater than that of White neurosurgery applicants (53.9% of applicants vs. 63.4% of residents). Similar trends were noted in all the specialties evaluated. Obstetrics and gynecology demonstrated the least disparity between Black/African-American applicants and residents (13.7% of applicants vs. 10.2% of residents; 35.4% difference). Hispanic and Asian representation varied widely between specialties. Among the surveyed specialties, neurosurgery demonstrated the greatest disparity between the percentage of Black/African-American residency applicants and current residents. To further drive progress in this domain, we advocate for a series of initiatives designed to increase underrepresented minority participation in neurosurgery practice and scholarship.","Caruso, James P.","Singh, Ravinderjit","Department of Neurosurgery, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas, USA"

Medical Education,2022,6,Applicants' perception of fit to residency programmes in the video‐interview era: A large multidisciplinary survey.,"Introduction: 'Fit' refers to an applicants' perceived compatibility to a residency programme. A variety of structural, identity‐related and relational factors contribute to self‐assessments of fit. The 2021 residency recruitment cycle in the USA was performed virtually due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Little is known about how video‐interviewing may affect residency applicants' ability to gauge fit. Methods: A multidisciplinary, anonymous survey was distributed to applicants at a large academic institution between rank order list (ROL) certification deadline and Match Day 2021. Using Likert‐type scales, applicants rated factors for importance to 'fit' and their ease of assessment through video‐interviewing. Applicants also self‐assigned fit scores to the top‐ranked programme in their ROL using Likert‐type scales with pairs of anchoring statements. Results: Four hundred seventy‐three applicants responded to the survey (25.7% response rate). The three most important factors to applicants for assessment of fit (how much the programme seemed to care, how satisfied residents seem with their programme and how well the residents get along) were also the factors with the greatest discrepancy between importance and ease of assessment through video‐interviewing. Diversity‐related factors were more important to female applicants compared with males and to non‐White applicants compared with White applicants. Furthermore, White male applicants self‐assigned higher fit scores compared with other demographic groups. Conclusion: There is a marked discrepancy between the most important factors to applicants for fit and their ability to assess those factors virtually. Minoritised trainees self‐assigned lower fit scores to their top‐ranked programme, which should raise concern amongst medical educators and highlights the importance of expanding current diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in academic medicine. This paper offers examination of how residency applicants assess fit to the programs at which they interview during the virtual recruitment era, showing that female and minority applicants perceive poorer fit.","Zárate Rodriguez, Jorge G.","Gan, Connie Y.","Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis Missouri,, USA"

These experiences are not unique to any particular institution or university, but rather reflect systemic racism and the upholding of White supremacy in higher education throughout the United States. We highlight the differential vulnerability faced by WOC women in academia, which are often unaddressed in the pursuit of what is seen to be an egalitarian or colorblind merit review. Utilizing autoethnographic techniques and bearing in mind our own positionalities, we share personal narratives regarding our own marginalization within White spaces and the emotional labor that we are often asked to carry for the institutions within which we work. Themes include experiences of tokenization or assumed intellectual inferiority. Given the current sociopolitical moment and the heightened awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within universities, institutions of higher education must move beyond simply hiring more people of color or conducting diversity trainings to ensuring that WOC are more fully included in their roles within universities as faculty, administrators, staff and students.","Azhar, Sameena","McCutcheon, Kendra DeLoach","Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, New York City, USA"

Disaster Prevention & Management,2022,1,"Considerations for creating equitable and inclusive communication campaigns associated with ShakeAlert, the earthquake early warning system for the West Coast of the USA.","Purpose: The 2019 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR) cites earthquakes as the most damaging natural hazard globally, causing billions of dollars of damage and killing thousands of people. Earthquakes have the potential to drastically impact physical, social and economic landscapes; to reduce this risk, earthquake early warning (EEW) systems have been developed. However, these technical EEW systems do not operate in a vacuum; the inequities in social systems, along with the needs of diverse populations, must be considered when developing these systems and their associated communication campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: This article reviews aspects of social vulnerability as they relate to ShakeAlert, the EEW system for the USA. The authors identified two theories (relationship management theory and mute group theory) to inform self-reflective questions for agencies managing campaigns for EEW systems, which can assist in the development of more inclusive communication practices. Finally, the authors suggest this work contributes to important conversations about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) issues within early warning systems and earthquake preparedness campaigns in general. Findings: To increase inclusivity, Macnamara (2012) argues that self-reflective questioning while analyzing perspective, philosophy and approaches for a campaign can help. Specific to EEW campaigns, developers may find self-reflective questions a useful approach to increase inclusion. These questions are guided by two theories and are explored in the paper. Research limitations/implications: Several research limitations exist. First, this work explores two theories to develop a combined theoretical model for self-reflective questions. Further research is required to determine if this approach and the combination of these two theories have adequately informed the development of the reflective questions. Originality/value: The authors could find little peer-reviewed work examining DEI for EEW systems, and ShakeAlert in particular. While articles on early warning systems exist that explore aspects of this, EEW and ShakeAlert, with its very limited time frames for warnings, creates unique challenges.","Jenkins, Mariah R.","McBride, Sara K.","Earthquake Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Moffett Field, California, USA"

American Naturalist,2021,7,"Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior: A Call for Diversity in Our Model Systems and Discipline.","Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are fascinated by life's variation but also seek to understand phenomena and mechanisms that apply broadly across taxa. Model systems can help us extract generalities from amid all the wondrous diversity, but only if we choose and develop them carefully, use them wisely, and have a range of model systems from which to choose. In this introduction to the Special Feature on Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB), we begin by grappling with the question, What is a model system? We then explore where our model systems come from, in terms of the skills and other attributes required to develop them and the historical biases that influence traditional model systems in EEB. We emphasize the importance of communities of scientists in the success of model systems—narrow scientific communities can restrict the model organisms themselves. We also consider how our discipline was built around one type of ""model scientist""—a history still reflected in the field. This lack of diversity in EEB is unjust and also narrows the field's perspective, including by restricting the questions asked and talents used to answer them. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion will require acting at many levels, including structural changes. Diversity in EEB, in both model systems and the scientists who use them, strengthens our discipline.","Duffy, Meghan A.","García-Robledo, Carlos","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109"
Multicultural Perspectives,2020,4,Culturally Responsive Teacher Education for Rural and Native Communities.,"This article explores the marginalized contexts of rural and Native American communities that have made recruitment and retention in teacher education inequitable in remote areas. Through facilitating a Culturally Responsive Pedagogy workshop series with schools in a neighboring rural county, having a large Native population and a very low student academic achievement rate, we discovered strong resistance from local educators to the notion of ""culture"" influencing student achievement. Our disappointment in the outcomes of the workshops caused us to examine the services our university provided to rural and Native place-based pre-service educators. As a result, we created a Satellite program to more responsively meet rural teachers' unique needs and circumstances. By providing greater access to higher education and teacher licensing for students in remote locations, and by embedding equity, diversity, inclusion, and culturally relevant curriculum in all Satellite coursework, we hope to produce teachers who will return to their communities committed to improving schools and promoting equity and social-emotional and academic success for their future students.","Adams, Roni","Farnsworth, Megan",Southern Oregon University

Describe the development of essential competencies for psychologists in pediatric palliative care (PPC) 2. Discuss psychologists' roles in PPC, research, and education and the value of inclusion as members of the multidisciplinary PPC team Psychologists are not yet routinely embedded into pediatric palliative care (PPC) teams, though have been increasingly recognized as contributing unique expertise to the field (eg, evidence-based assessment and treatment of psychological symptoms; research methods, design, and implementation; team- and systems-related skills). Accordingly, national and international organizations have called for inclusion of psychologists and behavioral health specialists within PPC (eg, World Health Organization, 2018; American Psychological Association, 2017; Psycho-Oncology Cooperative Research Group, 2021). Responding to these calls, a workgroup of nine pediatric psychologists (ie, clinicians, researchers, and educators with 4–16 years of experience in PPC) set out to develop competencies for PPC psychologists. Goals were to (1) define the role of psychology in PPC and increase interdisciplinary colleagues' understanding of our expertise, (2) advocate for inclusion of psychologists in PPC teams, and (3) standardize graduate and post-graduate training to ensure a competent workforce. The proposed Podium Presentation will describe the process of developing these competencies, including review of existing competencies in related mental health disciplines and other psychology subspecialties, selection of a competency model, competency draft development, and review by a multidisciplinary and diverse group of stakeholders, all with careful attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical care, research, education, and training. We will introduce the essential competencies in six functional and foundational domains (ie, application, education, systems, science, interpersonal, and professionalism) along with corresponding behavioral anchors, thereby orienting the multidisciplinary audience to the unique contributions of psychologists in PPC. Finally, we will highlight how these competencies can help PPC leaders advocate for inclusion of psychology on PPC teams, recruit qualified psychologists into new roles on those teams, and best utilize the expertise of their psychology team members to promote comprehensive biopsychosocial care of patients and families.","Thompson, Amanda L.","McCarthy, Sarah R.","Life with Cancer, Inova Schar Cancer Institute"

Social Science & Medicine,2022,8,"Strategies of inclusion: The tradeoffs of pursuing ""baked in"" diversity through place-based recruitment.","US funding agencies have begun to institutionalize expectations that biomedical studies achieve defined thresholds for diversity among research participants, including in precision medicine research (PMR). In this paper, we examine how practices of recruitment have unfolded in the wake of these diversity mandates. We find that a very common approach to seeking diverse participants leverages understandings of spatial, geographic, and site diversity as proxies and access points for participant diversity. That is, PMR investigators recruit from a diverse sampling of geographic areas, neighborhoods, sites, and institutional settings as both opportunistic but also meaningful ways to ""bake in"" participant diversity. In this way, logics of geographic and institutional diversity shift the question from who to recruit, to where. However, despite seeing geographic and site diversity as social and scientific 'goods' in the abstract and as key to getting diverse participants, PMR teams told us that working with diverse sites was often difficult in practice due to constraints in funding, time, and personnel, and inadequate research infrastructures and capacity. Thus, the ways in which these geographic and institutional diversity strategies were implemented resulted ultimately in limiting the meaningful inclusion of populations and organizations that had not previously participated in biomedical research and reproduced the inclusion of institutions that are already represented. These prevailing assumptions about and practices of ""baked-in"" diversity in fact exacerbate and produce other forms of inequity, in research capacity and research representation. These findings underscore how structural inequities in research resources must be addressed for diversity to be achieved in both research sites and research participants. • Precision medicine research funding often requires diverse participation. • Precision medicine research often uses geographic and site diversity to recruit. • Strategies used to diversify studies favors better-resourced institutions. • Relying on geographic and site diversity can undermine goals of diversity and equity. • Changes to the ecosystem of and expectations for PMR are needed to advance equity.","Shim, Janet K.","Bentz, Michael","Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, USA"

Proceedings of the Association for Information Science & Technology,2021,10,At the Margins of Epistemology: Amplifying Alternative Ways of Knowing in Library and Information Science.,"This panel argues a paradigm shift is needed in library and information science (LIS) to move the field toward information equity, inclusion, relevance, diversity, and justice. LIS has undermined knowledge systems falling outside of Western traditions. While the foundations of LIS are based on epistemological concerns, the field has neglected to treat people as epistemic agents who are embedded in cultures, social relations and identities, and knowledge systems that inform and shape their interactions with data, information, and knowledge as well as our perceptions of each other as knowers. To achieve this shift we examine epistemicide—the killing, silencing, annihilation, or devaluing of a knowledge system, epistemic injustice and a critique of the user‐centered paradigm. We present alternative epistemologies for LIS: critical consciousness, Black feminism, and design epistemology and discuss these in practice: community generated knowledges as sites of resistance and Indigenous data sovereignty and the ""right to know"".","Patin, Beth","Oliphant, Tami","Syracuse University,, USA"

Considering these barriers, scholars, practitioners, and activists alike have called on institutions of higher education to enhance their capacity to serve, support, and advocate for undocumented students. One way that institutions are responding to this call is by establishing Undocumented Student Resource Centers (USRCs). There is an emerging body of scholarship on the function and importance of USRCs on college campuses in the United States. Yet, there remains a dearth in the literature on the experiences of the higher education professionals committed to coordinating or directing these identity-based centers. This exploratory qualitative study relies on the voices and stories of USRC professionals to understand their self-described roles and responsibilities as well as what keeps them motivated to continue serving, supporting, and advocating for undocumented students.","Tapia-Fuselier, Nicholas",,"Department of Leadership, Research, and Foundations, University of Colorado Colorado Springs"
Bulletin of Volcanology,2022,5,Volcanologists—who are we and where are we going?,"Equity, diversity and inclusivity (EDI) are principles all scientific groups and organisations should strive to achieve as they secure working conditions, policies and practices that not only promote high-quality scientific output but also well-being in their communities. In this article, we reflect on the progress of EDI in volcanology by presenting data related to memberships of international volcanology organisations, positions on volcanology committees, volcanology awards and lead-authorship on volcanology papers. The sparse demographic data available means our analysis focuses mainly on gender identity discrimination, but we show that discrimination related to ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, physical ability and socio-economic background is also occurring, with the intersection of these discriminations further exacerbating marginalisation within the volcanology community. We share suggestions and recommendations from other disciplines on how individuals, research groups and organisations can promote, develop and implement new initiatives to call out and tackle discrimination and advance EDI in the volcanological community. There is a lot of potential for improvement if we all see our role in creating a more equitable, diverse and inclusive volcanology community. This requires (1) awareness: acknowledgement of the problem, (2) commitment: through the statement of EDI core values and the development of action plans, codes of conducts and guidelines, (3) action: aiming for representation of all groups, and (4) reflection: development through critical self-reflection and a willingness to address shortcomings.","Kavanagh, Janine L.","Annen, Catherine J.","School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool, L69 3GP, Liverpool, UK"
Oncology Nursing Forum,2022,3,RACIAL DIVERSITY WITHIN ONCOLOGY HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP INCREASES POSITIVE OUTCOMES.,"There is currently a large disparity between oncology healthcare leadership that identify as people of color and those who that identify as white. It is well established that having a racially and ethnically diverse healthcare staff improves patient care. One of the major objectives in oncology nursing is diversity, equity and inclusion in clinical practice but often excludes diversity, equity and inclusion in leadership itself. Diversifying leadership could have significant impacts for both patient care and organizational health. This conceptual study aims to determine if having racially and ethnically diverse leadership in oncology healthcare organizations leads to positive outcomes and increasing organizational health. In this context, racially and ethnically diverse refers to individuals who identify as people of color or nonwhite individuals. A literature review was completed to identify themes and common outcomes from different healthcare models in relation to leadership by itself and diverse leadership. In addition, racial and ethnic healthcare disparities were reviewed to determine the types of positive outcomes desired. A conceptual process was used to create guidelines that would support racial diversity in leadership leading to positive outcomes. The results showed that having ethnically and racially diverse leadership in healthcare did improve patient care, quality of life, improved patient outcomes with fewer adverse events, improved employee satisfaction, retention, increased financial reimbursement, and designation as preferred healthcare providers. It also determined that diversity alone will not increase positive outcomes. There must be strong leadership skills as well as a unified vision for the diversity to be successful in improving outcomes. Changing the paradigm of how we envision diversity interventions was equally important as how they were implemented. Increasing the diversity in oncology healthcare leadership is successful at improving the sustainability and profitably of healthcare organizations and enriching the health and wellness of communities in which they serve. Oncology nursing needs diversity to flourish in all areas of practice. Assessing the needs of oncology diversity, equity and inclusion interventions rarely looks at the diversity of leadership making those decisions. If the decisions are not made by diverse leadership, then critical needs may be overlooked. By looking through the lens of diverse leadership we open up a new area for opportunities for inclusive oncology nursing practice.","Salleroli, Alienne",,"Yale New Haven Hospital-Smilow Cancer Center, New Haven, CT"
Condor: Ornithological Applications,2021,5,Juggling parenthood and ornithology: A full lifecycle approach to supporting mothers through the American Ornithological Society.,"The understanding that motherhood impacts career paths is so pervasive among early-career scientists that some feel they must choose parenthood or a career. The penalties associated with motherhood can contribute to the ""leaky pipeline,"" which equates to the high attrition rate of women due to social, economical, or temporal factors as they proceed through their career and exacerbates persistent gender gaps at mid- and late-career stages. Here, we review the literature and summarize common challenges faced by ornithologist mothers and nonbinary parents, and we adopt a full lifecycle approach to recommend evidence-based strategies for overcoming those challenges. The American Ornithological Society (AOS) is well positioned to support and celebrate women and nonbinary ornithologists who choose parenthood, and we highlight progress made by the AOS to improve gender diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Society. For example, AOS caregiver grants allow more parents to attend and participate in conferences. We suggest additional initiatives (e.g., elevating role models, hosting mentoring networks, and disseminating best practices) that could further support women who want to become or already are parents while also achieving rewarding careers in ornithology. AOS leadership can take steps to close the gender gap in ornithology and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. With a larger, more diverse, and talented community, the Society will be better equipped to achieve its mission: conserving and understanding bird life on earth, enriching ornithology as a profession, and mentoring young professionals. LAY SUMMARY Mothers and nonbinary parents face unique challenges for remaining in ornithology, leading to a ""leaky pipeline."" The American Ornithological Society's (AOS) continued support for parents aims to close the gender gap in early-, mid-, and late-career stages. We describe how a full lifecycle approach to advancing diversity and equity can enrich the field of ornithology.

What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: People within the LGBT communities have identified that their experiences of mental health services reinforce stigma and lack an understanding of their specific needs.Their needs can be addressed by mental health services that challenge heteronormative assumptions and promote self‐acceptance and equity. What are the implications for practice?: The existing heteronormative culture in mental health nursing practice needs to be challenged.Practice needs to demonstrate self-awareness of personal and societal LGBT biases, prejudices, and stigma.Practice needs to demonstrate knowledge of important LGBT health care and psychosocial issues.Practice needs to reflect LGBT clinical skills grounded in professional ethics, guidelines, and standards of care. Introduction: The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities are a minority population that experience a range of health disparities, including mental health. Because these groups have higher rates of mental disorder than the general population it is, therefore, pertinent to identify their specific mental health needs and their experiences when accessing mental health care. Aim: To identify the mental health needs of the LGBT communities and their experiences of accessing mental health care. Methods: An integrative review of qualitative studies was conducted. Results: A total of fourteen studies were selected for this review. The studies identified that participants' experiences of accessing mental health care were related to (a) experiencing stigma and (b) staff's lack of knowledge and understanding of LGBT people's needs. They identified a need for mental health care that promotes the principles of equity, inclusion and respect for diversity. Discussion: The LGBT communities while not a homogenous group, face unique challenges when dealing with their mental health needs. Services that promote health equity and self‐acceptance are important for this group. Implications for practice: It is vital that mental health nursing education incorporate models that promote equity, inclusion and respect for diversity regarding this group of people.","Rees, Samuel N.","Crowe, Marie","Centre for Postgraduate Nursing Studies, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand"

The AGSL's collections have a long history that is the product of colonialism, patriarchy, racism, and other issues. The class visits to the AGSL are an excellent opportunity to highlight the collection and to teach students to think critically about primary source materials. In line with the values of the AGSL staff and the UWM Library's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, staff decided it was time to reframe the way the AGSL approaches information literacy instruction. The Public Services Librarian developed a primary source literacy and cartographic literacy program where students begin to teach themselves through the use of guided questionnaires and group discussions prompting the students to think critically about cartographic resources.

The partners have successfully deployed the Collaborative Programming Lifecycle to develop internationally acclaimed EDIA programs in multiple formats that influence local efforts to advance social equity and anti-racism. The joint mission of this partnership is to provide meaningful conversation that strengthens the collective community. While this partnership pre-dates both the pandemic and the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the agencies rapidly transitioned to virtual programming and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to immediate local impact, the partnership's programs have resulted in a compelling new model for making local programs accessible to larger communities at state, regional, and national levels.","Brown, Nicholas A.","Hanington, Kyla","Chief Operating Officer for Communication and Outreach, Prince George's County Memorial Library System, Largo, Maryland, USA"

Collaborative Librarianship,2022,1,Amplifying Antiracism Resources through Intra-University Collaboration.,"In the summer of 2020, The Ohio State University Libraries was asked by The Ohio State University Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) to collaborate with them to provide expanded access to antiracism book content in support of continuing education, reading groups, and professional development across the university. The Libraries' African American and African Studies Librarian worked with ODI's Director for Strategic Diversity Planning, Training, and Assessment to identify antiracism book titles of interest to recommend to the Collections Strategist for purchase or expanded access. The African American and African Studies Librarian created research guides to supplement the reading lists, expanded them to support campus-wide antiracism educational opportunities, and iterated the collection practices. This paper details not only the process of collaboration with another unit within the university, but also outlines challenges and opportunities faced with budget management, publishing and vendor practices with antiracism resources, and COVID-19 implications. It also addresses critical approaches to antiracism within library collaborations to university campus communities, including outreach, teaching, and collections as part of the evolving Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access (DEIA) movement.","Hendricks, Leta","Springs, Gene R.","African American Studies and Human Sciences Librarian, The Ohio State University"

Journal of School Psychology,2021,12,Single-case design standards: An update and proposed upgrades.,"In this paper, we provide a critique focused on the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Standards for Single-Case Research Design (Standards 4.1). Specifically, we (a) recommend the use of visual-analysis to verify a single-case intervention study's design standards and to examine the study's operational issues, (b) identify limitations of the design-comparable effect-size measure and discuss related statistical matters, (c) review the applicability and practicality of Standards 4.1 to single-case designs (SCDs), and (d) recommend inclusion of content pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion in future standards. Within the historical context of the WWC Pilot Standards for Single-Case Design (1.0) , we suggest that Standards 4.1 may best serve as standards for meta-analyses of SCDs but will need to make clear distinctions among the various types of SCD studies that are included in any research synthesis. In this regard, we argue for transparency in SCD studies that meet design standards and those that do not meet design standards in any meta-analysis emanating from the WWC. The intent of these recommendations is to advance the science of SCD research both in research synthesis and in promoting evidence-based practices.","Kratochwill, Thomas R.","Horner, Robert H.","University of Wisconsin, Madison, United States of America"

The article begins with the position that gender equity in academia in Aotearoa New Zealand and beyond is well known yet little engaged with. The recent Sector Reference Group (SRG) set up to engage with the TEC and the academic community about the PBRF Quality Evaluation 2025 has articulated the most progressive agenda yet for women and Māori and Pacific scholars specifically. The article takes a forensic approach, inspired by Sara Ahmed, to follow gender around in the discursive environment within which the PBRF is placed. The article first provides a brief contextual setting for gender representation in the university. The article then explores the sustained critique of the PBRF, paying particular attention to the work of Brower and James (2019) and Walker et al. (2020) and their examination of the gender disparities evident in academia. The article continues by exploring recent SRG reports of the PBRF and the subsequently announced changes to the PBRF. It is argued that these changes move to realign the PBRF so that it accommodates a series of demands made of it in recent years that coalesce around a thicker social justice agenda. Finally, the extent to which women's inequality in academia will ever be a significant issue, despite the changes to the PBRF, that drives equity change is questioned.","Locke, Kirsten","Bensky, Lydia","University of Auckland Auckland, New Zealand"

Religions,2022,5,"Religion, Animals, and Contemplation †.","Animals teach each other. For humans open to trans-species and inter-species dialogue and interaction, animal-others offer important insights into, invocations of and models for diverse and alternative modes of perceiving, experiencing, relating, and being. They in turn challenge anthropocentric conceptions of consciousness and offer glimpses of and perhaps inspiration for increased awareness and presence. Might the current academic vogue of ""equity, diversity, and inclusion"" (EDI; or whichever order you prefer) even extend to ""non-human"" animals? Might this also represent one essential key to the human aspiration for freedom, wellness, and justice? The present article explores the topic of ""religion and animals"" through the complementary dimension of ""contemplation"". Developing a fusion of Animal Studies, Contemplative Studies, Daoist Studies, and Religious Studies, I explore the topic with particular consideration of the indigenous Chinese religion of Daoism with a comparative and cross-cultural sensibility. I draw specific attention to the varieties of Daoist animal engagement, including animal companionship and becoming/being animal. Theologically speaking, this involves recognition of the reality of the Dao (sacred) manifesting through each and every being, and the possibility of inter/trans-species communication, relationality, and even identification. In the process, I suggest that ""animal contemplation"", a form of contemplative practice and contemplative experience that places ""the animal question"" at the center and explores the possibility (actuality) of ""shared animality"", not only offers important opportunities for becoming fully human (animal), but also represents one viable contribution to resolving impending (ongoing) ecological collapse, or at least the all-too-real possibility of a world without butterflies, bees, and birdsong.","Komjathy, Louis",,"Independent Researcher, Highland Park, IL 60035, USA"

"Journal of Leadership, Accountability & Ethics",2022,5,Impact of Diversity Climate on Leadership Effectiveness in Higher Education.,"Prior research has documented that diversity climate positively influences individual and organizational outcomes. However, there is void in current literature on how gender diversity influences subordinates' perception of a leader's effectiveness. In this paper, the researchers investigated how diversity climate affects the relationship between gender of leader and subordinate perceptions of a leader's effectiveness. To investigate this problem, a convenience sampling method was used to select a gender-diverse faculty members sample at a research university in the southern region of the United States. The researchers analyzed the data using exploratory factor analysis to tease out significant factors that underlie structure of the diversity climate and perceptions of a leaders' effectiveness scales. The data shows that diversity climate correlates with faculty's gender and perceptions of leadership effectiveness. That finding also revealed that diversity climate does affect individual, unit, and/or organizational outcomes. The researchers recommended that additional studies be conducted to further examine diversity climate impact on leadership effectiveness and organizational outcomes as organizations embrace diversity, inclusion and equity.","Norze, Jeantyl","Alfaro, Adriana",University of Connecticut
Urology,2022,4,Solutions: Bridging the Diversity Gap in Urology Trainees.,"<bold>Objective: </bold>To address healthcare inequities, diversifying the physician workforce is an important step, and improved efforts to recruit Underrepresented in Medicine (URiM) students is vital. We aim to examine the current state of minority recruitment and provide solutions to increase diversity in urology residency training.<bold>Methods: </bold>We conducted a retrospective analysis of self-reported race and ethnicity data for active urology trainees using the Data Resource Book by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education from 2011 to 2020. We also performed a longitudinal analysis comparing the number of urology applicants to urology trainees from 2016 to 2020 using the Electronic Residency Application Service statistics database. URiMs were designated in alignment with ACGME definitions. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and compared using chi-squared test between race and ethnicity.<bold>Results: </bold>We identified 11,458 active urology trainees for analysis. Of these, 6638 (57.9%) identified as White, 1690 (14.7%) as Asian/Pacific Islander, 442 (3.9%) as Hispanic, 380 (3.3%) as Black, 11 (0.1%) as Native American, 608 (5.3%) as other race/ethnicity, and 1689 (14.7%) as unknown race or ethnicity.

Evidence-Based Practice in Child & Adolescent Mental Health,2022,4,Equity in Mental Health Services for Youth at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis: Considering Marginalized Identities and Stressors.,"Prevention and early intervention programs have been initiated worldwide to serve youth at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P), who are adolescents and young adults experiencing subclinical psychosis and functional impairment. The primary goals of these efforts are to prevent or mitigate the onset of clinical psychosis, while also treating comorbid issues. It is important to consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in CHR-P work, especially as these programs continue to proliferate around the world. Further, there is a long history in psychiatry of misdiagnosing and mistreating psychosis in individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Although there have been significant developments in early intervention psychosis work, there is evidence that marginalized groups are underserved by current CHR-P screening and intervention efforts. These issues are compounded by the contexts of continued social marginalization and significant mental health disparities in general child/adolescent services. Within this narrative review and call to action, we use an intersectional and minority stress lens to review and discuss current issues related to equity in CHR-P services, offer evidence-based recommendations, and propose next steps. In particular, our intersectional and minority stress lenses incorporate perspectives for a range of marginalized and underserved identities related to race, ethnicity, and culture; faith; immigration status; geography/residence; gender identity; sexual orientation; socioeconomic status/class; and ability status.","DeLuca, Joseph S.","Novacek, Derek M.","Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"
Earth & Space Science,2022,4,"Hydrological Perspectives on Integrated, Coordinated, Open, Networked (ICON) Science.","Hydrologic sciences depend on data monitoring, analyses, and simulations of hydrologic processes to ensure safe, sufficient, and equal water distribution. These hydrologic data come from but are not limited to primary (lab, plot, and field experiments) and secondary sources (remote sensing, UAVs, hydrologic models) that typically follow FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable: (go-fair.org)). Easy availability of FAIR data has become possible because the hydrology‐oriented organizations have pushed the community to increase coordination of the protocols for generating data and sharing model platforms. In addition, networking at all levels has emerged with an invigorated effort to activate community science efforts that complement conventional data collection methods. However, it has become difficult to decipher various complex hydrologic processes with increasing data. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, provide more accurate and faster alternatives to better understand different hydrological processes. The Integrated, Coordinated, Open, Networked (ICON) framework provides a pathway for water users to include and respect diversity, equity, and inclusivity. In addition, ICONs support the integration of peoples with historically marginalized identities into this professional discipline of water sciences. This article comprises three independent commentaries about the state of ICON principles in hydrology and discusses the opportunities and challenges of adopting them. Plain Language Summary: The Integrated, Coordinated, Open, Networked (ICON) perspective in the discipline of hydrological sciences helps integrate remote sensing, numerical modeling, data science, and different digital concepts, including machine learning to understand simple to complex hydrological processes at diverse temporal and spatial scales. Other benefits of incorporating the ICON framework include but are not limited to open, shareable, and easy to interpret, accurate, and timely generated monitored/observed or/and simulated water sciences information. Moreover, participation of the community and stakeholders help establish a network where research, education, and collaboration become easy and accessible. Besides, the ICON framework promotes innovation, equality, diversity, inclusion, and open access research in the discipline of hydrology that involves and supports early career, marginalized racial groups, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+), and/or disabled researchers.

Advances in Pulmonary Hypertension,2022,4,What Rare Disease Patient Advocacy Groups Are Doing to Mitigate the Effects of Disparities.,"Compared with chronic diseases affecting larger populations, rare disease (RD) patients experience great inequities in diagnosis, care, and research. Within RDs, health disparities compound these inequities, as marginalized communities experience additional barriers in accessing clinical care and are often underrepresented from participation in research and clinical trials. For almost 40 years, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), a RD umbrella organization with over 300 nonprofit organizational members, has led efforts to understand and address inequities for the RD community through innovative research, programming, and collaboration with patients, caregivers, practitioners, and external stakeholders. The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 brought to light longstanding disparities and discrimination for marginalized communities as well as pivotal racial justice movements. These events spurred many RD nonprofit organizations' interest in increasing outreach and engagement with minoritized communities within RDs and diversifying their organization internally. Building on the increased interest in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), NORD has focused on collecting case studies from within NORD and its member organizations to capture current efforts to improve DEI within the RD ecosystem. One way clinicians can work to mitigate the effects of disparities is to collaborate with RD patient organizations; this article provides a means by which clinicians and researchers can understand some of the challenges RD nonprofit organizations face in bridging disparities and learn about solutions to supporting marginalized patients within their communities. Clinicians are encouraged to join NORD in our policy efforts advocating to ensure patient access to health care providers practicing in a different state vis-à-vis telehealth.","Drell, Debbie","De Silva, Ashanthi",

Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,2022,3,Cultivating diversity in the advanced practice registered nurse workforce: An exemplar from an advanced practice registered nurse fellowship program.,"Diversity in the nursing workforce is an important driver of patient satisfaction, adherence to care, and quality outcomes. Systemic barriers exist that prevent individuals from underrepresented minority groups entering and advancing in the nursing workforce. To advance the health of the community we serve and with grant support from the Health Resources and Services Administration, we developed a postgraduate advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) fellowship in community health. This program is a partnership between a federally qualified health center and a college of nursing. We developed a deliberate plan to recruit and admit diverse applicants who would continue to practice in our community at the conclusion of their fellowship year. Using targeted recruitment outreach, we identified new-graduate APRNs who were representative of the community we serve. Using holistic review methodology, we interviewed applicants with explicit efforts to mitigate the effects of bias towards race, ethnicity, gender, and academic affiliation. We embraced a quality-improvement ethos that enabled evolution and growth with each iteration of the program. Understanding that intention does not translate to outcomes, we undertook ongoing critique of our methods and engaged diverse resources to improve our processes. Over two admission cycles, our fellowship in community health for new graduate APRNs has demonstrated improvements in strategies to diversify the community health workforce. We will describe our process of nonjudgmental self-critique and a quality-improvement framework that can serve as a strategy to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the community health workforce.","Raghu, Natalie DNP","McNamara, Mary DNP",
Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,2022,3,Characteristics of and comparisons between US fourth-year veterinary students graduating with and without educational debt from 2001 through 2020.,"OBJECTIVE To characterize and compare fourth-year students of US veterinary schools graduating with and without related educational debt (ie, DVM debt) from 2001 through 2020. SAMPLE45,756 fourth-year veterinary students who participated in the annual AVMA Senior Survey from 2001through 2020. PROCEDURESSurvey data were summarized for variables hypothesized to be associated with DVM debt. Multivariable modeling was used to investigate associations between these variables and the likelihood of graduating with DVM debt. RESULTS Mean DVM debt increased fairly steadily from $56,824 in 2001 (n = 1,587) to $157,146 in 2020 (2,859). Of 45,756 students, 6,129 (13.4%) had no DVM debt. Attending Tuskegee University and having children (both men and women) were associated with an increased likelihood of DVM debt. Attending certain other veterinary schools and more recent survey year were associated with a decreased likelihood. For 2020, the likelihood of DVM debt decreased with increasing percentage of tuition paid by family and increased with increasing percentage of tuition paid by educational loans, being a woman with children, and increasing total cost of attendance. No association was found with state cost of living index or per capita income. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested a growing rift between US veterinary students who cannot afford tuition and fees without accumulating financially concerning levels of debt and those who have the financial ability or family situation to fully fund veterinary school. Efforts should be undertaken to recruit across socioeconomic statuses and provide meaningful scholarships to students with greatest financial needs to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in veterinary medicine.","Bain, Bridgette","Lefebvre, Sandra L.","Veterinary Economics Division, AVMA, Schaumburg, IL"

International Journal of Integrated Care (IJIC),2022,4,"A Co-design Approach for System Transformation in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.","Introduction: The Western Ontario Health Team (WOHT) is a newly formed entity aiming to support the primary and secondary healthcare needs of a population of over 514,000 in London-Middlesex, Ontario, Canada. Our first year priority population are adults with a primary diagnosis of advanced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and/or Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in need of systemlevel care coordination or navigation, with special emphasis on patients who are at risk of institutionalization. Experience-based co-design and meaningful patient/client and caregiver engagement (guided by a Patient/Client & Care Partner Council) are embedded into all WOHT activities. Aims Objectives Theory or Methods: Through relationships with local patients/clients, caregiver partners, providers, and health system administrators, the co-design process is being used to collectively develop system improvement strategies. Co-design begins with recruiting a network of system stakeholders (i.e., patients/clients, caregivers, providers, system administrators), guided by an equity, diversity, and inclusion matrix to ensure representation aligning with the demographics of our local population. Discovery interviews are conducted with a subset of this network (n=40) to understand current health system experiences and opportunities for change. Findings from discovery interviews then inform broader co-design sessions with diverse stakeholder groups to co-define problems and codevelop solutions. Highlights or Results or Key Findings: Highlights and outputs of this process will include a summary of discovery interviews describing current experiences with regional COPD and CHF care, a set of co-defined problem statements with associated co-created solutions, and an implementation plan which the WOHT will implement through a plan, do, study, act (PDSA) approach. Priorities for co-creation include, but are not limited to, ensuring patients have access to a sustained care relationship, informing the development of a shared care record, and laying the infrastructure for patient individualized care plans. The co-design methodology and supporting materials including recruitment frameworks, co-design session planning guides, engagement matrices, and workplans will also be refined through this process and published. Conclusions: The WOHT embraces principles of co-design in all aspects of its system transformation agenda. This approach empowers patients/clients, care partners, providers, and administrators to drive health system change towards better outcomes. Lessons learned and materials developed through this process will inform other organizations in similar transformation activities. Implications for applicability/transferability sustainability and limitations: The co-design approach being used by the WOHT in its system transformation efforts will be scaled and repeated in additional populations. Lessons learned from this first co-design plan will be incorporated into future iterations. This approach can also be used by other regions for large-scale system planning and design purposes.","Elliott, Jacobi","Smith, Alexander","St. Joseph's Health Care London & Lawson Health Research Institute, Canada"
Oncology Nursing Forum,2022,3,ONCOLOGY NURSING RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOCUSED ON STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HEALTH EQUITY.,"The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) recognized a need to reaffirm its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. ONS commissioned nurse scientists and experts in equity to update the ONS 2019-2022 research priorities to expand foci addressing structural racism and health inequities in oncology nursing. Disparities persist in cancer screening, incidence, treatment, mortality, and quality of life outcomes between Black and White patients, despite efforts to provide culturally responsive care to all patients. A new approach of examining how oncology nurse scientists can intervene on structural racism to achieve equitable health outcomes for patients is needed. Guided by critical race theory, an ONS appointed rapid response research team discussed the pervasiveness of racism and how it operates in oncology nursing. Personal race consciousness and experiences as people of color and, or individuals working for equity were shared. These conversations were guided by emergent findings from a rapid literature review focused on synthesizing the state of the science on oncology nursing and cancer health disparities. The team generated and disseminated a list of potential research priorities through an ONS nurse researcher database to obtain input via electronic survey. Survey findings were applied to generate key priority research areas and recommendations related to each area. Three key research priority areas were identified including the design and testing of interventions that (1) build trust in cancer research (2) focus on the social determinants of health and (3) use community-based approaches. Several recommendations related to each area will be presented. Application of these research priorities and specific recommendations provide a blueprint for oncology nurse scientists, clinicians, and organizations to intervene on racism and improve health equity for all patients. The rapid response approach was employed by this expert panel and provides a model for organizations to respond to urgent concerns that arise in oncology nursing science and practice. This team was appointed to build upon the 2019-2022 research priorities and expand the priorities related to racial and ethnic diversity in research, studying the social determinants of health, and interventions focused on modifiable behaviors. A second phase of this work focused on recommendations to achieve equity in the oncology nursing workforce and health care.","Jones, Randy","Hirschey, Rachel","University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA"

AEM Education & Training,2021,9,Teaching emergency medicine residents health equity through simulation immersion.,"Objective: Our aim was to conduct a large, case‐based diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) simulation exercise with a goal to improve the DEI pillars of cultural and structural awareness for residents. Methods: Utilizing data resulting in poor health outcomes, the top eight themes were utilized, and via a modified Delphi approach, a diverse group of faculty developed representative cases. A mass simulation effort was organized with the assistance of our local simulation office. Twenty residents in groups of two to three rotated through all scenarios. Each resident group was allotted 15 min for each scenario. After each case, resident teams received feedback from standardized patients and a debrief together with the simulation directors. Pre‐ and postsimulation surveys were developed and distributed to residents. Results: Twenty residents completed the simulation. Eighteen completed a pre‐ and postsimulation survey. Every resident rated the overall usefulness of this activity as a 5.0 on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest score. All cases demonstrated an improvement in the residents perceived confidence on a 9‐point Likert scale. All residents reported improved understanding of key concepts in health care disparities as related to race/ethnicity, homelessness, LGBTQIA, and their own biases. The largest improvement was seen in the overarching theme of ""difficult conversations"" with a presimulation survey mean of 3.9 and postsimulation survey mean of 6.5 (delta = +2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.9 to 3.3, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Emergency medicine residency programs must fulfill their obligation to DEI efforts and national requirements while ensuring competency clinically. Mass simulation exercises are a way to incorporate this training. This preliminary data shows promise for a solution and can be easily duplicated. Diversity, health equity, inclusivity, and cultural humility can be effectively taught by an innovative mass simulation effort.","Ward‐Gaines, Jacqueline","Buchanan, Jennie A.","Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora Colorado,, USA"
Research Papers in Education,2020,12,"Gender, ethnicity and career progression in UK higher education: a case study analysis.","This article uses case study interviews to examine women's experiences in higher education. It focuses on career progression, support available for promotion and particular initiatives for staff retention. The findings suggest that whilst some progress has been made to support White and Black and minority ethnic women in their career trajectories, greater change is needed in order that inclusion is embedded within institutional frameworks and strategic plans. Furthermore, clearer evidence is needed by universities to demonstrate how they are meeting their legal equality requirements as specified by the Equality Act (2010). The mere presence of diversity and equality policies does not necessarily demonstrate that gender and ethnic inequalities are being addressed. Such policies may simply result in a 'tick box' exercise. In order to address such inequalities, issues of diversity and equality must be embedded within the cultural organisation of institutions which are identified in key objectives resulting in real outcomes and practice. Additionally, there is a need to consider intersectional identities and the impact of ethnicity on women's experiences in higher education.","Bhopal, Kalwant",,"School of Education, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"

Molecular Imaging & Biology,2021,6,Visions by Women in Molecular Imaging Network: Antiracism and Allyship in Action.,"Recent events in America in 2020 have stimulated a worldwide movement to dismantle anti-Black racism in all facets of our lives. Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a ""term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically."" In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined ""Visions"" (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals. We would like to specifically acknowledge the Black women who took the time to be interviewed, write perspectives, and share their lived experiences in hopes that it will inspire genuine and lasting change.","Akam, Eman","Azevedo, Carmen","Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"

Interdisciplinary Science Reviews,2019,6,Creating a more supportive and inclusive university culture: a mixed-methods interdisciplinary comparative analysis of medical and social sciences at the University of Oxford.,"Results of two C-Change surveys of 4997 faculty and staff in medical and social sciences are analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and presented with illustrative quotations giving voice to critical personal perceptions of the culture and efforts to improve it. The C-Change survey included 12 dimensions of the culture: Vitality; Self-Efficacy in Career Advancement; Institutional Support; Relationships/Inclusion/Trust; Values Alignment; Ethical/Moral Distress; Leadership Aspirations; Work-Life Integration; Gender Equity; Black and Minority Ethnic Equity; Institutional Change Efforts for Diversity; Institutional Change Efforts for Faculty Support. Women were less positive than men on six dimensions in medical and ten dimensions in social sciences, suggesting that women's experiences are different to those of men. Both women and men were more positive about the culture in medical than social sciences. A more positive culture in medical sciences is attributed to the wide-spread implementation of Athena SWAN gender equality action plans linked to the NIHR funding incentives.","Ovseiko, Pavel V.","Pololi, Linda H.","Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2023,5,AllyTalk: Applying Principles of Advanced Communication for Upstander Training (TH115C).,"1. Utilize The 4 Ds framework for addressing microaggressions. 2. Express increased confidence and likelihood of interrupting microaggressions. VitalTalk is an evidence-based approach to teaching advanced communication skills for serious illness. The methodology has been adapted for many different learners and challenging conversation topics. The ""AllyTalk"" training applies the VitalTalk process to teaching communication skills for interrupting microaggressions. The goal of the AllyTalk pilot training is to increase confidence and likelihood of interrupting microaggressions. AllyTalk is an hour-long training session. The training was piloted at a large, academic medical center with palliative care interdisciplinary team; school of medicine stakeholders; and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) experts. Participants played a game using cards with examples of The 4 Ds (direct, distract, delegate, debrief) framework for interrupting microaggressions with specific phrases to respond to examples of microaggressions. Participants then took part in rapid-fire roleplay scenarios with the opportunity to try different phrases and ""pause"" as needed to try new communication skills. Thirty-one people participated in the initial pilot training: 83% female; 21% identified as Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/African American, or Hispanic/Latinx. Participants completed three surveys: pre-training, immediate post-training, and a 4-month follow-up regarding confidence and likelihood of interrupting microaggressions using a 4-point Likert scale. Participants reporting ratings of ""somewhat"" and ""very"" in confidence and likelihood to intervene in microaggressions increased from 32% to 86% and 61% to 86% respectively. At the 4-month follow-up, increases in confidence and likelihood to intervene were sustained (83% and 83%). Limitations include low response rate to the 4-month follow-up survey (58%). The AllyTalk pilot demonstrates that the VitalTalk methodology can be adapted to teaching skills for interrupting microaggressions. This intervention resulted in sustained increases in confidence and likelihood of disrupting microaggressions. The next step for this training is to disseminate it in different specialty departments across a large, academic medical center campus.","Arnett, Kelly","Navarro-Leahy, Ann",University of Colorado

Male allyship toward women can be a useful expression of men's positive/caring masculinity, but little empirical research has examined if and how male allyship benefits men and women psychologically and socially. Using women's other- and self-reports and men's self-reports from 101 male-female colleague dyads in male-dominated departments, we tested a model involving men's allyship, women's inclusion and vitality, and men's growth and work-family enrichment. As hypothesized, men's growth mediated the link between their allyship and work-family enrichment, and women's perceptions of men's allyship predicted women's vitality, both directly and through inclusion. However, men's allyship was weakly associated with women's perceptions of their allyship, and men's benefits were unrelated to women's inclusion or vitality. Findings highlight the importance of male allyship rooted in positive masculinity while underscoring a disconnect between women's and men's experiences. The implications for promoting gender inclusion and diversity in male-dominated departments of higher education are discussed.","Warren, Meg A.","Bordoloi, Samit D.",

An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.","Coates, Wendy C.","Yarris, Lalena M.","University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine, Harbor–UCLA Department of Emergency Medicine, Los Angeles California,, USA"

Multicultural Perspectives,2020,7,Reflection: Harnessing Energy of Social Movements for Lasting Change.,"We are witnessing a change in the social consciousness of people across the globe as they are rising up in protest against inequities, injustice, systemic racism, anti-Black racism, and other forms of oppression. Thousands of people are infected and dying from the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) disproportionately and has laid bare the structural inequities in healthcare and other aspects of society. The killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by the police has sparked not only national outcry in the U.S. and across the globe against anti-Black racism and other forms of injustice, but also conversations on systemic racism and white supremacy and their manifestations in policies and the daily lives of BIPOC. In this article I examine the role the protests and social movements for racial and economic justice can play in achieving lasting change in dismantling system racism, white supremacy, and the structures and policies that uphold it. I urge educators and organizations such as the National Association for Multicultural Education to harness the energy of the moment to call for changes in education and schooling grounded in decolonizing theory and practice. I end by calling for a rethinking and reimaging of diversity, equity, inclusion, social justice, and multicultural discourses, which some have argued, given the ongoing presence and impact of white supremacy and systemic racism in all facets of society including education, have not achieved the intended goals and in some instances have been coopted by those advancing neoliberal and neocolonial agendas.","Lopez, Ann E.",,"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto"

Language,2020,12,Enabling excellence and racial justice in universities by addressing structural obstacles to work by and with people from racially minoritized communities: Response to Charity Hudley et al.,"This response builds upon ideas introduced in Charity Hudley et al.'s (2020) target article by focusing on the themes of excellence and racial justice. In addition to relying on previous academic work on race and racism, I also draw from my own experiences as a person of color in the field of linguistics and as a scholar who works with racially minoritized communities. The primary claims of this paper are that the field of linguistics as a whole benefits from broadening and deepening our conceptualizations of scholarly excellence and from consciously attending to the needs and concerns of scholars and community members from racially minoritized groups. To support these claims, I discuss ways in which institutional structures of universities hinder equity and inclusion by marginalizing contributions of scholars from racially minoritized groups and by promoting extractive and neocolonial work involving minoritized communities. I conclude by offering general principles that can serve as guides for fostering greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in university settings. These principles involve acknowledging present shortcomings, aligning the reward system to a broadened notion of excellence and to inclusion, and embracing creative alternatives.","MONTOYA, IGNACIO L.",,"University of Nevada, Reno"
American Journal of Human Biology,2022,2,Demystifying mentorship: Tips for successfully navigating the mentor–mentee journey.,"Background: Quality mentorship is crucial for long‐term success in academia and overall job satisfaction. Unfortunately, formal mentorship training is lacking, and there is little recourse for failed mentor–mentee relationships. Methods: We performed a literature review to understand the current state of mentorship research with a focus on: (1) what mentorship is and why it is important for success; (2) establishing mentor‐mentee relationships; and (3) the role of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Results: From the literature review, we compiled a number of mentorship recommendations for individuals, departments, institutions, and professional associations. These recommendations focus on building a mentorship network, establishing formalized mentorship training, how to build a productive and mutually beneficial mentor–mentee relationship, and instituting a system of mentorship accountability. Conclusion: We hope that by centralizing this information and providing a list of resources and actionable recommendations we inspire and encourage others to make meaningful changes in their approach to mentorship to create a more kind, caring, and equitable environment in which to conduct our work.","Ocobock, Cara","Niclou, Alexandra","Department of Anthropology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame Indiana,, USA"

Journal of Community Health,2022,2,The Most Important Skills Required by Local Public Health Departments for Responding to Community Needs and Improving Health Outcomes.,"In 2017, Public Health 3.0 was introduced, providing recommendations that expand traditional public department functions and programs. Operationalizing the framework requires that local health departments invest in the requisite professional skills to respond to their community's needs. The purpose of this paper is to determine the professional skills that are most important for local health departments to respond to large public health issues and challenges that are having a major impact on their communities. The study used a cross-sectional assessment of the education and training needs of local public health departments in Nebraska following the principles of practice-based systems research. The assessment was designed to assess the training and education needs of local health department staff members. The questions measured the perceived importance of and respondent's capacity across 57 core competencies for public health professionals modified from the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice. A total of 104 staff members from seven local health departments were requested to complete the assessment and 100% of the individuals responded to and completed the assessment. Twenty-eight skills were identified as the most important skills needed for local health departments. The skills were themed and categorized into four domains. (1) Data, Evaluation, and Quality Improvement, (2) Community Engagement and Facilitation, (3) Systems Thinking and Leadership, and (4) Policy and Advocacy. The results from this analysis provide direction to strengthen and transform the public health system into one that is connected, responsive, and nimble. Additionally, it also highlighted a glaring omission that Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion should be included as the fifth domain.","Grimm, Brandon","Ramos, Athena K.","Office of Public Health Practice, College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 68198-4335, Omaha, NE, USA"
Psychology of Leaders & Leadership,2022,2,A New Era for Psychologist-Leaders: Introduction to the Society of Psychologists in Leadership and the Psychology of Leaders and Leadership.,"This article introduces the name change of the Society of Psychologists in Leadership (SPL), from the Society of Psychologists in Management (SPIM). SPL seeks to become the premier home for psychologists who are also executives, managers, leaders, and consultants, and for psychologists who aspire to leadership positions in their organization, locally, nationally, or globally. In this article, we first discuss the founding and early years of SPIM as critical development in the recognition of psychologists as managers and leaders. Then we discuss societal and cultural changes that led to consideration of SPL rebranding and name change, including discussions of cultural and academic changes in the connotation of management versus leadership, an increasing emphasis on psychologists as leaders, and a cultural increase in focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We discuss the board's mixedmethods approach to assessing the needs of its members, expanding the membership and value of the organization, recognizing and honoring the founders and early members, ensuring a unique identity and value of SPL, and revitalizing and refocusing the academic journal. We conclude with considerations of the future of SPL to serve psychologists in leadership in the 21st century.","Wisdom, Jennifer P.","Stacia, Robin","Wisdom Consulting, New York, New York, United States"
Research on Social Work Practice,2022,1,A Study of PhD Courses and Curricula Across Schools of Social Work.,"Objectives: This study explored courses offered by social work PhD programs, the variation in these courses by type of university, and how the courses compare to the Group for the Advancement of Doctoral Education in Social Work (GADE) Quality Guidelines. Study Methods: Course curriculums of 84 GADE-affiliated social work PhD programs were double-blind coded. PhD directors verified codes and answered a brief survey. Findings: A total of 1146 courses were coded into 28 categories. An average of six research and statistics courses were offered per program. Few programs offered courses in measurement, intervention research, meta-analysis, program evaluation, or grant writing. Most programs indicated that diversity, equity, and inclusion was infused in the curriculum. Less than half (41%) of PhD program directors indicated that GADE Quality Guidelines were influential. Conclusions: PhD programs are offering more research and statistics courses than in the past, but GADE Quality Guidelines are not consistently followed.","Franklin, Cynthia","Lightfoot, Elizabeth","Steve Hicks School of Social Work, 12330 The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"
Collaborative Librarianship,2022,1,Challenging the Glass Ceiling: Collaboration as the Key to Increasing the Number of Librarians of Color in Academic Libraries.,"Currently, libraries are engaged in creating environments that embrace diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). This includes having candidates for hire submit statements regarding their approach to DEI and internal committees to look at policies and procedures regarding DEI. Also, there is a lot of both internal and external training designed to help organizations and their members become more adept at creating environments with DEI in mind. What is often missed in all of this activity is how individual librarians, through mentorship and collaboration, can come together to foster DEI and support each other in success. This field report shows how two librarians, from different backgrounds and experiences came together to not only support each other through their regular work day, but elevate their partnership toward professional success and retention. The report provides recommendations for creating a more inclusive workplace through mentoring and collaboration.","Reid, Janet M.","Sobczak, Patricia D.","Assistant Professor & Business Research Librarian, Virginia Commonwealth University"

Journal of Graduate Medical Education,2021,12,Transformative Learning in Graduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review.,"Transformative learning (TL) is an educational theory focused on deep fundamental shifts in an individual's worldview. Such shifts are well known to occur within graduate medical education (GME). However, TL in GME has yet to be formally explored. We performed a scoping review of the literature on TL within GME to identify areas where trainees currently experience or have potential to experience TL, and to explore areas where fostering TL has been used as a pedagogical tool. In January 2020, we searched 7 databases to identify literature on TL in GME. Additional articles were identified by hand-searching the Journal of Graduate Medical Education. A total of 956 articles were identified through database search with 3 unique articles found via hand-searching. Abstracts and manuscripts were screened by 2 authors and disagreements arbitrated by a third, yielding 28 articles for our analysis. The main components of TL (disorienting dilemma, reflection, discourse, action) took various forms. TL was closely linked with professionalism training and professional identity formation. Training programs in primary care fields were most frequently referenced. Often, trainees were experiencing TL without recognition of the theory by their educators. Gaps in the graduate medical education literature exist pertaining to TL in venues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our scoping review uncovered the following themes: TL and professionalism, TL and primary care, and TL by other names. TL is likely occurring but going unrecognized in some settings.","Vipler, Benjamin","Knehans, Amy",

Journal of Biomechanics,2023,4,Increasing accessibility to biomechanics for Black students with early exposure through NBD.,"From the perspective of a Black woman in the biomechanics field, it is my observation that many Black biomechanists are exposed to the field of biomechanics late into their academic careers. STEM (science, technology, and mathematics) is such a broad/encompassing field, yet students are only typically given a narrow introduction to biology and chemistry prior to college. These basic science courses are not enough to continue recruiting and building a pathway for future scientists to pursue STEM careers in the interdisciplinary field of biomechanics. Outreach programs, like National Biomechanics Day (NBD), can expose students to biomechanics earlier than the usual undergraduate exposure for those majoring in health/exercise science, kinesiology, or biomedical/mechanical engineering. NBD has increased accessibility to biomechanics, which has led to increases in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomechanics community, particularly for young Black students. Outreach programs like NBD are crucial to reaching, engaging, and recruiting future young Black biomechanists, and others from underrepresented communities, within the US and beyond.","Bell, Erica A.",,"Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"

Social Science & Medicine,2021,11,Blurred in translation: The influence of subjectivities and positionalities on the translation of health equity and inclusion policy initiatives in Aotearoa New Zealand.,"Growing health inequities among the increasingly diverse population in Aotearoa New Zealand have prompted responses in the healthcare system. Diversity-related policies and programmes have been developed in some District Health Boards (DHB) to address the issues. The translation of such policy into practice is, however, convoluted by subjective interests and power differentials and thus the outcomes of policies may deviate from their original objectives. In this paper we examine how staff in one DHB translate and implement health equity and diversity initiatives in their everyday practices in hospital settings. In high-level institutional thinking, Māori health equity policy is dictated by the Treaty of Waitangi which sets it apart from the cultural competence focus of programmes for other ethnic groups. Drawing on interviews with clinical staff in the DHB, we reveal how intersecting subject positions, including personal histories and institutional roles, influence the interpretation and enactment of these policies and programmes in ways that blur their distinct agendas. As a result, the paper demonstrates how the politics that underpin agendas that distinctly address equity and diversity, as well as the potential for change in these areas, can be compromised in everyday practice on the hospital floor. • Health equity policy programmes distinct for Māori and culturally diverse groups. • Distinct agendas are blurred as clinical staff translate them into practice. • Intersection of personal subjectivities and positionalities influence translations. • Blurring of agendas in everyday practice compromise potential for change.","Lee, Sandy","Collins, Francis L.","School of Environment, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand"

Evolution,2021,2,Who are we now? A demographic assessment of three evolution societies.,"Scientific societies have the potential to catalyze support for communities that have been historically excluded from science. Many of these societies have formed committees to propose and administer initiatives to promote the career and well‐being of their members, with a special emphasis on racial and ethnic minorities. Yet, these societies are rarely armed with data to inform their proposals. Three of the evolution societies (American Society of Naturalists, ""ASN""; Society of Systematic Biologists, ""SSB""; Society for the Study of Evolution, ""SSE"") have also formed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committees in the last few years. As a first step in determining the needs of the societies, these committees collected data on the demographic characteristics of the societies' constituents by surveying the attendants of the Evolution 2019 meeting. Here, we report the proportions for different demographic groups in attendance at the meeting and compare these proportions to the demographics of recipients of Ph.D. degrees either in evolutionary biology or in the broader life sciences, as well as population demographics of the USA. Our results indicate that historically excluded groups are still underrepresented across US‐based evolutionary biology professional societies. We explore whether demographic composition differs at different professional stages and find that representation for women and LGBTQ+ members decreases as the career stage progresses. We also find some evidence for heterogeneity across societies in terms of racial composition. Finally, we discuss the caveats and limitations of our procedures. Our results will serve to inform future efforts to collect demographic data at the society levels, which should in turn be used to design and implement evidence‐based initiatives for inclusion and equity. This report should be a starting point for systematic efforts to characterize the ever‐changing representation in evolutionary biology and to work toward the inclusion of all groups.","Rushworth, Catherine A.","Baucom, Regina S.","Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis California, 95616"

The method of negative case analysis is theoretically expanded upon using Adornian and Intersectional lenses and in doing so, it provides a means by which equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) can be substantiated in research design. ANCA is inclusive of underrepresented perspectives so that points of comparison can be created with the intent of challenging assumptions that have historically negated the experiences of diverse and equity-seeking groups. Understanding that negative case data require saturation, identities can be appreciated as irreducibly complex, but subsequently explored in relation to the universalizing social categories that work to sustain imbalanced power relations. To demonstrate how ANCA can be practically applied, the author will describe how it was used in her doctoral research study. Beginning with recruitment and following through to data analysis, this article provides a summary of how the substantiation of EDI in the design of a Constructivist Grounded Theory study transpired through ANCA.","Lane, Jennifer",,"School of Nursing, 3688 Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"

We identify key opportunities where qualitative and quantitative communication scholars can leverage the momentum of open science to critically reflect on and improve our knowledge production processes. We also examine competing values that incentivize dubious practices in communication research, and discuss several metascience initiatives to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in our field and value multiple ways of knowing.","Humphreys, Lee","Lewis, Neil A","Department of Communication, Cornell University , Ithaca, NY 14853, USA"
Journal of the Association for Information Science & Technology,2021,10,Outsiders‐within‐Library and Information Science: Reprioritizing the marginalized in critical sociocultural work.,"While there are calls for new paradigms within the profession, there are also existing subgenres that fit this bill if they would be fully acknowledged. This essay argues that underrepresented and otherwise marginalized scholars have already produced significant work within social, cultural, and community‐oriented paradigms; social justice and advocacy; and, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This work has not been sufficiently valued or promoted. Furthermore, the surrounding structural conditions have resulted in the dismissal, violently reviewed and rejected, and erased work of underrepresented scholars, and the stigmatization and delegitimization of their work. These scholars are ""outsiders‐within‐LIS."" By identifying the outsiders‐within‐LIS through the frame of standpoint theories, the authors are suggesting that a new paradigm does not need to be created; rather, an existing paradigm needs to be recognized and reprioritized. This reprioritized paradigm of critical sociocultural work has and will continue to creatively enrich and expand the field and decolonize LIS curricula.","Cooke, Nicole A.","Kitzie, Vanessa L.","School of Information Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia South Carolina, USA"
Pediatrics,2021,9,Innovative Wellness Models to Support Advancement and Retention Among Women Physicians.,"Despite improvements in representation of women in academic medicine, the rate of promotion and career advancement remains unequal. Compared with their male colleagues, women report lower rates of personal-organizational value alignment and higher rates of burnout. Particular challenges further exist for Black women, Indigenous women, women of color, and third gender or gender nonbinary faculty. Promoting the well-being of women physicians requires innovative approaches beyond the traditional scope of physician well-being efforts and careful attention to the unique barriers women face. Three wellness-oriented models are presented to promote the professional fulfillment and well-being of women physicians: (1) redefine productivity and create innovative work models, (2) promote equity through workplace redesign and burnout reduction, and (3) promote, measure, and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. By engaging in innovative models for equitable advancement and retention, it is anticipated that diverse groups of women faculty will be better represented at higher levels of leadership and thus contribute to the creation of more equitable work climates, fostering well-being for women physicians.","Ramas, Marie-Elizabeth","Webber, Sarah","GateHouse Treatment Center, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, Nashua, New Hampshire"

Medical Physics,2021,9,OpenKBP: The open‐access knowledge‐based planning grand challenge and dataset.,"Purpose: To advance fair and consistent comparisons of dose prediction methods for knowledge‐based planning (KBP) in radiation therapy research. Methods: We hosted OpenKBP, a 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge, and challenged participants to develop the best method for predicting the dose of contoured computed tomography (CT) images. The models were evaluated according to two separate scores: (a) dose score, which evaluates the full three‐dimensional (3D) dose distributions, and (b) dose‐volume histogram (DVH) score, which evaluates a set DVH metrics. We used these scores to quantify the quality of the models based on their out‐of‐sample predictions. To develop and test their models, participants were given the data of 340 patients who were treated for head‐and‐neck cancer with radiation therapy. The data were partitioned into training (n=200), validation (n=40), and testing (n=100) datasets. All participants performed training and validation with the corresponding datasets during the first (validation) phase of the Challenge. In the second (testing) phase, the participants used their model on the testing data to quantify the out‐of‐sample performance, which was hidden from participants and used to determine the final competition ranking. Participants also responded to a survey to summarize their models. Results: The Challenge attracted 195 participants from 28 countries, and 73 of those participants formed 44 teams in the validation phase, which received a total of 1750 submissions. The testing phase garnered submissions from 28 of those teams, which represents 28 unique prediction methods. On average, over the course of the validation phase, participants improved the dose and DVH scores of their models by a factor of 2.7 and 5.7, respectively. In the testing phase one model achieved the best dose score (2.429) and DVH score (1.478), which were both significantly better than the dose score (2.564) and the DVH score (1.529) that was achieved by the runner‐up models. Lastly, many of the top performing teams reported that they used generalizable techniques (e.g., ensembles) to achieve higher performance than their competition. Conclusion: OpenKBP is the first competition for knowledge‐based planning research. The Challenge helped launch the first platform that enables researchers to compare KBP prediction methods fairly and consistently using a large open‐source dataset and standardized metrics. OpenKBP has also democratized KBP research by making it accessible to everyone, which should help accelerate the progress of KBP research. The OpenKBP datasets are available publicly to help benchmark future KBP research.","Babier, Aaron","Zhang, Binghao","Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto ON, M5S 3G8,, Canada"

"Journal of Leadership, Accountability & Ethics",2021,9,HERLeadership: Addressing the Continued Lack of Women in Leadership.,"In this conceptual paper, we argue for theory adaptation of the K-12 educational leadership framework in Ontario, Canada. We propose that leadership characteristics, skills, values and behaviours for women and equity-seeking groups differ from traditional white, male-oriented leadership expectations. As an illustrative example, one recent study of women principal's experiences in leadership in one school district in Ontario is discussed. We further compared leadership behaviours of women from three different studies and found that authentic school leadership differs from the current leadership expectations that are identified and valued in Ontario. Leadership frameworks that are devoid of anti-racist, anti-oppression concepts and language fail to challenge norms and address concerns about power, discrimination, ethics, and organizational politics. Without addressing identity in leadership, organizational equity, diversity and inclusion strategies remain performative, create barriers, and possibly exacerbate gender and racial disparities.","Doan, Brandy","Jaber, Lindsey",University of Windsor
Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research®,2021,3,"How Do Medical Students Perceive Diversity in Orthopaedic Surgery, and How Do Their Perceptions Change After an Orthopaedic Clinical Rotation?","<bold>Background: </bold>A diverse physician workforce improves the quality of care for all patients, and there is a need for greater diversity in orthopaedic surgery. It is important that medical students of diverse backgrounds be encouraged to pursue the specialty, but to do so, we must understand students' perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics. We also currently lack knowledge about how participation in an orthopaedic clinical rotation might influence these perceptions.<bold>Questions/purposes: </bold>(1) How do the perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedic surgery compare among medical students of different gender identities, races or ethnicities, and sexual orientations? (2) How do perceptions change after an orthopaedic clinical rotation among members of demographic groups who are not the majority in orthopaedics (that is, cis-gender women, underrepresented racial minorities, other racial minorities, and nonheterosexual people)?<bold>Methods: </bold>We surveyed students from 27 US medical schools who had completed orthopaedic rotations. We asked about their demographic characteristics, rotation experience, perceptions of diversity and inclusion in orthopaedics, and personal views on specialty choice. Questions were derived from diversity, equity, and inclusion climate surveys used at major academic institutions. Cis-gender men and cis-gender women were defined as those who self-identified their gender as men or women, respectively, and were not transgender. Forty-five percent (59 of 131) of respondents were cis-men and 53% (70 of 131) were cis-women; 49% (64 of 131) were white, 20% (26 of 131) were of underrepresented racial minorities, and 31% (41 of 131) were of other races. Eighty-five percent (112 of 131) of respondents were heterosexual and 15% (19 of 131) reported having another sexual orientation. We compared prerotation and postrotation perceptions of diversity and inclusion between majority and nonmajority demographic groups for each demographic domain (for example, cis-men versus cis-women). We also compared prerotation to postrotation perceptions within each nonmajority demographic group. To identify potential confounding variables, we performed univariate analysis to compare student and rotation characteristics across the demographic groups, assessed using an alpha of 0.05. No potential confounders were identified. Statistical significance was assessed at a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of 0.0125. Our estimated response percentage was 26%. To determine limitations of nonresponse bias, we compared all early versus late responders and found that for three survey questions, late responders had a more favorable perception of diversity in orthopaedic surgery, whereas for most questions, there was no difference.<bold>Results: </bold>Before rotation, cis-women had lower agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic culture (mean score 0.96 ± 0.75) compared with cis-men (1.4 ± 1.1) (mean difference 0.48 [95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.81]; p = 0.004), viewed orthopaedic surgery as less diverse (cis-women 0.71 ± 0.73 versus cis-men 1.2 ± 0.92; mean difference 0.49 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.78]; p = 0.001) and more sexist (cis-women 1.3 ± 0.92 versus cis-men 1.9 ± 1.2; mean difference 0.61 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.99]; p = 0.002), believed they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally (cis-women 2.8 ± 1.0 versus cis-men 1.9 ± 1.3; mean difference 0.87 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.3]; p < 0.001), and were less likely to pursue orthopaedic surgery (cis-women 1.4 ± 1.4 versus cis-men 2.6 ± 1.1; mean difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.76 to 1.6]; p < 0.001). Before rotation, underrepresented minorities had less agreement that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (0.73 ± 0.72) compared with white students (1.5 ± 0.97) (mean difference 0.72 [95% CI 0.35 to 1.1]; p < 0.001). Many of these differences between nonmajority and majority demographic groups ceased to exist after rotation. Compared with their own prerotation beliefs, after rotation, cis-women believed more that diversity and inclusion are part of orthopaedic surgery culture (prerotation mean score 0.96 ± 0.75 versus postrotation mean score 1.2 ± 0.96; mean difference 0.60 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.98]; p = 0.002) and that orthopaedic surgery is friendlier (prerotation 2.3 ± 1.2 versus postrotation 2.6 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.41 [95% CI 0.14 to 0.69]; p = 0.004), more diverse (prerotation 0.71 ± 0.73 versus postrotation 1.0 ± 0.89; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.49]; p = 0.007), less sexist (prerotation 1.3 ± 0.92 versus postrotation 1.9 ± 1.0; mean difference 0.63 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.85]; p < 0.001), less homophobic (prerotation 2.1 ± 1.0 versus postrotation 2.4 ± 0.97; mean difference 0.27 [95% CI 0.062 to 0.47]; p = 0.011), and less racist (prerotation 2.3 ± 1.1 versus postrotation 2.5 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.28 [95% CI 0.099 to 0.47]; p = 0.003). Compared with before rotation, after rotation cis-women believed less that they would have to work harder than others to be valued equally on the rotation (prerotation 2.8 ± 1.0 versus postrotation 2.5 ± 1.0; mean difference 0.31 [95% CI 0.12 to 0.50]; p = 0.002), as did nonheterosexual students (prerotation 2.4 ± 1.4 versus postrotation 1.8 ± 1.3; mean difference 0.56 [95% 0.21 to 0.91]; p = 0.004). Underrepresented minority students saw orthopaedic surgery as less sexist after rotation compared with before rotation (prerotation 1.5 ± 1.1 versus postrotation 2.0 ± 1.1; mean difference 0.52 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.89]; p = 0.007).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Even with an estimated 26% response percentage, we found that medical students of demographic backgrounds who are not the majority in orthopaedics generally perceived that orthopaedic surgery is less diverse and inclusive than do their counterparts in majority groups, but these views often change after a clinical orthopaedic rotation.<bold>Clinical Relevance: </bold>These perceptions may be a barrier to diversification of the pool of medical student applicants to orthopaedics. However, participation in an orthopaedic surgery rotation is associated with mitigation of many of these negative perceptions among diverse students. Medical schools have a responsibility to develop a diverse workforce, and given our findings, schools should promote participation in a clinical orthopaedic rotation. Residency programs and orthopaedic organizations can also increase exposure to the field through the rotation and other means. Doing so may ultimately diversify the orthopaedic surgeon workforce and improve care for all orthopaedic patients.","Rahman, Rafa",Bo Zhang,"The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"
Creative Nursing,2019,10,Diverse Representation in Nursing Leadership: Developing a Shared Position Statement on Allyship.,"Diversity initiatives are being implemented widely within academia and society more broadly; however, the School of Nursing (SoN) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, is taking an innovative approach. Faculty members recognized the need to support students at the graduate and undergraduate levels from Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Two-Spirit), and International communities in a student-led initiative with the mission to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity within the SoN. This coalition seeks to offer students who are often rendered invisible within the academy and society more broadly in relation to dominant cultures and normative expectations an opportunity to build relationships and expose shared histories of oppression in such a way that issues of social justice are uncovered. In response to nursing students and faculty who self-identify as members of dominant groups and who sought inclusion as allies, the leaders of the student community groups recognized a need to develop a position statement on allyship. The collaboration that transpired between the four groups of communities to develop the position statement led to the formation of the Student Equity Coalition. This article begins with the authors' definition of allyship, followed by a description of the context in which this unique initiative is taking place, the rationale behind developing a shared position statement on allyship, and the significance of this work in positioning and supporting nursing students of minority status as emerging nurse leaders.","Lane, Jennifer","Carrier, Leah",

In the workplace, equity is achieved via collective action, which means that you work with your coworkers to attain a common goal of equity."" They also note problems that the DEI/diversity, equity, and inclusion industry has had in organizations, even in today's landscape where we have greater overall awareness of these topics. ""With Shared Sisterhood,"" they write, ""we ask whether the power to change lies in growing and connecting with others and using those connections to foment the dismantling of systemic inequities."" They outline various steps individuals can take, each of which is described in more detail in the article. Some are, in their words: Keep reading; Follow people from different racioethnic groups on social media; and engage with different news sources. These are followed by interpersonal steps, such as Create book clubs or discussion circles to practice Shared Sisterhood exercises, and Create partnerships with other people to hold each other accountable for working toward equity.","Opie, Tina","Livingston, Beth A.",

JGE: The Journal of General Education,2017,1,General Education: The Front Lines of Equity and Inclusion at a Midsize Public University.,"Unequal academic outcomes in postsecondary education persist for students from underserved populations (students of color, low socioeconomic status, first-generation), despite increased access to higher education in the last half century. General education classes present prime opportunities to address academic inequity. They typically have larger enrollments than major studies courses, are taken by more first-year students, and often serve as gateway courses for admission into numerous academic programs. Identifying pockets of underachievement—equity gaps—among discrete populations is a critical first step in ensuring that institutions support and meet the needs of all students. Equity-mindedness, which views student success as a shared responsibility between the student and the institution, is a second vital component for achieving academic equity. This article discusses two large initiatives undertaken at a midsized public university that are designed to achieve academic equity for all students: the identification and elimination of academic equity gaps among students from underserved populations, especially in general education courses, and the development of an equity-minded campus culture that embraces diversity and serves all students equally.","Klonoski, Ed","Barker, Gregory",

Building on theories of language that multilingualism is a student's strength not a deficit, the book will help faculty, staff, and graduate teaching assistants design lessons, courses, professional development opportunities, and writing center programs that support multilingual students and challenge notions that success on US campuses requires strict adherence to communicating in Standard Academic English (SAE). Through a highly engaging series of studies, the authors in this collection provide evidence that their approaches strengthen their writing pedagogies and empower their students. Although this book is primarily addressed to writing instructors, it may have some utility for professional communicators in industry. The rhetorical listening framework outlined in Chapter 10 would support in-house training on communicating across differences. The editors note that their work on the collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, another relevant context emerged that is not addressed in the book explicitly. Following now-revoked Executive Order 13950, more than half of US states have enacted or are debating laws that would restrict classroom and professional development training around issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. These laws may affect state-funded universities in ways that limit educators' ability to enact the pedagogies described in this collection.",,,

National Journal of Integrated Research in Medicine,2017,11,Professional Identity and Performance Appraisal:Implications for Indian Medical Education.,"Teaching professionalism is important in the development of a health professional who is competent and responsive to the needs of the community. More recently, the concept of professionalism has expanded to include supporting students in the development of their professional identity. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the effect of diversity on the formation of professional identity, as well as the role of diversity in the development of a robust performance appraisal system. Considerable research has established that greater diversity in medicine, particularly in terms of gender and race, positively influences professional identity formation. This is because diverse identities bring unique perspectives and skills, exposure to which enhances educational experiences and contributes to identity formation. Issues related to language, communication, attire and impression management can be addressed through this sort of contact. Performance appraisals have been found to be a major source of discrimination in managing diversity and equity in workplace. There are many unconscious biases and assumptions related to identities including gender, race and nationality which need to be addressed in developing a fair and equitable performance appraisal system. Researchers have shown that the first step in combating biases is to increase an awareness of one's own biases, and then learn skills to deal with them in a way that is fair and non-judgmental. Faculty development programs can address this goal to some extent. While there are several such programs globally, in India there is a need for faculty development programs that address the issue of biases. The existing national faculty development program led by Medical Council of India and the programs by the Foundation for Advancement of International Education and Research (FAIMER) Regional Institutes in India can add inclusion and biases to their programs.","Vyas, Rashmi","Hirshfield, Laura E.","Assistant Vice President Education, Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) and Director, FAIMER Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA"
Australasian Journal of Early Childhood,2017,9,Spaces for gender equity in Australian early childhood education in/between discourses of human capital and feminism.,"IN THIS ARTICLE WE use feminist post-structuralist concepts of discourse and relations of power to question how a neoliberal regime of truth in Australian early childhood education impacts educators currently working for gender equity with children, prior to their entry to schooling. We show how this regime of truth is endorsed and transferred in and by key documents of the Australian National Quality Framework (NQF) including the National Quality Standard (NQS) and the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) in which discourses of universal rights, individual freedom and choice, and human capital dominate approaches to inclusion and diversity that govern gender equity work (ACECQA, 2011, 2017a, 2017b; DEEWR, 2009; NSW Education, 2016). Our article addresses how some educators use their understandings of feminism to negotiate spaces for gender equity work within the theoretical, political and ethical tensions arising in/between discourses that constitute this neoliberal regime of truth.","Campbell, Sheralyn","Smith, Kylie",University of Melbourne
Curriculum & Teaching Dialogue,2017,9,CHAPTER 1: QUEERING TEACHER EDUCATION CURRICULUM: A Case Study of Lessons Learned in the Transformation of a Teacher Education Program.,"The University of Oregon Teacher Education Program (UOTeach) was created in response to local grassroots protests that forced the University to create new courses and degrees with an emphasis on promoting equity, diversity, and justice in schools. This case study examines the way institutional support was made more readily available for changes that addressed racial and cultural dimensions of education justice, and less readily available for gender and sexuality-based justice in schools. What follows is a story of both visibility and invisibility. At one level it is a story of a place and a context in which the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students and families have achieved a relatively high level of presence in a teacher education curriculum. On the other hand, it is a story of the precariousness of inclusiveness, of the way the need for LGBTQ-positive curriculum so easily slips from institutional memory, and of the difficulty of ensuring the institutional security of queer content in teacher education programs. In what follows, we present a case study of an effort to include increased attention to LGBTQ justice within a more comprehensive reform of the curriculum of a graduate-level teacher education program. We recount several ways in which this inclusion was achieved, highlighting the conditions and history that made these accomplishments possible. Along the way, we reflect on the extent to which these changes have been institutionalized in the teacher education program. Where they have not, we examine the discursively constituted silences and invisibility that has made such institutionalization difficult. We conclude with some lessons learned and implications for future efforts to queer teacher education curriculum.","Rosiek, Jerry","Schmitke, Alison",

(Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(10):998–1010) present findings from a survey used to collect information to characterize diversity among epidemiologists and perceptions of inclusion in the epidemiologic profession. They capture identity across a range of personal characteristics, including race, gender, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, religion, and political leaning. In this commentary, we assert that the inclusion of political leaning as an axis of identity alongside the others undermines the larger project of promoting diversity and inclusion in the profession and is symptomatic of the movement for ""ideological diversity"" in higher education. We identify why political leaning is not an appropriate metric of diversity and detail why prioritizing ideological diversity counterintuitively can work against equity building initiatives. As an alternative to ideological diversity, we propose that epidemiologists take up an existing framework for research and practice that centers the voices and perspectives of historically marginalized populations in epidemiologic work.","Allen, Bennett","Lewis, Ashley",

Annals of Family Medicine,2022,3,The EMBOLDEN Co-design study: Partnering with older adults and communities to develop a community program to enhance mobility.,"Context: Physical mobility and social participation are requisite for independence and quality of life as one ages. Barriers to mobility lead to social isolation, poor physical and mental health, all of which are precursors to frailty. To date, most mobility-enhancing interventions in older adults have been designed by researchers without citizen input and delivered in controlled settings; their translation to real-world contexts is often impractical and rarely occurs. Objectives: i) To engage older adults and community service providers to qualitatively explore priorities, needs, enablers and barriers to mobility and community participation faced by older adults, and ii) To co-design an evidence-informed, feasible, acceptable group intervention to support mobility and promote health among older adults facing health inequities. Study Design: Adapted experience-based co-design, conducted in collaboration with a Strategic Guiding Council comprised of older adults and service providers. Setting: Community-based. Population studied: Community-dwelling older adults (55+) and local health and social service providers. Outcome Measures: EMBOLDEN's Strategic Guiding Council and the research team collectively interpreted qualitative study findings, together with results of completed systematic reviews and an environmental scan, to determine priority design features of a community-based mobility-enhancing intervention to enable health and well-being in older adults in Hamilton, ON. Results: Eighteen diverse older adults and 16 service providers completed persona scenario interviews. These lived experience perspectives were analyzed, interpreted, and integrated with research and local evidence in the intervention co-design process. Priority design features for the intervention included duration, intensity, mode of delivery, characteristics of interventionists, and implementation strategies. Findings highlighted key strategies related to participant motivation, recruitment, and engagement, as well as important equity, diversity, and inclusion considerations. Conclusions: Partnering with diverse stakeholders is critical to identifying optimal design features of a community-based intervention to promote mobility. Ultimately, we aim to implement and evaluate a health promoting intervention that is sustainable, scalable, addresses health inequities, and effectively improves the lives of older adults.",,,

BACKGROUND: There is significant growth in the racial and ethnic diversity across students at all levels of higher education, mirroring the growing diversity of the US population. Yet, lower rates of persistence and higher attrition rates among these student groups continue. METHOD: The authors established six socially imposed forces, causative domains, as foundational to the SDOL framework. Key attributes of each domain were identified through a literature search. A case study illustrates an initial study of interventions targeting specific domains of the framework aimed toward student success. CONCLUSION: Equitable education for all has far-reaching implications across nursing education and higher education in general. Further development and testing of the SDOL framework will support the goal of equitable education for all.","Sanderson, Carla D.","Hollinger-Smith, Linda M.","Provost, Chamberlain University, Chicago, Illinois"

American Journal of Health Promotion,2021,6,Crossing the Empathy Chasm: Unpacking a Knapsack Full of Unearned Advantage.,"As demand for diversity, equity and inclusion workshops has risen sharply this past year, I'm not the first to observe that the burden for finding solutions, ironically, gets inordinately placed at the feet of people of color. Ironic, of course, because changing the hearts and minds of Whites is a challenge that needs to be met by Whites. McIntosh's White privilege scale has inspired a growing number of other scales that help us examine our unconscious bias, privilege and advantages from our lived experiences. Deepening empathy for people of color is a prerequisite to being of any use whatsoever in a profession committed to health equity. An obvious way to cross the empathy chasm is to be sure those who are accountable for finding solutions have a deep affinity with those who are most directly affected by the problems. In my continued work to cross the empathy chasm, the space I take needs to be as someone intent on listening to, learning from and supporting those with empathy to spare.","Terry, Paul E.",,"444143Health Enhancement Research Organization (HERO), Waconia, MN, USA"

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2023,5,Crucial Connections: What Should Palliative Care Clinicians Know about Religiously Observant Jewish Patients? (Sci219).,"1. Upon successful completion, participants will self-report the ability to describe the particular challenges and opportunities of serious illness care for patients and families who self-identify as highly observant Jewish patients. 2. Upon successful completion, participants wiill self-report the ability to mitigate communication difficulties with highly observant Jewish patients and families to support equitable serious illness care for all populations. Structurally marginalized groups are at increased risk of receiving low-quality end-of-life care, including reduced involvement of palliative care and hospice services. Although not often centered in discussions of diversity, inclusion, and equity, patients from minority religious communities within the United States experience a variety of challenges in accessing health care throughout the lifespan. Highly observant Jewish patients have been shown in recent investigations to be underserved in serious illness due to linguistic and cultural factors, as well as interpersonal misunderstandings between healthcare workers and patients/families. Through this poster, we will offer three real-life case examples of palliative care involvement in the healthcare experiences of highly observant Jewish patients. We will present the current literature regarding barriers to palliative care provision among highly observant Jewish populations from both medical and spiritual care perspectives. We will then present key concepts from the Jewish legal and ethical tradition applicable in situations of serious illness and dying. Specifically we will highlight the categories of treifah (seriously ill person), goses (actively dying person), and pikuach nefesh (principle of saving a life) through textual excerpts and case-oriented explanation. Palliative care clinicians may benefit from awareness of these essential concepts in their care of religiously observant Jewish patients. Finally, we will offer suggested language and approaches for palliative care clinicians to offer culturally sensitive and trauma-informed care to highly observant Jewish patients and families.","Rosenberg, Leah B.","Davis, Getzel",Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School
Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2023,5,"Beyond Bystanders: Training Palliative Care Clinicians in ""Upstander"" Allyship (TH106A).","1. Understand how palliative care teams can play a unique role in addressing microaggressions in the workplace. 2. Implement an action-oriented, participatory training around interrupting microaggressions in the workplace. The healthcare world is moving to address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Implicit bias training is now a requirement for healthcare workers in at least four states. In this context, we discuss developing a training about identifying and interrupting microaggressions specifically for palliative care clinicians. We leveraged existing antiracism work within our institution, the concept of the ""5Ds"" of bystander intervention, and a recent reflection in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, which discusses how core palliative care tools can be inadequate when responding to microaggressions. After initial development, we sought feedback from the Penn Palliative Care DEI Taskforce on content and structure. The final product was a 2-hour training, delivered in two parts: (1) The first portion established baseline knowledge of key definitions, terms, and concepts. The structure was primarily didactic, with a brief breakout to connect these concepts into the workplace. (2) The second hour taught the 5Ds of bystander intervention within the context of palliative care. In a 30-minute breakout, participants used a handout to self-facilitate skills practice in small groups using case studies. The training concluded with debriefing, education in how to apologize and asking participants to self-identify next steps. Combining didactics and skills practice in a bystander intervention training is a feasible model for palliative care clinicians. It integrates well into regular educational sessions, empowers clinicians to interrupt microaggressions, and serves as an additional tool for creating an antiracist culture within a healthcare setting. 1.

Epilepsy & Behavior,2023,4,"Detect, predict, and prevent acute seizures and status epilepticus.","Status epilepticus is one of the most frequent pediatric neurological emergencies. While etiology is often influencing the outcome, more easily modifiable risk factors of outcome include detection of prolonged convulsive seizures and status epilepticus and appropriately dosed and timely applied medication treatment. Unpredictability and delayed or incomplete treatment may at times lead to longer seizures, thereby affecting outcomes. Barriers in the care of acute seizures and status epilepticus include the identification of patients at greatest risk of convulsive status epilepticus, potential stigma, distrust, and uncertainties in acute seizure care, including caregivers, physicians, and patients. Furthermore, unpredictability, detection capability, and identification of acute seizures and status epilepticus, limitations in access to obtaining and maintaining appropriate treatment, and rescue treatment options pose challenges. Additionally, timing and dosing of treatment and related acute management algorithms, potential variations in care due to healthcare and physician culture and preference, and factors related to access, equity, diversity, and inclusion of care.

Journal of Environmental Management,2023,3,Confronting a post-pandemic new-normal—threats and opportunities to trust-based relationships in natural resource science and management.,"Natural resource governance is inherently complex owing to the socio-ecological systems in which it is embedded. Working arrangements have been fundamentally transformed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with potential negative impacts on trust-based social networks foundational to resource management and transboundary governance. To inform development of a post-pandemic new-normal in resource management, we examined trust relationships using the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America as a case study. 82.9% (n = 97/117) of Great Lakes fishery managers and scientists surveyed indicated that virtual engagement was effective for maintaining well-established relationships during the pandemic; however, 76.7% (n = 89/116) of respondents indicated in-person engagement to be more effective than virtual engagement for building and maintaining trust. Despite some shortcomings, virtual or remote engagement presents opportunities, such as: (1) care and nurturing of well-established long-term relationships; (2) short-term (1–3 years) trust maintenance; (3) peer-peer or mentor-mentee coordination; (4) supplemental communications; (5) producer-push knowledge dissemination; and, if done thoughtfully, (6) enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Without change, pre-pandemic trust-based relationships foundational to cooperative, multinational, resource management are under threat. • A post-pandemic new-normal is emerging in natural resource fields. • Only 26% of fishery professionals established trust-relationships during the pandemic. • 76% of survey respondents said in-person was more effective than virtual engagement. • Trust relationships key to multinational resource management are under threat. • Governments should prioritize trust-relationships in a post-pandemic new-normal.","Muir, A.M.","Bernhardt, J.R.","Great Lakes Fishery Commission, 2200 Commonwealth Blvd., Suite 100, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA"

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2023,3,"Microaggressions: Understanding How Microaggressions Can Limit Palliative Care in Teams, Clinical Care, and Ourselves (FR203A).","Outcomes: 1. Describe the four parts of microaggressions and identify these in palliative care research, clinical care, and interpersonally 2. Employ strategies to mitigate the impact of microaggressions in teams, research, and clinical care Microaggressions are brief statements or behaviors that intentionally, or not, communicate a negative message. Microaggressions are the manifestation of conceptualized learned behaviors that are informed by implicit/explicit biases. Palliative care and AAHPM are striving to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in research, clinical care, institutions, and the workforce. Understanding the concept of microaggressions and how it impacts these key areas will be important to palliative care achieving its DEI goals and upholding the profession's values. Using an evidence-driven and case-based format, this presentation will lead the audience through a deep dive into the four parts of microaggression listed below and how they impact research, team dynamics, institutions, and clinical care. 1. Microinsult: verbal and nonverbal communications that subtly convey rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity 2. Microinvalidation: verbal comments or behaviors that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person 3. Environmental microaggression: involves something in a person's environment that sends a message of invalidation of a marginalized group 4. Micro-assault: overt and conscious-explicit or subtle slights and insults expressed to marginalized groups The cases will be relevant to palliative care and have examples of microaggressions that have occurred in research, clinical programs, and interpersonally in our field. The audience will be led through an exercise to reflect on their experience with these types of microaggressions. They will also be provided with practical tools to address, diffuse, and create an environment that is psychologically safe and inclusive.","Curseen, Kimberly A.","George, Masil",Emory School of Medicine

American Antiquity,2020,7,Who Writes about Archaeology? An Intersectional Study of Authorship in Archaeological Journals.,"Since the 1980s, activist archaeologists have used quantitative studies of journal authorship to show that the demographics of archaeological knowledge production are homogeneous. This literature, however, focuses almost exclusively on the gender of archaeologists, without deeply engaging with other forms of identity or adequately addressing the methodological limitations of assigning binary gender identifications based on first names. This paper rectifies these limitations through an intersectional study of inequities in academic archaeological publications by presenting the results of a survey of authors who published in 21 archaeology journals over a 10-year period (2007-2016). This survey asked them to provide their self-identifications in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. The results demonstrate that although there has been an influx of women archaeologists in recent decades, we have not yet reached gender parity. They also show that because many women archaeologists are cisgender, white, and heterosexual, the discipline's knowledge producers remain relatively homogeneous. Furthermore, although there is demographic variation between journals, there is a strong correlation between journal prestige and the percentage of authors who are straight, white, cisgender men. This intersectional study of journal authorship demographics provides a comprehensive perspective on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the discipline of archaeology.","Heath-Stout, Laura E.",,"Department of Anthropology, Rice University, PO Box 1892, 6100 Main St., Houston, TX 77005, USA"

Advances in Physiology Education,2019,6,Implementing inclusive practices in an active learning STEM classroom.,"What do you bring to a conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion? While acknowledging this conversation is important, many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty shy away from engaging these topics. STEM educators often hesitate to participate in these discussions due to their self-perceived lack of knowledge or training. However, as institutions welcome ever-diversifying student populations, STEM faculty must consider how their teaching and mentoring approaches affect their students. During the 2018 American Physiological Society (APS) Institute for Teaching and Learning, STEM faculty and administrators engaged in conversations to better understand how their own approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion affect the success of their students. During my plenary workshop, “Inclusive Practices for Diverse Student Populations,” participants investigated their own perspectives and practices. They also discussed approaches to implementing inclusive practices that complement active pedagogical best practices. In an attempt to replicate this workshop environment, I ask you to engage with an interactive set of exercises to investigate your own perspective on the topics of diversity, inclusion, and equity. After you consider your own approaches to these topics, I provide practical examples of inclusive practices that align or enhance active leaning pedagogy. By building confidence, providing support, and promoting various pathways to success, inclusive practices enhance student learning and decrease social disparities in STEM education, ultimately supporting STEM innovation.","Johnson, Kathryn M.

The need for DEIawareness programming has increased as student populations become more diverse. Therefore, the objective of this work was to understand how included students felt in the Department of Animal Science. A survey instrument using Qualtrics was developed and distributed to 1,047 undergraduate and graduate students. A total of 436 participants completed at least a portion of the survey (response rate = 41.6%). Information will be presented descriptively. Approximately 56%, 29%, and 15% of participants came from rural, suburban, and urban areas, respectively. Additionally, 36% reported having no previous livestock experience. Participants were asked to rank their perceived level of inclusion in different facets of the department when starting in the major. Approximately 11%, 14%, and 13% felt that they were not included in class, with peers, and with faculty, respectively, when starting their degree program. Conversely, 24%, 22% and 26% felt very included in class, with peers, and with faculty, respectively, upon entering the major. Juniors, seniors, and graduates were asked to rank their level of inclusion in the same three areas after being in the department for at least two years. Only 2%, 10%, and 5% of these students reported feeling not included in class, with peers, and with faculty, respectively. Roughly 39%, 34%, and 39% of experienced students felt very included in class, with peers, and with faculty, respectively. Although inclusion feelings improved in mature students, there is still concern some students still do not feel that they belonged. Further analysis is needed to identify student attributes that do not feel included throughout the degree program and to identify tools that could help improve inclusion.","Carlson, Kelsi","Bundy, Jennifer M.",Iowa State University

Qualitative Social Work,2022,12,“Band-Aids on Bullet Holes”: Experiences of pediatric hospital social workers after 1 year of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"COVID-19 has continued to bring devastation to children and families, even 1 year into the pandemic. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has also led to renewed attention to systemic racism in the United States and awareness of how the pandemic has further exacerbated health inequities that disproportionately affect communities of color. Pediatric hospital social workers have played a key role since the beginning of the pandemic in responding to the resulting behavioral health crisis and helping to address social disparities. There is a need to understand how the roles and experiences of pediatric social workers have evolved during the first year of the pandemic. In this qualitative study, a series of practice-setting based focus groups were conducted with social workers to capture (a) what has changed or stayed the same since the beginning of COVID-19, (b) thoughts and experiences on diversity, equity, and inclusion with particular attention to race and racism, and (c) perspectives about the long-term implications of COVID-19 on the profession of social work. The Framework Method was used to analyze data, from which six superordinate themes emerged: burnout/coping; the impact of patient acuity; awareness of racial inequity in patient care; awareness of social determinants of health; social worker inclusion in hospital decision-making and policy reform; and grief/racial inequity. An overview of what has stayed the same, what has changed, and what the future may hold for pediatric hospital social workers is reviewed.",,,

Teachers College Record,2021,5,"The Promise of Private Education: A Case Study of Racialized, Gendered, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Achievement in One Private School.","Background: Private schools have a big part in the educational landscape in the United States, both in terms of the number of students they educate and in the number of resources they command. That said, despite expectations to increase equity and access to opportunity for all students, little is known about racial, gender, or socioeconomic achievement trends in this setting. Unlike public schools, there is very limited national-level achievement data infrastructure for private schools. Analyses of individual schools can begin to illuminate trends in particular contexts. Purpose of Study: This study examines how achievement differs by race, gender, and socioeconomic status in one private school in the United States, Gardenview Preparatory School (GPS; a pseudonym). Setting: GPS is a traditional private school serving students pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, located in a wealthy, predominantly White suburban area of a larger metropolitan region. Leadership in the school have attempted to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work. One of their attempts was to seek a research collaboration with the authors of this article. Participants: The primary focus of this article included a quantitative sample of all students graduating from GPS between the years of 2010 to 2017 (N=1216). Research Design: While the larger research collaboration included mixed methods, this article presents multivariable regression models using secondary data. Significant features of the regression models include (1) achievement measures at both admissions to GPS and graduation from GPS, (2) multiple measures of achievement at graduation, and (3) intersectional analyses. Findings: A key takeaway from this analysis is that demographics are not largely predictive of admissions test performance at GPS. A second key takeaway, however, is that once GPS students reached high school graduation, larger and more widespread racial, gendered, and socioeconomic disparities emerged. The third major takeaway from the analysis is that intersections of race and gender do impact achievement upon graduation from GPS. Conclusions: This study is one of the first of its kind to use advanced multivariable regression to map achievement disparities--at multiple timepoints in a student's career and using multiple measures of achievement--in a traditional, private school. Without understanding the existence, nature, and extent of achievement disparities, stakeholders cannot act intentionally to promote equity in private schools and beyond.","Harris, Kelly M.","Marcucci, Olivia",

Journal of Museum Education,2021,3,Creating Better Transatlantic Understandings: Defining Our Terms.,"Understanding the weight of words and how they are used as signifiers of social and political ideas became important during the Transatlantic Seminar – a four-day seminar organized by Fulbright Germany and the Leibniz Association, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C – and a glossary of sorts resulted. In exploring terms like DEAI (diversity, equity, accessibility and inclusion), collaboration, and discourses, the bigger socio-culture constructs that are associated with them became clear. Discussing inclusivity, race, accessibility, and many other challenging concepts was more difficult for the lack of understanding about one another's cultures. Careful consideration and reflection was needed to clearly explain the terms across linguistic and cultural boundaries, and doing this work required a reflexive practice, time, and trusted colleagues. In creating definitions the historical and cultural constructs of our respective nations as well as our education, personal experiences, and professional experiences were all brought to bear, each of us recognizing that we speak for ourselves and our perceptions of the field.","Hatcher, Sarah Junk","Hirsch, Vanessa",

Behavioral Sciences (2076-328X),2022,2,Next Steps: Applying a Trauma-Informed Model to Create an Anti-Racist Organizational Culture.,"Although there has been a significant increase in the delivery of evidence-supported, trauma-informed care over the past few years, there has been less discussion around the consideration of the broader cultural, political, and societal factors that contextualize client trauma and that also need to be recognized and understood to promote healing and prevent future trauma. In support of sharing some best practices and lessons learned, this article provides a case study of one agency that has used the Sanctuary Model®, an evidence-supported, trauma-informed organizational change model, to introduce the practice of cultural humility with staff as a facilitator of improved service delivery for clients from culturally marginalized communities. The model supports these endeavors through the adherence to the seven commitments, a set of organizational values for creating a trauma-informed community, allowing for all voices to be heard and considered and providing opportunities to begin the repair of previous experiences of inequity and suppression. Through the board of directors, leadership, and staff, the organization transformed its culture into one that truly supports and embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion in its operation for the benefit of both staff and clients alike.","Esaki, Nina","Reddy, Maxine","Springfield College, 263 Alden St, Springfield, MA 01109, USA"

Teaching & Teacher Education,2022,4,On the exploitation of cooperating teachers of color: Clinical practice as racial capitalism.,"In the United States, clinical practice—a critical component of initial teacher education—is largely predicated on the uncompensated labor of cooperating teachers. The practice of giving student teachers ""diverse"" placements has served as a veneer of diversity atop the Eurocentric compass of teacher education programs, which continue to be predominantly white and staffed by predominantly white faculty. Attending to matters of diversity and equity, teacher education programs have engaged in incremental changes, seeking to recruit more cooperating teachers of color. However, despite their contributions to the preparation of teachers, the voices of cooperating teachers remain marginalized and silenced in teacher education. Centering the voices of cooperating teachers of color, in this article I employ racial capitalism as theoretical lens and questionnaire as method to document and learn from their beliefs, experiences, and insights. Findings unveil the troubling positionings and tenuous location of these de facto school-based teacher educators to be rife with contradictions. While teacher education programs benefit from the labor of cooperating teachers of color, this labor is often unpaid and unsupported. Further, their location is an extractive site for the enactment of predatory inclusion. • Racial capitalism can unveil the extractive terms governing the work and role of cooperating teachers of Color. • Cooperating teachers of Color are oft silenced, marginalized, and excluded under the guise of inclusion in teacher education. • Oppositional methodologies afford centering the valuable voices, values, and experiences of cooperating teachers of Color. • Teacher education's predatory inclusion governs and safeguards its hierarchies, upholding the status quo of clinical practice. • The voices, experiences, and insights of cooperating teachers of Color offer transformative potential for teacher education.","Souto-Manning, Mariana",,"President, Irving and Neison Harris President's Chair, Erikson Institute, Graduate School in Child Development, 451 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL, 60654-4510, USA"

Academics in science often lack exposure to research on best practices in diversity, equity, and inclusion and may not know where to start to make scientific environments more welcoming and inclusive. We propose that by approaching research and teaching with empathy, flexibility, and a growth mind‐set, scientists can be more supportive and inclusive of their colleagues and students. This paper provides guidance, explores strategies, and directs scientists to resources to better cultivate an inclusive environment in three common settings: the classroom, the research laboratory, and the field. As ecologists and evolutionary scientists, we have an opportunity to adapt our teaching and research practices in order to foster an inclusive educational ecosystem for students and colleagues alike.","Emery, Nathan C.","Bledsoe, Ellen K.","Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing MI,, USA"

Australasian Journal of Early Childhood,2014,9,"Looking forward, looking back: Framing the future for teaching for social justice in early childhood education.","THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT that throughout the preschool years children are not only becoming more aware of themselves and their surroundings but they are also developing their moral frameworks by absorbing the attitudes and values of their family, culture and society. Undeniably the preschool years are crucial in shaping cultural and racial understandings and are critical in forming attitudes towards difference and diversity. Consequently, for a future characterised by justice, peace and understanding it is imperative that early childhood educators take responsibility in guiding children towards a positive attitude regarding difference and diversity, and upholding equity, justice and human dignity. However, teachers may struggle to find suitable pedagogical strategies that work to support and promote teaching for social justice and inclusion. This article highlights a doctoral study conducted in Australia that built upon successes in the US and UK that incorporated the use of children’s literature in prior-to-school settings. This article will outline the strategies that were successfully implemented by teachers involved in this collaborative study using children’s literature to promote and support teaching for social justice and inclusion. It is anticipated that teaching for social justice in the early years will form a foundation that will guide learners towards a lifelong concern for the valuing of difference, diversity, human dignity and justice.","Hawkins, Karen",,Southern Cross University

As academic leadership positions are rarely occupied by faculty from underrepresented gender and minoritized groups, inclusive mentorship practices are necessary to equip and support administrators of diverse backgrounds and identities. In this qualitative study, administrators from a school of public health in the southeastern United States present findings from an electronic survey exploring experiences with peer mentorship as it relates to leadership and training. Open-ended responses are compared with peer mentorship literature. Thematic analysis demonstrated peer mentorship is specifically beneficial for: 1) sharing knowledge and improving navigation, 2) cultivating change with respect and inclusivity, and 3) inspiring motivation and balance to prevent burnout. This study demonstrates the value of peer mentorship models for co-development of successful leadership qualities and for addressing administrative pressures through inclusive practices that promote diversity and improve equity.","Friedman, Daniela B.","Yelton, Brooks","University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, United States"

Journal of the American Planning Association,2016,3,Making Historic Preservation Sustainable.,"Problem, research strategy, and findings:Historic preservation has the potential to serve as a constructive agent of change within the built environment and to contribute to goals of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. However, tensions between sustainability goals and preservation policy and practice are impeding opportunities to forge common ground and a shared agenda. I review the existing literature related to the preservation–-sustainability nexus and critically analyze how preservation policies and practices conflict with or support key sustainability goals of energy consumption reduction, alternative energy production, urban densification, economic development, inclusion, diversity and participation, and intergenerational equity. Key findings of this research include the need to resolve tensions between sustainability and historic preservation practice through research and data, evolving preservation policies, and aligning historic preservation with the goals of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Takeaway for practice:The future of the preservation field and its engagement with sustainability goals hinge on the ability to contribute to environmental, economic, and social aims, but to also demonstrate why social concerns may sometimes trump economic and environmental ones given the fundamentally social aims of historic preservation. Understanding where tensions lie and why conflicts arise is an important step toward enhancing research about preservation outcomes and their contributions to sustainability and evolving preservation policy to better respond to changing environmental, economic, and societal conditions.","Avrami, Erica",,Columbia University

Innovative Higher Education,2022,12,The Complementarity Investment in University-Industry Collaboration.,"University-industry collaborations have been largely met with skepticism and resistance from faculty critics, who are concerned about the Academy adopting market-like behaviors and relying too heavily on industry. Yet, the pressures to engage in collaborations with industry, particularly to provide capital for universities, are likely to continue to increase. Guided by the capital-skill hypothesis, this study seeks to examine these realities through a case of a university-industry collaboration. We use an action research approach to analyze a collaboration between an academic college with a non-corporate centric focus at a public research university and a corporate entity within the healthcare field in which the college was contracted to develop a diversity, equity, and inclusion plan for the healthcare company. Findings illustrate how universities and industry can mutually benefit from collaborations when they adhere to what the authors refer to as the <italic>complementarity investment framework</italic>. Generated from the findings, this framework consists of four UIC design components: (a) the parties identify and clarify their roles, activities, and contributions to manage expectations; (b) the parties participate in learning exchanges, which are significantly valued as a component to this UIC; (c) the parties are open to experiences including unintended, yet positive, outcomes emerging from the UIC; and (d) the parties capitalize on the expert development by guiding and mentoring students as apprentices.","Sun, Jeffrey C.","Turner, Heather A.","Department of Educational Leadership, Evaluation, & Organizational Development, University of Louisville"
Archives of Dermatological Research,2022,12,Racial disparities in dermatology.,"Significant racial/ethnic disparities in dermatologic care and their subsequent impact on dermatologic conditions were recently reported. Contributing factors include socioeconomic factors, gaps in educational exposure, and underrepresentation of minority groups in the dermatologic workforce. In 2021, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) announced its three-year plan to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion in dermatology. One way to reduce disparities in dermatology is for every dermatologist, regardless of race or ethnicity, to receive adequate education in diseases, treatments, health equity, and tailored approaches to delivering dermatologic care with cultural humility. In addition, a diverse dermatologic workforce—especially at the level of residency program educators and organizational leaders—will contribute to improved cross-cultural understanding, more inclusive research efforts, and improved treatment approaches for conditions that are more prevalent or nuanced in certain racial/ethnic populations. Finally, the dermatology and broader healthcare community needs to acknowledge and educate ourselves on the health impacts of racism.","Narla, Shanthi","Heath, Candrice R.","Department of Dermatology, The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences"

Nonprofit & Voluntary Sector Quarterly,2022,8,Predictors of Nonprofit Ethno-Racial Diversity: Examining Local Community Demographics and Political Ideology.,"Although the practitioner and the academic literatures both note the importance of ethno-racial diversity in the nonprofit sector, we pursue a better understanding of this sector’s ethno-racial diversity dynamics by exploring the drivers of ethno-racial diversity at multiple organizational hierarchy levels—boards of directors, executive staff teams, and full-time staff. Using data from nonprofit organizations participating in Candid’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiative, we find evidence that upward mobility for ethno-racial minority group members remains limited. Our findings also indicate a positive relationship between ethno-racial diversity in a nonprofit’s local community and ethno-racial diversity at each organizational hierarchy level. This relationship is partially mediated by the political liberalness of the local community, with the strongest mediating effects at the board of directors and executive staff organizational levels. This partial mediation suggests that the local environment’s tolerance of societal hierarchies and unequal outcomes may be related to nonprofit organizational diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.","Rolf, Skylar","Tuggle, Chris","University of Houston–Clear Lake, TX, USA"
Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2022,6,Association and Causation Without Adequate Representation: An Evaluation of the Reporting of Race and Ethnicity of Study Participants in Hospice and Palliative Medicine Research (GP751).,"1. Increase knowledge of the amount variability in reporting of race and ethnicity in articles considered to be significant publications in the hospice and palliative medicine literature 2. Identify processes that may be used to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in palliative care research Convergence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minoritized communities and police violence against Black Americans has led to an increased focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism (DEIAR) in the medical literature. To examine the reporting of race and ethnicity in palliative care research. We selected original research conducted in the U.S. and presented at the AAHPM State of the Science (SOS) plenary from 2004 to 2019, as these articles are high impact and influence clinical practice. Two reviewers independently extracted variables from articles and then resolved disagreements. Descriptive analyses examined inclusion, reporting, and analysis of racial and ethnic groups in the studies. Eighty-eight of the 127 SOS articles met inclusion criteria. Over half (N = 46) tested an intervention, and 68.2% were funded by the National Institutes of Health. There were more than 48 unique racial and ethnic category labels; 82 articles included a race, and 46 included an ethnic category. The most common category specified was White (N = 78), followed by Black (N = 52), Hispanic/Latino (N = 35), Asian (N = 29), and American Indian/Alaska Native (N = 13). Over half the articles (N = 47) combined minoritized groups into a nonspecific category (e.g., other, nonwhites), and 25 articles specified only White populations alone or White populations with a nonspecific category for all other groups; 17 articles included over 90% White participants (maximum 98%). Only 3 articles had a health disparity focus. Most (N = 67) articles did not include race or ethnicity in the analysis. There are substantial opportunities to operationalize DEIAR principles in palliative care research. To ensure equitable outcomes for all seriously ill patients, the field should prioritize research that addresses disparities and creates inclusive standards for analysis and reporting of race and ethnicity to replace current practices that frequently center on White populations.","Rhodes, Ramona","Ejem, Deborah","Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center"

"Journal of Clinical Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)",2020,11,Embedding skin tone diversity into undergraduate nurse education: Through the lens of pressure injury.,"Objective: To explore health disparity in on‐campus undergraduate nurse education through the analysis of teaching and teaching material exploring pressure injuries. Background: As a discipline, nursing espouses ideologies of inclusion, equity and valuing diversity. However, little is known about how these ideologies translate into clinical care. Pressure injury prevention is a routine aspect of nursing care; yet, there is evidence of inequity in relation to clinical care and patient assessment, as people with darker skin tones have a higher prevalence of severe pressure injuries before detection of damage occurs. Despite limited literature being available surrounding the topic of pressure injuries and skin tone diversity, it remains the responsibility of nurse educators to address contemporary issues and health disparity within the nursing curriculum. Design: A multiple method collective case study. The STROBE checklist was followed in reporting this study. Methods: Documentary and observational data of lectures regarding pressure injuries were collected during 2017 and 2018 from five Higher Education Institutes in England delivering approved nursing undergraduate programmes. Results: Documentary analysis confirmed all Higher Education Institutes overwhelmingly directed teaching and learning activities about pressure injury towards people with Caucasian skin tones. Observation of teaching indicated all teaching sessions only contained brief, separate and superficial information on people with pressure injuries and darker skin tones. There was no discursive language or awareness of colour or colour blindness. Conclusion: Radical critique of all teaching and learning activities needs to occur, to help explore, improve and meaningfully and authentically include diversity and inclusivity in nurse education, and in particular, how people across the skin tone spectrum are included and represented in teaching and learning activities. Relevance to clinical practice: Critical examination of current teaching practice is crucial to address disparity and ensure care for people with darker skin tones is optimised.Nurse educators have a responsibility to educate for the care needs of all, as the quality of nurse education has a direct impact on care delivery and health disparity.This paper highlights the importance of addressing skin tone diversity and offers the opportunity for reflective practice, not just in formal education, but in clinical settings by preceptors and senior staff.","Oozageer Gunowa, Neesha","Brooke, Joanne","Faculty of Health & Life Sciences, Oxford Institute of Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Research (OxINMAHR), Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK"

The insight provided by the analysis of job announcements and a survey of current science/STEM librarians can assist new and current librarians looking for a position, recruiters hiring for a position, and professors reevaluating their MLIS/MLS curriculum. This study found that most positions are for full-time, permanent positions at an academic library located in the Midwest and on the East coast. Most of the positions are for research librarians with liaison duties in medicine/health science, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, and physics. A majority of the positions requires a Master's degree in library and information science from a program accredited by the American Library Association, and about half of the positions require or prefer a background in a related science/STEM field. While there is still no strong consensus on the necessity of a subject background and the responsibilities as a whole have not greatly changed, a demonstrated commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is now a common requirement. This study also highlights the top required skills and responsibilities and identifies insight and advice offered by current science/STEM librarians to future science/STEM librarians.","Sterner, Elizabeth",,"Health and Human Services Librarian, Governors State University, University Park, Illinois, USA"

"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics",2022,9,Design and implementation of a radiation oncology standardized letter of evaluation (RO-SLOE) for the evaluation of medical students and radiation oncology residency applicants.,"Prior research has shown that clerkship grades and letters of recommendation for radiation oncology residency applicants are susceptible to grade inflation and bias, both of which diminish the utility of these criteria when evaluating prospective candidates. This is especially pertinent in light of the shift of USMLE Step 1 to Pass/Fail and recent initiatives in our field to better promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Other fields such as emergency medicine have implemented a standardized letter of evaluation (SLOE) to address these and other concerns. This project will seek to design and adopt a new radiation oncology SLOE (RO-SLOE). Members of the Radiation Oncology Education Collaborative Study Group (ROECSG) Undergraduate Medical Education (UGME) working group designed a survey to assess attitudes regarding the efficacy and design of a RO-SLOE. This is conditionally approved under an educational IRB waiver and pending full IRB approval. The survey population will be members of the Association of Directors of Radiation Oncology Programs (ADROP), current residency program directors, and medical school clerkship directors. Our data will provide a contemporary snapshot of residency admissions practices, willingness of residency programs to consider the RO-SLOE in the admissions process and provide a framework to design novel questions for inclusion on a final RO-SLOE. We anticipate that a RO-SLOE would transparently reflect applicant's level of preparedness for residency compared to their peers, reflect institutional and evaluator grading practices, and allow for narrative feedback to qualify these objective metrics. We expect that the RO-SLOE will offer a novel, easily adaptable means to provide both actionable feedback to medical students and a standardized admissions criterion to residency programs to better discriminate between applicants. A RO-SLOE may promote greater diversity in the residency admissions process by minimizing sources of bias in clerkship evaluations and encouraging a shift to more holistic candidate review. By working with stakeholders, we hope to facilitate the RO-SLOE's incorporation into medical school clerkship evaluations and the residency application process.","Price, Jeremy G.","Bates, James E.","Temple University Hospital & Fox Chase Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Oncology"

Museum International,2020,6,Hidden in Plain Sight: In Quest of Women and their Stories in Greek Museums.,"The National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the Byzantine and Christian Museum, the Benaki Museum of Greek Culture and the Museum of Cycladic Art are among the finest museums in Greece. Their permanent collections include splendid, important works of art and rare everyday objects that, arranged chronologically, represent the evolution of life and history in the Greek peninsula from prehistory to the 20th century. While these museums display artefacts from different eras and communities, they fail to shed light on gender issues and to tell inclusive stories. Even though many of the objects within their permanent collections belonged to women, were made by or for women, and depict women, very little is said of their lives and social roles within their respective societies. This paper examines how and whether the four aforementioned museums tell stories of women by examining different elements within their exhibitions (objects, thematic sections, texts, images, etc.), then suggesting new, feminist perspectives and approaches for considering them. By drawing attention to history's overlooked women and celebrating their lives, we suggest how treasuries of Greek civilisation might also become sites of social inclusion, diversity, and equity.","Margari, Eleni",,

She demonstrates that choosing to focus your research on what bothers you most about planning thought and practice often results in powerful and widely read results and cites cases where advocacy research and outreach, including writing for multiple audiences, has produced positive change.

SAR is a bridge 'from' cis-hetero-monogamous-ableist kyriarchy and other forms of erotic marginalization 'to' embodiment, loving kindness, compassion, compersion, and equanimity. Stop the perpetuation of sexual shame, stigma, and other harms through meta-cognition, increased sexual world-view, professional boundaries, and triadic professional relationships for compassionate client support and equity formation. Analysis of SAR lesson plans from multiple leaders in the field, to compare and critique methods and pedagogy utilized.Literature review of books, dissertations, and peer-reviewed journal publications on SAR.Professional recommendations based upon research and analysis. SAR is an opportunity for each participant to recognize and critically examine our internalized shame, stigma, aversion, and joy. Through this process of collaborative reflection, dialogue, and meta-cognition; we can learn to address the hidden narratives that might guide and/or foreclose our potential personal lives and to minimize harmful perpetuation of shame and stigma to clients, colleagues, family, and community. Physician, first heal thyself!It is important to understand that while as SAR is a required course for AASECT certification; it is the potential first of many experiential steps along the path of personal and professional exploration that will unfold across one's lifespan. SAR is a critical examination of one's sexual beliefs and values. A way of challenging the world as we know it to exist by purposefully confronting different worldviews, cultures, abilities, sexual orientations, gender identities, socioeconomic status, and social histories via lived experiences. SAR is also a nurturing space that encourages the growing process and facilitates brave learning.

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2022,6,Challenges in Assessing Improvements in Delivery of Palliative Care Within and Across Programs (GP743).,"1. Understand the variation and approach different healthcare systems use in identifying seriously ill patients 2. Understand palliative care measures that were comparable and the extent of palliative care data some organization have that could be used as a goal for others Research and quality improvement efforts depend on reliable, accessible data. Compare data across seven hospital systems to assess consistency in data points that would make research across all centers possible. Collection of routine data from the electronic medical record (EMRs) of seriously ill patients. Identification of a common denominator for defining the seriously ill population across all seven hospital systems was not possible due to different definitions of seriously ill in practice, lack of data analytic resources to apply a common definition to existing EMRs, and difficulty accessing historical data. Data available consistently across all seven hospital systems were limited due to differences in data collection, management, and analytic capacity for existing and planned program expansions. The biggest barrier to accessing data that existed was lack of resources to pull data in a timely way. Additionally, the process of negotiating data use agreements for sharing of nonidentifiable protected health information–free data was extremely onerous, delaying access by as much as 1 year at several sites. Despite common EMRs, wide variations in the capture and availability of data for assessing the implementation and effectiveness of interventions targeting seriously ill patients across systems exist. Efforts to share successes in data infrastructure, management, and reporting across healthcare systems, in particular with lesser-resourced community and regional organizations, could contribute meaningfully to improving provision of equitable palliative care. Well-meaning laws (i.e., HIPAA) tend to be applied in an overly restrictive manner that prohibits, or at least creates significant barriers to, valuable collaborations and partnerships intended to improve care. Lack of common data across systems, poor resources dedicated to data analytics, and overly restrictive application of laws make comparison of the impact of new and existing palliative care programs difficult. Such variability will also pose a challenge for future attempts to consistently assess and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.","Winget, Marcy","Holdsworth, Laura",Stanford University School of Medicine

The strengthening momentum of alternate entry and enabling schemes within the context of equity and diversity in higher education is illuminated, highlighting the need for innovative approaches in this sector. Such a perspective invites the international education community to reframe how they approach attainment, admissions and success, shifting from a traditional focus on high-stakes, single-mark assessment, to a rich, layered and contextualised representation of a student's skills and, through this, revealing the often invisible potential of a student. This is timely within the global context of future-focused tertiary education and debate surrounding admissions processes across the Australian higher education sector.

Physical Education & Sport Pedagogy,2020,5,"Time to SHAPE Up: developing policies, standards and practices that are socially just.","Background: The Society for Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE) America has guided physical education curriculum, instruction, and assessment in the United States (US) for well over 100 years. We contend that in the US context for physical education, the National Standards and Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education (Society of Health and Physical Educators America. 2014. National Standards and Grade-level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics) and the Initial Physical Education Teacher Education Standards (Society of Health and Physical Educators America. 2017. 2017 National Standards for Initial Physical Education Teacher Education. Reston, VA: Author) are policy documents that strongly influence curriculum in physical education. While there has been forward movement in identifying and addressing diverse learning needs across these standards, we argue that a more explicit and overt focus on social justice education (SJE) is needed. Specifically, the SHAPE America standards need to be challenged and revised to become more equitable and socially just to meet the needs of all of our students, both at the higher education and K-12 levels. Purpose: We explore each standard and grade-level outcome in the standards to identify how social justice is currently being considered and expose the paucity of explicit and intentional focus on SJE. In this study, we draw on policy reform and network theory (Penney, D. 2016. ""Policy and Possibilities."" In Routledge Handbook of Physical Education Pedagogies, edited by C. Ennis, 131–142. New York: Routledge; Ball, S. J. 2007. Education Plc. Understanding Private Sector Participation in Public Sector Education. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge; 2015. ""What is Policy? 21 Years Later: Reflections on the Possibilities of Policy Research."" Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education 36 (2): 306–313) as frameworks for theorizing the data. Data collection and analysis: We utilized a document analysis qualitative research method to examine and evaluate how SJE is represented in the standards. The intent of document analysis is to examine and interpret data in order to elicit meaning, gain understanding, and develop empirical knowledge. Our process involved a 3-stage process, which included a superficial examination (skimming), thorough examination (reading), and concluded with an interpretation of our analysis. We utilized this process for the current and previous editions of the K-12 and PETE standards. Findings: Across the Initial PETE Standards (Society of Health and Physical Educators America. 2017. 2017 National Standards for Initial Physical Education Teacher Education. Reston, VA: Author) and the National Standards and Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education (Society of Health and Physical Educators America. 2014. National Standards and Grade-level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.) there was limited intentional and explicit emphasis on social justice, diversity, equity and inclusion in the current editions. This was consistent across previous editions in both sets of standards; however, there was more of an overt and intentional focus on SJE in the initial standards developed in 1995. 25 years ago, the K-12 national standards and student expectations had greater emphasis on SJE than we do today.","Walton-Fisette, Jennifer L.","Sutherland, Sue","Teaching, Learning and Curriculum Studies, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA"

Opportunities to increase diversity are membership in surgical societies and leadership development. We hypothesized that surgical society meetings represent additional opportunities, using gender diversity as an example.<bold>Methods: </bold>Published programs from annual meetings of three large surgical societies were reviewed. Participants' gender was classified by first name. Online search was used for equivocal names. We used JMP Pro 14.1.0 for univariate and multivariate logistic regression.<bold>Results: </bold>During six meetings (2016-2018), 415 sessions with 4078 participants were included, 61% educational panels with invited faculty and 39% abstract sessions. Across all meetings, 32% of abstracts were presented by women, 22% of panel chairs or invited faculty were women. Fifty-four percent of male meeting participants were invited by their societies as moderator or speaker, and 41% of female participants were invited faculty. Fifty-nine percent of all panel chairs had no woman participant. In both univariate and multivariate regression, women had more than threefold the odds of presenting an abstract than presenting on a panel (p < 0.0001).

Now, executives at companies such as Twitter and Walt Disney Co. are saying it is time for employees to return to the workplace. But many employees balk at coming back after almost three years of flexibility. Surveys have found that a majority of employees who can work remotely want to keep a remote or hybrid schedule, and some say they will quit if forced to return to the office full time. Many say remote and hybrid work have improved diversity, equity and inclusion as employers are able to attract a wider range of talent from across the country. More disabled people have entered the workforce, and members of marginalized groups report facing fewer negative situations at work. But others say hybrid work threatens corporate culture, hampers workplace relationships and undermines company loyalty.

Compare and contrast the Project ECHO model with other forms of education, mentoring, and support for practitioners in our field 2. Assess practice needs and gaps in your organization or in our field and develop interdisciplinary techniques and curricula to address those concerns As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic we created and executed an 18-month nationwide, interdisciplinary, virtual meeting project for hospice and palliative medicine team members. Through team expertise and collaboration, experience with the use of Project ECHO, and close monitoring of the impact the pandemic was disproportionately having on underserved communities and communities of color, we decided upon our focus areas for the project. We chose areas we thought were critical to the overall support of providers, patients, and our larger hospice and palliative medicine community. Areas to be addressed included knowledge gaps in treating people with COVID-19; advanced communication skillset needs with the rapid pivot to telehealth; and equity, diversity, inclusion, and racism in our field. Additionally, we wanted to build in techniques and methods we could use to foster strong interdisciplinary interactions toward building resilience and community in the face of the many unknowns of treating patients and caring for ourselves through the pandemic. We chose the model offered by Project ECHO, at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, as the structure upon which we would build our project and to meet our objectives. The ECHO model uses virtual gathering to support mentorship, welcomes all levels of training with an ""all teach, all learn"" focus, and offers patient case–based learning in a way so as to democratize specialty knowledge. The virtual setting allows for participation regardless of location. We have gathered post-session survey data, participant data on moral distress, and data on provider views of their ability to affect equity, diversity, inclusion, and racism in our field. Our project is ongoing. Presenters are members of our project's interdisciplinary expert team, including MDs, an MSW/LCSW, a PharmD, and a PhD palliative care researcher.

In addition, this rapid review aimed to identify the strategies used during prior infectious disease threats, when similar blanket visitor restrictions were implemented in LTC homes. The review was part of a larger effort to support LTC homes in Ontario. A rapid review was conducted in accordance with principles from the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools. ECs, residents, staff, and policy decision makers in long-term care home settings. Five electronic databases were searched for academic and gray literature using predefined search terms. Selected documents met inclusion criteria if they included policy guidance or an intervention to (re)integrate ECs into LTC homes at the local, national, and/or international level. In total, 15 documents met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All documents retrieved focused on the context of COVID-19. Documents were either policy guidance (n = 13) or primary research studies (n = 2). Documents differed in these notable ways: Definition of EC; the degree to which an EC is recognized for her or his role in the care of the resident; the degree to which ECs are (re)integrated into the LTC setting is prioritized; response to community spread of COVID-19; visitation during an outbreak or if a resident is symptomatic; the reliance on equity, diversity, and inclusion principles; and lastly, monitoring and improving the process. Using an equity, diversity, and inclusion lens, we posit promising practices for (re)integration. It is clear from the rapid review that more research is needed to understand the efficacy of policies and guidelines to (re)integrate ECs into the LTC setting. Until such evidence is available, expert opinion will drive best care practices.","Palubiski, Lisa M.","Tulsieram, Kurt L.","McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"

This narrative collection offers diverse female perspective on the impact of surgical training and practice, yet common themes emerge related to gender in the field of surgery. This symposium provides insight on surgical culture and traditions that are detrimental to surgeons in general, and woman surgeons in particular. It addresses how leadership and institutional changes must be made to equitably and successfully recruit, support, promote, and retain women training and practicing surgery. There is hope for the future of gender equity, diversity, and inclusion in the surgical workforce but only if its leaders adopt a zero tolerance policy against the range of gender-disparities identified and prioritize a culture of safety, dignity and equity.","Miller, Pringl",,"Departments of Surgery and Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.

This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews and focus groups with 502 participants across the United States to examine when and why college student political behaviors influence institutional changes on college campuses. Findings from this study suggest that higher education institutions present different political opportunity structures for students to engage in activism. These political opportunity structures provide policy windows at the institutional level to affect campus wide change. To the extent that these changes promote diversity, equity, and inclusion though also depends on these varying structures. In this paper, a typology of these structures is presented to explain when student activism shapes institutional change and for whom.","Teresa Brower, Margaret","Kyle Upchurch, J.","Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"
Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings,2022,9,An Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) Framework for Teaching Cultural Humility: A Guide for Translating ACT from a Therapeutic Context into a Medical Education Curriculum.,"The objective of this project was to train future physicians to work effectively and thoughtfully with diverse populations by teaching them to employ Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) skills to increase cultural humility, with the goal of improving attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about working with diverse patients. We developed ACT for cultural humility online interactive modules as part of an elective course to teach Medical Spanish to 4th-year medical students. Pre- and post-pilot data pertaining to the cultural humility training modules on the Work-Related Acceptance and Action questionnaire, Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were analyzed using paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We also included descriptive data pertaining to overall satisfaction with the cultural humility modules and intent to apply the material learned to patient care. Our data showed a significant increase in the cultural humility of our participants as well as an increase in psychological flexibility, a higher favorability rating toward various ethnicities, improvements in attitude, and positive changes in beliefs and knowledge following completion of the modules. The modules were well received by the medical students, with high social validity ratings. The ACT for cultural humility curriculum has great potential to enhance medical education in diversity, equity, and inclusion by increasing both the understanding and the cultural humility of medical students and future professionals to work with diverse populations. The current paper provides a framework that can be used by other programs to shape the education of the future medical workforce to help promote culturally humble care.","Lombardero, Anayansi","Assemi, Kian S.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine"

Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition,2019,1,Infrastructure Sinkholes: The Pretense of Operating Gender Neutral Organizations Erodes Engineering Education.,"This paper draws from the framework of Feminist Scholar Joan Acker's Gendered Organizations (1990; 2012) to examine the shifting landscape of engineering education and related networks. Analysis of interviews with over 30 engineering education researchers reveals organizational dynamics and gendered relations present in both day-to-day work environments and engineering education reform efforts. National conversations with professional societies, industry representatives, and federal agencies seek to articulate public values to which engineering education should respond, and seek to drive change through funding mechanisms, bully pulpits, accreditation, and governance of the profession itself. Examining these directives through a feminist lens reveals possible limitations of what is currently imagined as an ideal for which the field strives, and whose concerns are addressed and presented. Grounding in feminist theory helps to work a basis that organizations can be and are cultural - a notion many organizational scholars note as an integral force for understanding change (Schein, 1990). It provides the researchers and the research itself the ability to be reflexive while paying critical attention with regard to gender and other oppressive intersections as they arise in analysis. As organizational dynamics unfold layers of written and unwritten regulations eroding the engineering education profession, which scaffold gender neutral engineering practices, power is enacted and must not only be acknowledged but addressed. These power relations within organizations influence all aspects of change potential in engineering education and are not limited to change related to diversity, equity, or inclusion. Through attending to these aspects of organizations, we can focus on understanding how to shift power dynamics to enact change at various levels.","Quiles-Ramos, Stephanie","Foster, Ellen K.",Gradaute Research Assistant at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University

Journal of Engineering Education,2023,4,"Impact of COVID‐19 on sense of belonging: Experiences of engineering students, faculty, and staff at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).","Background: COVID‐19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Purpose/Hypothesis: Given the pressing need demonstrated by the National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID‐19 impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty, and staff at HBCUs? Design/Methods: Three surveys were developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach. Results: Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79% agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders' surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall levels of stress and anxiety. Conclusions: During a global pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence. Due to the well‐documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic, the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward broadening participation in engineering for students should be further explored.","Fletcher, Trina L.","Jefferson, Jay P.","School of Universal Computing, Construction and Engineering Education (SUCCEED), STEM Transformation Institute and STEM READi Lab at Florida International University, Miami Florida,, USA"

A diverse array of neurosurgical techniques, treatments, and new areas of study have emerged within the field. Meanwhile, the neurosurgical workforce has stayed demographically homogeneous throughout time. Certain groups remain underrepresented owing to systemic barriers based on social identities and categorizations, including gender, race, ability status, and others. In this article, we highlight some of the underrepresented groups in neurosurgery and chronicle the important contributions and achievements that individuals from these groups have made in the field despite structural barriers and discrimination. We present evidence from the basic sciences, economics, business, and other disciplines that illustrate that diversity is not only just but also the most rational pursuit for positive growth and advancement. Diversity is needed to enrich the specialty and augment its capacity to serve the heterogeneous population of patients that reflect our society. To promote equity and diversity in the field, ongoing deliberate, organized, and systematic efforts to change the status quo and make the field more inclusive are needed.","Kim, Eliana E.","Klein, Andrea L.","Gender Equity Initiative in Global Surgery, Boston, Massachusetts, USA"

Teaching & Learning in Medicine,2022,10,Build & Belong: A Peer-Based Intervention to Reduce Medical Student Social Isolation.,"Medical school can be a socially isolating experience, particularly for students underrepresented in medicine. Social isolation and perceptions of not belonging can negatively impact students' academic performance and well-being. Therefore, interventions are needed to support students and these efforts should be appealing, brief, and low-burden. Guided by evidence-based approaches, we developed the Build & Belong intervention for medical students as a brief peer-to-peer approach that consisted of four components. First, M3 and M4 students wrote reflections on belonging in medical school. Second, M3 and M4 students video recorded messages for M1 and M2 students using their written reflections. Third, M1 and M2 students watched and discussed the videos in small groups. Fourth, the M1 and M2 students wrote letters to future students. Our intervention differs from previous student belonging interventions in the peer delivery of messages. The Build & Belong intervention aimed to improve medical students' social belongingness. Using a longitudinal observational study design, the intervention was piloted at a medical school in the Mid-Atlantic United States in 2017-2018. Students completed surveys before and after the intervention. Paired samples tests (t-tests and Wilcoxon) assessed pre- to post-intervention changes in social isolation, social connectedness, and social assurance. Among 63 medical students, with 25.9% from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, we assessed follow-up outcomes in 38 students. Social isolation scores significantly decreased from baseline (M = 54.8, SD = 7.06) to follow-up (M = 51.3, SD = 6.67; p <.001). Social isolation changes were evident regardless of sex, although males reported a greater reduction (M Δ = −5.32, p <.001) than females (M Δ = −2.79, p =.014). Black/African American students had the largest reduction in social isolation (M Δ = −7.24, p =.010). Social assurance and connectedness scores did not change significantly between baseline and follow-up. Medical students appeared to resonate with messages delivered by more experienced peers (M3s and M4s), particularly messages that normalized feelings of not belonging and strategies to reduce those feelings. The Build & Belong intervention appears to reduce social isolation scores among medical students. This pilot test of the Build & Belong intervention provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of a brief, low-cost intervention. Build & Belong may provide a scalable strategy to reduce medical students' social isolation. Our peer-based approach is distinct from administrator-led strategies; peers were seen as trusted and reliable sources of information about belonging and ways to overcome the challenges experienced during medical school.","Cheng, Susan M.","Taylor, David L.","Department of Family Medicine and Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA"

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2022,5,Breaking Down Barriers: Creating a Virtual Hospice and Palliative Care Didactic Series (QI424).,"1. Examine systemic barriers to collaboration with hospice and palliative care specialists from other institutions 2. Appraise the feasibility of interprogram collaboration for your institution The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed multiple aspects of the provision of high-quality hospice and palliative care (HAPC) education. Social distancing, physical space constraints, and demands on providers limited the provision of didactic activities in small HAPC training programs. Now, meeting via video conferencing has become a normal activity, and there are very few barriers to expanding didactic activities beyond the walls of a single institution. We will increase access to a free, virtual, open-access program that supplements HAPC education for trainees and practicing providers and members of the interdisciplinary team. After recognizing the need for expansion of didactics, the authors used social media to request lecturers from different programs and create a sustainable didactic series. Within days the first 6 months of lecture spots were filled.

Journal of Pain & Symptom Management,2022,5,"Not Always Black and White: Examining Hospice Acceptance Among White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic Patients After Palliative Care Consultations.","1. Explain how diversity, equity, and inclusion and cultural factors may affect preferences about hospice selection and acceptance 2. Apply cultural knowledge and humility skills to specific patient populations yet not stereotype Racial and ethnic differences exist regarding hospice preferences and utilization near end of life (EOL). Previous literature shows that Whites are more likely to use hospice services, whereas Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients are less likely. Barriers such as language, health literacy, and cultural, spiritual, and religious values may explain these disparities between racial and ethnic groups. To examine the rates of hospice acceptance among White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black patients after inpatient palliative care consultation (PCC). To compare differences and similarities between racial and ethnic groups regarding hospice decisions. Retrospective study conducted at a community teaching hospital in Queens, New York, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States. Subjects received PCC from 2014 to 2019 and included White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black patients. To minimize language barriers, medical interpreting services were used as appropriate. We measured hospice acceptance after PCC and factors associated with hospice discharge. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze data. Of the total 5,563 subjects, 2,138 (38.4%) were White, 1,689 (30.4%) Asian, 1,008 (18.1%) Black, and 728 (13.1%) Hispanic. In terms of disposition upon discharge, 1,541 (28%) patients were discharged to hospice, 1,391 (25%) died during hospitalization, and 2,631(47%) were discharged to other settings. Among subjects who had a hospice discharge, the racial and ethnic distribution was White 29%, Asian 28%, Hispanic 27%, and Black 26%. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for the interactions and effects of age, gender, and ethnicity. The final adjusted model revealed that the older age group (≥85 years old) was significantly more likely to choose hospice compared to ≤65-year-old group (p < 0.001), after we controlled for gender and ethnicity. Our findings show that among subjects who received PCC, the hospice discharge rate ranged between 26% to 29% across all racial and ethnic groups. Older age (≥85 years) was associated with higher hospice discharge regardless of gender and ethnicity. PCC may be associated with reducing care disparities by ensuring more equitable hospice access.","Pan, Cynthia","Palathra, Brigit",NewYork–Presbyterian Queens
Journal of Animal Science,2022,4,71 Infusing Animal Science Curricula with Cultural Intelligence.,"Increasingly, universities across the United States are expecting their undergraduate programs to meet, not only, discipline-specific, knowledge content learning outcomes, but also, soft skills and general education objectives, as well. It is not unusual today that outcomes about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are found in either or both program-level and general education learning objectives, including capstone courses. Cultural intelligence is an effective approach to accomplish DEI goals. The purpose of the presentation is two-fold: (1) to discuss the empirical evidence about increasing cultural intelligence in academic programs outside of animal science and (2) the transference of that work into animal science. Curricula to foster cultural intelligence among students includes focusing on deep cultural awareness (implicit biases, privileges and prejudices), diversity education (guest speakers, textbooks, documentaries), and high-impact educational experiences. One of the best strategies is ensuring that all courses are taught by culturally intelligent educators. Increasing a single aspect of cultural intelligence, particularly cultural awareness, improves the environment for students from underrepresented populations which leads to better retention and graduation rates. Five teaching modules with multiple lessons within each, were developed, based on a five-level, progressive model of cultural intelligence, beginning with cultural awareness and ending with cultural proficiency, to infuse into animal science curricula. The first module comprises a basic understanding of cultural concepts and recognizing cultural implications of behavior. The second module comprises elements of culture and their impact on human behavior, including animal care. The third module comprises an integration of cultural knowledge. The fourth module involves social and economic contexts. The fifth module involves negotiating across culture and an intrinsic desire for inclusivity. The presentation will be interactive: the lessons will be demonstrated; assessments developed shared; and the faculty and graduate teaching assistant training sessions experienced. Today's employment-ready graduates must be culturally intelligent to be able to think critically and solve complex problems in an increasingly diverse and global workplace.","Garrison, M E Betsy","Daniel, Annie",University of Arkansas

The State of Utah, is vast, but sparsely populated outside the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. More than 96% of our nearly 85,000 square miles is designated rural (<100 people/square mile) or frontier (<7 people/square mile). The Salt Lake City area is home to the Hunsman Cancer Institute, the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the region, also noted the limited diversity in the biomedical cancer research workforce. Our primary objective was to increase the number of underrepresented trainees who pursue higher education with the goal of a career in cancer research. PathMaker is a regional, competitive pipeline program that nurtures high school or undergraduate trainees from historically underrepresented backgrounds towards a career in cancer research. Our faculty and staff team collaboratively developed a cohort model curriculum that increased student awareness of research career options; provided academic and professional development, cultural and social support, evolutionary success strategies, active mentorship, and leadership skill development; and fostered an environment of continuous evaluation and improvement. Since pilot program initiation in May 2016, the PathMaker Research Program (PathMaker) has engaged a total of 44 underrepresented trainees in cancer research labs at Huntsman Cancer Institute, the majority still in college. Eleven trainees graduated college: five employed in STEM, one pursuing a PhD in STEM; two in medical school, and three are lost to follow-up. Alumni report high levels of satisfaction with PathMaker and will be followed and supported for academic success. PathMaker is a replicable model to increase diversity and inclusion in the biomedical cancer research workforce.","López, Ana María","Rodríguez, José E","Professor and Vice Chair of Medical Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadephia, PA, USA"

Encouraging respectful discourse on campus presented itself as a wicked problem at [institution name removed for the purposes of blind review] when, at the Martin Luther King, Jr. unity march in January 2018, several bystanders hurled racial epithets at the march's participants. In response, the Faculty Senate resolved that the university's Liberal Studies (general education) program create an Inclusive Excellence course requirement for students, with specific emphases on diversity, inclusion, equity, empathy, multicultural understanding, and civil discourse. The intent behind this request stressed the need to strengthen democratic norms by helping students develop stronger civic engagement skills for serving diverse communities. To that end, this article employs a case study approach in examining the efforts of the Liberal Studies program to create an Inclusive Excellence course requirement within its general education curriculum. The attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, but the process underlying the attempt suggested that considerations of scale and unanticipated consequences, clearly defined terms, and the articulation of a cohesive vision for student learning are centrally important to the effective resolution of a curricular wicked problem.","SCHIFF, JENNIFER","BURTON, CAROL","Associate professor of Political Science and Public Affairs at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, NC."

Teachers College Record,2018,12,Hidden in Plain Sight: The Black Women's Blueprint for Institutional Transformation in Higher Education.,"Many institutional leaders find themselves struggling to achieve racial equity in a sociopolitical context where hatemongering, misogyny, xenophobia, heterosexism, and racism have been normalized and minoritized students, staff, and faculty have been relegated to the margins. Few institutional leaders (e.g., presidents, provosts, chancellors, boards of trustees, deans) understand how, why, and the extent to which minoritized peoples are affected by multiple and overlapping forms of oppression. As a result, institutional change efforts to transform campuses into identity-affirming and socially just learning environments often prove ineffective because college and university leaders typically engage in single-axis identity politics to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. In this article, the authors challenge institutional leaders to take up intersectionality as a method of engaging in lasting transformational change that promises to advance racial equity in higher education. The authors also expose the limitations of existing institutional change models by highlighting their intersectional failures and prompt readers to imagine Black women as possibility models for institutional change that transforms higher education and advances racial equity.","PATTON, LORI D.","HAYNES, CHAYLA",Indiana University

Clinical Imaging,2022,1,"Judging film, not skin: can radiologists combat bias in medicine?","From the more than 700,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the US and the nearly 5 million worldwide, there emerge even more stories than match the statistics when one considers all of the patients' relations. While the numbers are staggering, when we humanize the stories, we are left with even greater devastation, of course. One of the stories among so many that seemed particularly salient and poignant to us was the death of Dr. Susan Moore. Her plaintive Facebook post, which went viral in December 2020, was made a few weeks before she died at the age of 52 from COVID-19 and claimed that she was a victim of racially biased treatment at a hospital in Indiana. It was Dr. Moore's mentioning of CT scans that led us to reflect on the biases of some health care workers and the role of radiologists. Our initial interface with our patients is actually not with their faces, but with their films. This dynamic does not eliminate any biases we may harbor but shields practitioners and patients from potential glaring racial biases in this first and sometimes only stage of the relationship. • Implicit biases can affect health outcomes. Radiologists' initial interface with patients is with their films, not faces. • Radiologists can call for the elimination of implicit bias in their journal submissions, lectures, and other communications. • Diversity, inclusion, equity, cultural competence, and anti-bias training should be required for all medical personnel.","Weisberg, Edmund M.","Fishman, Elliot K.","Johns Hopkins University Russell H.

Canadian Theatre Review,2021,7,"""Room for Failure Was Abundant"".","The SummerWorks Festival has provided the author with opportunities to move toward a theatre practice in which a non-hierarchical approach allows for accountable collaborations across difference alongside rigorous artistic experimentation. In this piece, the author analyzes experiences in a number of SummerWorks Festival productions between 2006 and 2017, weaving in the perspectives of a number of collaborating artists, tracing a development from a personal desire for community, through the facilitation of staging others' stories, toward a desire to speak to one's own culpabilities regarding the inequities of our society. This personal article parallels both reckonings in Canadian theatre around artistic accountability and ongoing conversations regarding responsible collaboration. The SummerWorks productions examined are You Like It.

European Journal of Public Health,2021,10,Othering in public health using the example of Covid-19 management in German asylum camps.,"Issue/problem: In 2020, several German reception centers and asylum camps were imposed mass quarantine after single residents had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Civil and research networks criticized this measure, as crowded housing conditions limited the implementation of infection protection measures, and mass quarantine further increased the risk of infection. This raised the question why public health (PH) measures in these settings differed from those implemented in the general population, and which implications for future PH approaches can be identified. Problem description: Considering the epidemiological evidence and ethical perspectives on the PH strategies described above, we applied the concepts of ‘‘Exclusionary Othering’’ and ‘‘Inclusionary Othering’’ to PH. We further discussed the Covid-19 management in German reception centers and asylum camps. Results: We identified three conceptual approaches: 1) exclusionary, 2) inclusionary, and 3) diversity-sensitive approaches to PH. Exclusionary PH is characterized by an exclusion of less powerful groups despite negative health consequences. Inclusive approaches seek to empower less powerful groups in order to understand each other’s needs, build cooperations, protect everyone and to prevent the development of ‘‘hot spots’’. Diversity-sensitive PH approaches avoid othering and seek to implement measures for everyone, taking into account diverse needs, conditions, and resources. Lessons: We propose a paradigm shift towards inclusionary and diversity-sensitive PH that benefits the entire population, including those forced to flee other countries. This requires a critical reflection of power dynamics and discrimination. The proposed concepts can be transferred to other social groups, regions, and areas of PH. Key messages: • Public health needs to shift its perspective from exclusion and subordination to inclusion and involvement. • Inclusionary and diversity-sensitive PH approaches promote health equity.","Tallarek, M.","Spallek, J.","Department of Public Health, Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg, Senftenberg, Germany."

This article examines how six Canadian municipalities have adapted their parks, recreation and culture strategic plans, policies, programs and services in response to international migration and racial diversity. The analysis of official documents and interviews with municipal officials and community representatives reveals that municipalities have adopted de facto multicultural planning practices aligned with the state paradigm of immigrant integration and national identity, even when the term “multiculturalism” is rarely employed in official discourse. They have also incorporated some aspects of mainstreaming into the planning repertoire. In Canada, mainstreaming is not an alternative to group-specific programing, but an additional mechanism for the recognition of difference in public institutions.","Tossutti, Livianna",,"Political Science, 7497 Brock University , St Catharines, Ontario, Canada"

Apply cultural knowledge and humility skills to specific patient populations yet not stereotype Racialand ethnic differences exist regarding code status preferences and aggressive interventions near end of life (EOL). Previous literature shows that Whites are most likely have established advance directives, and Blacks are least likely to have advance directives and most likely to opt for aggressive EOL treatments. Among the Hispanic and Asian populations, studies show mixed results regarding EOL preferences. Barriers such as language, health literacy, and cultural, spiritual, and religious values may explain these disparities between races. To examine the association between palliative care consultation (PCC) and code status changes among White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black patients. To compare differences and similarities between racial and ethnic groups regarding code status preferences. Retrospectivestudy conducted at a community teaching hospital in Queens, NY, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States. Subjects received PCC from 2014-2019 and included White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black patients. To minimize language barriers, medical interpreting services were used as appropriate. Outcomes measured were code status changes pre/post PCC. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze data. Of the 5,563 subjects, 2,138 (38%) were White, 1,689 (30%) Asian, 1,008 (18%) Black, and 728 (13%) Hispanic. After PCC, 4,119 (74%) patients chose DNR, a 30% increase from baseline (95% CI, 29%-32%, p < 0.001). All groups had an increase in DNR status: Whites increased from 51% to 79%, Asians from 44% to 75%, Hispanics 38% to 72%, and Blacks 33% to 64% (p < 0.001 for each group). This study includes a large sample of minority subjects, especially Asians and Hispanics. We found that all racial and ethnic groups had a statistically significant increase in code status conversion after PCC. PCC may be associated with reducing disparities of care between ethnicities by promoting culturally appropriate code status discussions.","Pan, Cynthia","Palathra, Brigit",NewYork-Presbyterian Queens

International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference on Social Sciences & Arts SGEM,2015,1,GATED COMMUNITIES AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY: A CASE STUDY OF ANKARA.,"There have to date been many researches focusing on social sustainability; although there are only a limited number examining the relationship between social sustainability and gated communities. In this study, a case study is made of Ankara (the capital city of Turkey) analyzing the rapid increase in the number of gated communities in the city. These communities promise residents a comfortable lifestyle with strictly controlled entrances; however the social and physical barriers that are formed between the residents within and outside such communities raise the question of whether gated communities have become a threat to social sustainability. Much of the existing research of social sustainability emphasizes such concepts as safety, social equity, social inclusion, diversity, environmentally sensitive, etc., and with this in mind, this paper takes a critical look at recently built gated communities in Ankara, focusing in particular on four factors (housing affordability and quality; social and environmental equity; social inclusion and integration; and safety/security) derived from the literature review. The intention in this regard is to examine the relationship between gated communities and social sustainability. The results of the study revealed significant evidence that gated communities violated some key concepts of social sustainability in Ankara.","Alkan, Leyla",,"Gazi University, Department of City and Regional Planning, Turkey"

Consistent with previous research, bivariate and multivariate OLS regression models show that frequent religious attenders have statistically significantly better self-rated health. However, this relationship is moderated by social ties. Respondents who scored lower on the social ties index exhibited a stronger significant relationship between frequent religious attendance and health; those scoring higher on the social ties index exhibited no relationship between frequent attendance and health. Future research should examine how benefits of religious attendance vary depending upon strength of social relationships.","Cupery, Tim","Bush, Evelyn","Department of Sociology, College of Social Sciences, California State University - Fresno, 534 N.

Leader to Leader,2020,1,INVITING NEW PERSPECTIVES FOR DIVERSITY BEYOND LIP SERVICE.,"As a coach specializing in DEIB (diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging) with decades of experience in corporate organizations, I understand the pervasive and limiting effects of less-than-optimal diversity and inclusion practices - what I call D&I lip service. An international textile company recently conducted an employee-engagement survey with questions surrounding employee culture, leadership, and professional development. He took a deep dive into the employee-engagement survey findings, curious about what the insights meant for the organization and its talent, and about what steps they could take to improve. Moreover, the engagement generated by the survey - and Eddie's openness to new perspectives - led to increased productivity and performance for the organization as a whole.","Harris, La'Wana",,

Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,2022,1,"Safe here, but unsafe there? Institutional signals of identity safety also signal prejudice in the broader environment.","Institutional efforts to create safe environments can function as signals to identity safety and reduce expectations of identity threat within the institution. Prior research on institutional identity safety signals, however, has yet to consider an important question: Do people use institutional identity safety signals to inform their expectations of identity threat in their broader social environments? Because people's day-to-day lives are often outside of signaling institutions, it is important to understand whether institutional identity safety signals also influence expectations of identity threat outside of the signaled space. Here, we explore this question by testing how the presence of safe spaces— designated areas where people can feel comfortable in their social identities and safe from prejudice—affect people's expectations of threat in their broader environments. Across four vignette-based studies using US participants sampled from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and an undergraduate subject pool, participants who read about someone observing a safe space sign (compared to signs unrelated to identity safety) reported increased prejudice expectations in their broader environments. These prejudice expectations mediated increased attributions of prejudice (Study 1); motivations to combat prejudice (Study 2); and support for movements and policies addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion (Study 3). These effects were not moderated by group membership. Results suggested that safe spaces increased prejudice expectations because they are perceived as a response to a problem in the broader environment. Together, the present research contributes to existing literature by testing the effects of a new signal (i.e., safe spaces), examining how localized identity safety signals transfer to the broader environment, and highlighting novel outcomes following from prejudice expectations.","Gainsburg, Izzy","Earl, Allison","University of Michigan, Department of Psychology, United States of America"

Canadian Music Educator / Musicien Educateur au Canada,2023,3,Reconciling Truth -- Our Stories to Tell and Our Songs to Sing.,"Indigenous worldview is grounded in the fact that cultural knowledge is based on lived experience. Culture is not something learned academically; it is not knowledge that can be obtained through observation and shared through reporting. It is a shared experience fostered across the development of our cultural identity. Spirituality and ancestral knowledge are at the center of Indigenous views regarding story and song; thus, using these methods to transmit knowledge requires great care rooted in familiarity. These are reinforced by a communal worldview that considers the importance of truth and the grave effects second-hand information can have on the community. This view is acknowledged, but more needs to be done in terms of action to allow the proper representation of these perspectives in all forms of education. The high level of importance in the underpinnings of truth and spirituality in both Indigenous stories and songs defines a need for a new educational system, one requiring a balanced method that raises Indigenous knowledge keepers to the same level of recognition presently dominating education and academic discourse.","Young, J.

European Journal of Public Health,2021,10,5.M. Skills building seminar: How to integrate social identities in public health education – an intersectional approach.,"Members of minoritized population groups are exposed to higher burdens of morbidity and mortality and face barriers to accessing health care systems and other critical resources to achieve optimal health. Intersectional perspectives that emphasize the dimensions of social power and discrimination are just beginning to emerge in public health research. These perspectives contextualize longstanding patterns of health inequalities but are rarely translated into public health curriculum. Concepts like ‘‘cultural competence’’ or ‘‘diversity, equity and inclusion’’ do address the importance of awareness and respect for (cultural) diversity in (patient/client) populations. The research and teaching examples available are largely limited to a USA context, tend to consider specific identities, rather than intersectional characteristics, are not systematically integrated in public health curricula and are usually not rooted in a theoretical approach of teaching. It is imperative that Europe bridges the knowledge-to-teaching gap and begins introducing similar programs, while learning from the limitations of USA efforts. Two steps are needed to strengthen public health educational institutions and improve population health: first, to systematically incorporate an intersectional paradigm into public health curricula; and second, to provide faculty members in public health programs with transformative teaching skills. In this skills building seminar, we aim to 1) discuss the need for incorporating intersectionality into public health curricula in Europe; 2) provide an experiential learning opportunity on social identities and health; and 3) create a space for self-reflection. We first present the introductory course on social identities and their importance in public health (Wandschneider et al.) which has been developed in collaboration with the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) (15 minutes). Secondly, we will have an interactive session to apply an exemplary teaching method (25 minutes). To conclude, we will moderate a discussion guided by the questions ‘‘What is needed to integrate such efforts more sustainably in public health teaching practices?’’ and ‘‘How do we address potential barriers?’’ (20 minutes). This workshop addresses persons who engage in teaching in undergraduate or graduate Public Health programs or provide training to public health and health care professionals. It also invites researchers to reflect on how to frame research on health inequalities. Key messages: To address health inequities, we need to incorporate an intersectional paradigm into public health curricula and provide faculty members in public health programs with transformative teaching skills. A model teaching module that is open access could provide the necessary tools to meet this need.",,,

Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2021,9,Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Building Trust to Protect Nursing Home Staff and Residents.,"Vaccines are critical to protect both nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19, but some staff have expressed reservations about being vaccinated. In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare—one of the largest US long-term care providers—implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees' family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs.","Feifer, Richard A.","Bethea, LaShuan","Genesis HealthCare, Kennett Square, PA, USA"
Journal of Women's Health (15409996),2016,4,Narratives of Participants in National Career Development Programs for Women in Academic Medicine: Identifying the Opportunities for Strategic Investment.,"Background: Academic medicine has initiated changes in policy, practice, and programs over the past several decades to address persistent gender disparity and other issues pertinent to its sociocultural context. Three career development programs were implemented to prepare women faculty to succeed in academic medicine: two sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which began a professional development program for early career women faculty in 1988. By 1995, it had evolved into two programs one for early career women and another for mid-career women. By 2012, more than 4000 women faculty from medical schools across the U.S and Canada had participated in these intensive 3-day programs. The third national program, the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine® (ELAM) program for women, was developed in 1995 at the Drexel University College of Medicine. Methods: Narratives from telephone interviews representing reflections on 78 career development seminars between 1988 and 2010 describe the dynamic relationships between individual, institutional, and sociocultural influences on participants' career advancement. Results: The narratives illuminate the pathway from participating in a career development program to self-defined success in academic medicine in revealing a host of influences that promoted and/or hindered program attendance and participants' ability to benefit after the program in both individual and institutional systems. The context for understanding the importance of these career development programs to women's advancement is nestled in the sociocultural environment, which includes both the gender-related influences and the current status of institutional practices that support women faculty. Conclusions: The findings contribute to the growing evidence that career development programs, concurrent with strategic, intentional support of institutional leaders, are necessary to achieve gender equity and diversity inclusion.","Helitzer, Deborah L.","Newbill, Sharon L.","Department of Family and Community Medicine, School of Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico."

Family Relations,2015,12,Role of Institutional Climate on Underrepresented Faculty Perceptions and Decision Making in Use of Work-Family Policies.,"The authors examined the institutional challenges that underrepresented minority ( URM) faculty perceive in higher education with use of family support workplace policies. Evidence reveals that faculty encounter differences in access to information and explanations of how to use workplace-family statutes. A qualitative study of 58 URM faculty members highlighted five particularly notable themes: (a) faculty perceptions of how the institution views their family caregiving responsibilities, (b) inadequate compensation matters in the utilization of formal policies, (c) informal policies are often inaccessible and invisible, (d) social networks affect the inclusiveness of work-family institutional practices, and (e) fear of being regarded as a 'red flag' constrains decisions regarding the use of policies. Given the push in higher education to diversify its faculty ranks, if administrators are to successfully implement diversity, equity, and inclusion and retain URM faculty, institutions need to pay particular attention to how URM faculty experience the academic climate regarding work-family balance.","Castañeda, Mari","Zambrana, Ruth Enid",University of Massachusetts at Amherst

Neuroscience Letters,2021,2,Integrative STEM education for undergraduate neuroscience: Design and implementation.,"• Neuroscience curricula can promote integrative thinking and broad STEM proficiency. • Integrative neuroscience curricula can be developed with anti-deficit goals. • Integrative STEM curriculum development can promote faculty development. • Curriculum mapping can be used to assess STEM curricula from the student perspective. • Curriculum mapping can create an institutional locus of accountability for inclusion. As an integrative discipline, neuroscience can serve as a vehicle for the development of integrative thinking skills and broad-based scientific proficiency in undergraduate students. Undergraduate neuroscience curricula incorporate fundamental concepts from multiple disciplines. Deepening the explicit exploration of these connections in a neuroscience core curriculum has the potential to support more meaningful and successful undergraduate STEM learning for neuroscience students. Curriculum and faculty development activities related to an integrative core curriculum can provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines and departments to advance common goals of inclusive excellence in STEM. These efforts facilitate analysis of the institutional STEM curriculum from the student perspective, and assist in creating an internal locus of accountability for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the institution. Faculty at the College of the Holy Cross have undertaken the collaborative design and implementation of an integrative core curriculum for neuroscience that embraces principles of inclusive pedagogy, emphasizes the connections between neuroscience and other disciplines, and guides students to develop broad proficiency in fundamental STEM concepts and skills.","Basu, Alo C.","Hill, Alexis S.","Department of Psychology, College of the Holy Cross, 1 College Street, Worcester, MA, 01610, USA"

Intelligence,2021,7,Reducing adverse impact in high-stakes testing.,"A critical goal for psychological science in the 21st century is to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in occupational contexts. One arena which will continue to benefit from a focus on equity is high-stakes testing , such as the assessments used for personnel selection and classification decisions. We define an equitable test as one that minimizes group differences based on protected classes such as race, sex, and ethnicity, while predicting criterion performance equivalently across groups. In this article, we provide an overview of the concepts of test equity, adverse impact, and predictive bias. We discuss how group differences in performance on high-stakes tests such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) could be driven by differences in crystallized intelligence (i.e., acquired knowledge), which is emphasized by the ASVAB subtests and related to socioeconomic status. We suggest that shifting the focus of some high-stakes assessments away from crystallized intelligence or supplementing them with other cognitive constructs could mitigate group differences in performance without sacrificing criterion validity. In particular, we provide evidence that tests of attention control —the domain-general ability to maintain focus on task-relevant information and resist distraction—could provide a more equitable path forward. • The use of high-stakes tests for personnel selection can result in adverse impact. • Adverse impact refers to inequitable selection of members of a protected class. • We suggest shifting the focus of some assessments away from acquired knowledge. • Attention control tests could reduce impact without sacrificing criterion validity.","Burgoyne, Alexander P.","Mashburn, Cody A.","Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"

The target stimuli were presented in foveal vision, where masking effects are generally investigated and where crowding effects are typically small compared to peripheral vision. The second experiment investigated the potential involvement of the dorsal visual pathway by testing if a peripheral crowding stimulus could interfere with the perception of a target shape, if it were scaled to account for low visual acuity? The results of both experiments indicated strong congruency effects, especially for pattern and metacontrast masking (which, in some respects, is similar to crowding). Congruency effects were generally weak for distractors presented further from the target. In Experiment 2, cortically scaled distractors only showed a potential influence in the forward masking condition. Perhaps this is an indication of a priming effect from the distant crowding stimuli. Further research might reveal the extent to which crowding displays can test physiologically motivated hypotheses.","Haase, Steven J.","Fisk, Gary D.","Shippensburg University, Psychology Department, 115 FSC, Shippensburg, PA, USA"

Journal of Medical Education & Curricular Development,2020,10,A Novel Curriculum for Medical Student Training in LGBTQ Healthcare: A Regional Pathway Experience.,"Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals face considerable health disparities, often due to a lack of LGBTQ-competent care. Such disparities and lack of access to informed care are even more staggering in rural settings. As the state medical school for the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) region, the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM) is in a unique position to train future physicians to provide healthcare that meets the needs of LGBTQ patients both regionally and nationally. Objective: To describe our methodology of developing a student-driven longitudinal, region-wide curriculum to train medical students to provide high-quality care to LGBTQ patients. Methods: A 4-year LGBTQ Health Pathway was developed and implemented as a student-led initiative at the UWSOM. First- and second-year medical students at sites across the WWAMI region are eligible to apply. Accepted Pathway students complete a diverse set of pre-clinical and clinical components: online modules, didactic courses, longitudinal community service/advocacy work, a scholarly project, and a novel clinical clerkship in LGBTQ health developed specifically for this Pathway experience. Students who complete all requirements receive a certification of Pathway completion. This is incorporated into the Medical Student Performance Evaluation as part of residency applications. Results: The LGBTQ Health Pathway is currently in its fourth year. A total of 43 total students have enrolled, of whom 37.3% are based in the WWAMI region outside of Seattle. Pathway students have completed a variety of scholarly projects on LGBTQ topics, and over 1000 hours of community service/advocacy. The first cohort of 8 students graduated with a certificate of Pathway completion in spring 2020. Conclusions: The LGBTQ Health Pathway at UWSOM is a novel education program for motivated medical students across the 5-state WWAMI region. The diverse milestones, longitudinal nature of the program, focus on rural communities, and opportunities for student leadership are all strengths and unique aspects of this program. The Pathway curriculum and methodology described here serve as a model for student involvement and leadership in medical education. This program enables medical students to enhance their training in the care of LGBTQ patients and provides a unique educational opportunity for future physicians who strive to better serve LGBTQ populations.","Gibson, Alec W","Gobillot, Theodore A","University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA"

The results provide a retrospective understanding of the lived experiences of aspiring medical professionals and their perceptions of the impact of a high-stakes licensure examination.","Templeton, Kimberly","Vanston, Patricia","Professor and vice-chair for diversity, equity, and inclusion, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas"
Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases,2022,6,A lack of race and ethnicity data in the treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a systematic review of intravenous bevacizumab efficacy.,"<bold>Background: </bold>For extreme hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) disease, treatments such as intravenous bevacizumab are often utilized. However, whether its efficacy is similar across diverse races and ethnicities is unclear.<bold>Methods: </bold>In this systematic review, we performed a search for English-language articles identified through PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases whose research occurred in the United States (US). Search terms related to HHT, epistaxis, and intravenous bevacizumab. We searched specifically for the intervention of intravenous bevacizumab because the term serves as a suitable surrogate to convey a patient who has both a diagnosis of HHT and established care. We focused on number of patients recruited in intravenous bevacizumab trials who were identified by race or ethnicity.<bold>Results: </bold>Our search identified 79 studies, of which four were conducted in the US. These four were selected for our systematic review. In these studies, 58 total patients were evaluated (ranging from 5 to 34 participants), whereby, information on age and gender were included. However, none of the US-based studies shared race or ethnicity data.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Inability to find studies regarding intravenous bevacizumab use in patients with HHT in which race and ethnicity are reported limits our ability to understand the therapy's efficacy in specific populations. Without emphasis on race and ethnicity in such trials, showing the potential of HHT-related diversity in individuals with this disease may reaffirm implicit bias around HHT diagnosis and treatment. Future work on HHT should emphasize sociodemographic data collection and reporting in an effort to understand this disease in diverse populations.","Galiatsatos, Panagis","Wilson, Cheri","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"

Operating from a critical perspective, we draw from Critical Race Theory, Disability Studies in Education, and Cultural/Historical Activity Theory to build a conceptual framework for examining the prevailing ideology of normal found in US schools. We use our conceptual framework todeconstructthe current, westernised, static ideology of normal. Once deconstructed, we explore current iterations of the ideology of normal in schools. Finally, we suggest using the conceptual framework as a tool toreconstructthe ideology of normal as something more dynamic and inclusive.","Annamma, Subini A.","Boelé, Amy L.","School of Education, Indiana University-Indianapolis, 902 W, New York Street,ES 3116, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA"

Journal of Medical Education & Curricular Development,2020,1,A Novel Curriculum for Medical Student Training in LGBTQ Healthcare: A Regional Pathway Experience.,"Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals face considerable health disparities, often due to a lack of LGBTQ-competent care. Such disparities and lack of access to informed care are even more staggering in rural settings. As the state medical school for the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) region, the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM) is in a unique position to train future physicians to provide healthcare that meets the needs of LGBTQ patients both regionally and nationally. Objective: To describe our methodology of developing a student-driven longitudinal, region-wide curriculum to train medical students to provide high-quality care to LGBTQ patients. Methods: A 4-year LGBTQ Health Pathway was developed and implemented as a student-led initiative at the UWSOM. First- and second-year medical students at sites across the WWAMI region are eligible to apply. Accepted Pathway students complete a diverse set of pre-clinical and clinical components: online modules, didactic courses, longitudinal community service/advocacy work, a scholarly project, and a novel clinical clerkship in LGBTQ health developed specifically for this Pathway experience. Students who complete all requirements receive a certification of Pathway completion. This is incorporated into the Medical Student Performance Evaluation as part of residency applications. Results: The LGBTQ Health Pathway is currently in its fourth year. A total of 43 total students have enrolled, of whom 37.3% are based in the WWAMI region outside of Seattle. Pathway students have completed a variety of scholarly projects on LGBTQ topics, and over 1000 hours of community service/advocacy. The first cohort of 8 students graduated with a certificate of Pathway completion in spring 2020. Conclusions: The LGBTQ Health Pathway at UWSOM is a novel education program for motivated medical students across the 5-state WWAMI region. The diverse milestones, longitudinal nature of the program, focus on rural communities, and opportunities for student leadership are all strengths and unique aspects of this program. The Pathway curriculum and methodology described here serve as a model for student involvement and leadership in medical education. This program enables medical students to enhance their training in the care of LGBTQ patients and provides a unique educational opportunity for future physicians who strive to better serve LGBTQ populations.","Gibson, Alec W","Gobillot, Theodore A","University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA"

Innovative Higher Education,2022,4,Disrupting Bias Without Trainings: The Effect of Equity Advocates on Faculty Search Committees.,"Many institutions of higher education have implemented workshops for hiring committee members to familiarize them with the pernicious effects of implicit bias and how to counteract them. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm for implicit bias trainings is not matched by the evidence for their effectiveness. Recognizing the difficulty of removing entrenched biases and the potential for trainings to backfire, we introduced the role of equity advocate (EA) at one institution. EAs are trained volunteer faculty and staff members who serve on search committees outside their home departments to identify behaviors and judgments that might have a disparate racial effect in hiring. We conducted focus groups to document the perspectives of both EAs and non-EA search committee members who completed a cycle of academic hiring. Search committee members credited EAs with helping to mitigate bias by questioning their assumptions and introducing standardized tools for evaluating candidates. By contrast, EAs reported a more contentious relationship with the rest of the search committee and expressed less confidence that the process was free from bias. Both groups agreed that the EAs added valuable race-conscious equitable practices, and untrained committee members identified ways they could apply the lessons of bias reduction in other parts of their professional roles. Our study provides evidence for how to engage all faculty and staff members in sustainable, equity-minded efforts.","Cahn, Peter S.","Gona, Clara M.","Office of the Provost, MGH Institute of Health Professions, 36 First Avenue, 02129, Boston, MA, USA"

"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics",2023,5,Spanish Adaptation and Evaluation of Clinical Discussion Guides: Communicating the External Beam Radiotherapy Experience (CEBRE) en Español.,"Cancer is the leading cause of death for the Hispanic/Latinx United States (US) community, which comprises 64% of the US population with limited English proficiency. Despite the common use of radiation therapy for cancer treatment, there is a dearth of radiation therapy educational materials—at appropriate reading levels—available in Spanish. To address the gap in patient-centered educational resources for communicating with Spanish-speaking patients about radiation therapy, we sought to linguistically and culturally adapt the Communicating the External Beam Radiotherapy Experience (CEBRE) clinical discussion guide series into Spanish. From January to December 2021, we developed and applied a stepwise methodology for Spanish adaptation of the discussion guides involving (1) professional translation; (2) interprofessional review for linguistic and cultural appropriateness and medical accuracy; (3) design review; and (4) evaluation for readability, understandability, and actionability using validated tools. We applied 4 indices for readability evaluation: Gilliam-Peña-Mountain, Läsbarhetsindex, Rate Index, and the Spanish Simple Measure of Gobbledygook. Two trained reviewers assessed understandability and actionability using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. After 2 revision rounds, 4 CEBRE en español discussion guides were produced through an interprofessional, iterative translation and linguistic/cultural adaptation process. Readability scores across the 4 guides ranged from 4.3 to 7.3 grade-level equivalents, thereby meeting the American Medical Association's 8th-grade standard. Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool analysis yielded near-perfect scores along understandability and actionability domains. The stepwise linguistic/cultural adaptation process yielded a patient-centered guide that is appropriately readable, understandable, and actionable for Spanish-speaking patients receiving radiation therapy in the US. Future work should include an external evaluation of CEBRE en español by clinicians and patients. The methodology described can be applied to adapting resources for patient-centered communication in other fields of medicine and into other languages as part of an interprofessional approach to delivering equitable health care for all.","Avila, Santiago","Franco, Idalid","Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois"
Teaching & Learning in Medicine,2023,4,"Confidence, Connection & Collaboration: Creating a Scalable Bias Reduction Improvement Coaching Train-the-Trainer Program to Mitigate Implicit Bias across a Medical Center.","Abstract <bold> <italic>Problem:</italic> </bold> Academic medical centers need to mitigate the negative effects of implicit bias with approaches that are empirically-based, scalable, sustainable, and specific to departmental needs. Guided by Kotter’s Model of Change to create and sustain cultural change, we developed the Bias Reduction Improvement Coaching Program (BRIC), a two-year, train-the-trainer implicit bias coaching program designed to meet the increasing demand for bias training across a university medical center. <bold> <italic>Intervention:</italic> </bold> BRIC trained a cohort of faculty and staff as coaches during four quarterly training sessions in Year 1 that covered 1) the science of bias, 2) bias in selection and hiring, 3) bias in mentoring, and 4) bias in promotion, retention, and workplace culture. In Year 2, coaches attended two booster sessions and delivered at least two presentations. BRIC raises awareness of bias mitigation strategies in a scalable way by uniquely building capacity through department-level champions, providing programming that addresses the ‘local context,’ and setting a foundation for sustained institutional change. <bold> <italic>Context:</italic> </bold> In a U.S. academic medical center, 27 faculty and staff from 24 departments were trained as inaugural BRIC coaches. We assessed outcomes at multiple levels: BRIC coach outcomes (feedback on the training sessions; coach knowledge, attitudes, and skills), departmental-level outcomes (program attendee feedback, knowledge, and intentions) and institutional outcomes (activities to sustain change). <bold> <italic>Impact:</italic> </bold> After Year 1, coaches reported high satisfaction with BRIC and a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy in their abilities to recognize, mitigate, and teach about implicit bias. In Year 2, attendees at BRIC coach presentations reported an increase in bias mitigation knowledge, and the majority committed to taking follow-up action (e.g., taking an Implicit Association Test). Coaches also launched activities for sustaining change at the broader university and beyond. <bold> <italic>Lessons Learned:</italic> </bold> The BRIC Program indicates a high level of interest in receiving bias mitigation training, both among individuals who applied to be BRIC coaches and among presentation attendees. BRIC’s initial success supports future expansion. The model appears scalable and sustainable; future efforts will formalize the emerging community of practice around bias mitigation and measure elements of on-going institutional culture change.","Cheng, Susan M.","McKinney, Caleb C.","Department of Family Medicine, Senior Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Georgetown University School of Medicine"
Teaching of Psychology,2023,4,"Recommendations for Creating and Teaching a Graduate Psychology Course Exclusively for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Students.","Introduction: Although the development of graduate psychology trainees' multicultural competence is established to be a necessity, current training implicitly and explicitly centers White clinicians. Statement of the Problem: This orientation leads to inadequate opportunities for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) trainees to access mentoring, learning, and support. Literature Review: We review the focus in graduate psychology training centered on White clinicians and the need to develop actively anti-racist training specifically suited to BIPOC clinicians. We discuss the principles of decolonization and collective liberation that can underlie such training. Teaching implications: A course called In the Center (ITC) was exclusively offered to BIPOC students to prioritize their needs and strengths. Based on ITC, we recommend instructors consider institutional context, ground teaching practices in values, utilize co-teaching, target multiple competencies, and address classroom racial dynamics to build greater community and solidarity among BIPOC students. Conclusion: This article discusses considerations for equitable, anti-racist training for BIPOC graduate psychology students built upon principles of decolonization and collective liberation.","Kadaba, Meiyang L.","Chow, Joshua S.","Office of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion, 1662 The Wright Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA"
JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine,2023,4,National Institutes of Health Diversity Supplement Awards by Medical School.,"Background: Increasing medical school faculty diversity is an urgent priority. National Institutes of Health (NIH) diversity supplements, which provide funding and career development opportunities to individuals underrepresented in research, are an important mechanism to increase faculty diversity. Objective: Analyze diversity supplement utilization by medical schools. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: All R01 grant–associated diversity supplements awarded to medical schools from 2005 to 2020. Diversity supplements were identified using the publicly available NIH RePORTER database. Main Measures: Main measures were the number of R01-associated diversity supplements awarded to medical schools each year by medical school NIH funding status and the number of R01-associated diversity supplements awarded to individual medical schools in the NIH top 40 by funding status. We also examined the percentage of R01 grants with an associated diversity supplement by NIH funding status and individual medical school in the NIH top 40. Key Results: From 2005 to 2020, US medical school faculty received 1389 R01-associated diversity supplements. The number of diversity supplements awarded grew from 2012 to 2020, from ten to 187 for top 40 schools, and from seven to 83 for non-top 40 schools. The annual growth rate for diversity supplement awards at NIH top 40 schools (44.2%) was not significantly different than the annual growth rate among non-top 40 schools (36.2%; p = 0.68). From 2005 to 2020, the highest number of diversity supplements that an individual medical school received was 56 and the lowest number was four (mean = 24.6, SD = 11.7). The highest percentage of R01 grants with an associated diversity supplement received by a school was 4.5% and the lowest percentage was 0.79% (mean = 2.3%, SD = 0.98). Conclusion: Medical schools may be missing an opportunity to address the continuing shortage of individuals historically underrepresented in biomedical science and should consider additional mechanisms to enhance diversity supplement utilization.","Hill, Katherine A.","Desai, Mayur M.","Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, 06520, New Haven, CT, USA"

PLoS ONE,2022,1,"New York City jails: COVID discharge policy, data transparency, and reform.","During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the release of individuals incarcerated in New York City jails who were at high risk of contracting the disease and at low risk of committing criminal reoffense. Using public information, we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city jail system from 2014—2020, paying special attention to what happened during the week of March 23—29, 2020, immediately following the mayor's order. In concordance with de Blasio's stated policy, we find that being discharged during this focus week is associated with a lower probability of readmission as compared to being discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. Furthermore, comparing the individuals discharged during the focus week of 2020 to those discharged during the same calendar week in previous years, we find that the former group was, on average, slightly older than the latter group, although the difference is not large. Additionally, the individuals in the former group had spent substantially longer in jail than those in the latter group. With the release of long-serving individuals demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%. Because our results are only as accurate as New York City's public-facing jail data, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements related to the incarcerated individual's age, gender, race, and more. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. One such reform might involve identifying and discharging low-risk individuals sooner in general, which might be feasible given the de Blasio administration's actions during the early stages of COVID-19.","Miller, Eli","Martin, Bryan D.","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States of America"

American Psychologist,2023,2,Opportunities for Psychologists to Advance Health Equity: Using Liberation Psychology to Identify Key Lessons From 17 Years of Praxis.,"Health and health care inequities persist because the efforts to eliminate them have ignored structural racism, typically using a power neutral approach to diagnose and solve the problem. Critical theory can address many of the conceptual weaknesses of current approaches, help identify how racism operates in health care, and open the door for more effective individual employee and organizational actions to advance health equity. We apply Martín-Baró’s (1996) liberation psychology to lessons we learned through implementing a transdisciplinary national health and health care equity program. The program, which began in 2005, conducts equity-focused health services interventions and research, using the best available evidence to assist health and health care policymakers, payers, community-based organizations, care delivery organizations, and patients to transform and align their activities in order to advance health equity. It serves as a rare model to explore how misconceptions resulting from racist structures can hinder progress, even when everyone involved is highly motivated to address health and health care inequities. Liberation psychology guides our interpretation of the lessons learned and recommendations for the field of psychology. Psychologists advancing equity in health and health care should integrate liberation psychology and other critical theories into their own work. In addition, partnerships with other disciplines and communities outside of academia and professional health services are key to success.","Cook, Scott C.","Todi´c, Jelena","The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Advancing Health Equity: Leading Care, Payment, and Systems Transformation Program, Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago."

Pathogens & Disease,2023,1,Strategies for change: thriving as an individual with a disabilty in STEMM.,"Disability remains an underacknowledged and underdiscussed topic in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). Social stigma and fear of negative outcomes have resulted in a consistent lack of disclosure. Disabilities cause social and professional difficulties for those that have them. While some faculty can be allies, past literature shows that steps must be taken to make disabilities visible in STEMM at both student and faculty levels. Here, we offer suggestions to better support faculty and students in enhancing the outcomes of individuals who have invisible disabilities. Critically, techniques such as abolishing stigma, universal learning, and better mentoring may improve the challenges faced by those who self-identify as an individual with a disability. We discuss disability in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine, why faculty and students with a disability remain underresourced, and potential solutions to increase universal design and representation of individuals with a disability.","Crabtree, Amber","Neikirk, Kit","Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, United States"

Outcomes of logistic regression models were decreasing PA activity (reference: maintaining or increasing) and increasing PA activity (reference: maintaining or decreasing). The main predictor was social connectedness as a combined variable: not living alone (reference: living alone) and communicating with others outside the home more than once/week (reference: once/week or less). We adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, physical function level, and education.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared with participants who were not socially connected, socially connected participants had lower odds of decreasing PA (adjusted odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.95). Odds of increasing PA (vs decreasing or maintaining PA) were not significantly different among socially connected and not socially connected participants. Associations between social connectedness and decreasing PA did not significantly differ by age (<85 vs ≥85 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White vs other races/ethnicity), education (college vs <college), use of technology to stay in touch with others, or Research and Development physical function score (≤75 vs >75).<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Social connectedness was associated with lower odds of decreasing PA among older women during the pandemic.

Health Services Research,2022,12,Listening to patients: Opportunities to improve reproductive wellness for women with chronic conditions.,"Objective: To understand how Black and Native American women with chronic conditions experience reproductive health care and identify patient‐centered strategies to improve care. Study Setting and Participants: We held a series of virtual focus groups between February 2021 and December 2021 with 34 women who self‐identified as Black or Native American, were of childbearing age, had one or more chronic conditions, and lived in North Carolina. Study Design and Analysis: This qualitative, community‐engaged study reviewed notes, video recordings, and graphic illustrations from the focus group sessions. Content analysis was used to iteratively identify themes. Emerging themes were reviewed by community and patient partners. Principal Findings: There were six thematic areas that emerged on the current state of reproductive health care for people with chronic conditions: (1) lack of trust in health care providers and institutions, (2) lack of health care provider knowledge, (3) uncoordinated care, (4) need for self‐advocacy, (5) provider bias, and (6) mental health strain from coping. Six approaches for care improvement emerged: (1) build on models of coordinated health care services from other conditions to design more comprehensive care clinics, (2) involve care coordinators or navigators, (3) improve educational materials for patients, (4) train clinicians to increase their capacity to be trustworthy and provide quality, equitable, person‐focused care, (5) design scripts to improve clinicians' ability to talk with women about infertility, miscarriage, infant loss, and (6) all interventions and research should be co‐designed to address patient priorities. Conclusions: Engaging Black and Native American patient partners with chronic conditions in research planning is feasible, necessary, and beneficial using methods that support connection, respect, and bi‐directional learning. Patient partners defined actionable strategies to improve reproductive care and wellness including comprehensive care clinics with patient navigators, trust‐enhancing interventions, and better provision of reproductive health related education.","Verbiest, Sarah","Cené, Crystal","Jordan Institute for Families, School of Social Work, Collaborative for Maternal and Infant Health School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill North Carolina,, USA"

The design of the JITT curriculum appropriate for school-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic is vital, as every individual has a role to play in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. When working with various communities, considering culture and religion is essential, as aligning values and beliefs with the JITT curriculum's objectives may significantly change the community's behavior toward a public health crisis. In this narrative, we describe how a JITT curriculum for the COVID-19 pandemic, created in Maryland, US, and implemented in a Catholic school system, aligned with core Catholic social teachings. This alignment allowed for implementing and delivering the COVID-19 curriculum in Maryland's Archdiocese Catholic school system, culminating in a medical-religious partnership that serves as a model for future public health crises.","Galiatsatos, Panagis","Soybel, Alexandria","Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"

Through existing relationships established by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based organizations through meetings titled ""Congregational COVID-19 Conversations."" Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely.","Monson, Kimberly","Oluyinka, MopeninuJesu","Healthy Community Partnership, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"

The objective of this report is to highlight the support and resources of congregational and faith-based leaders available in an urban city with a high prevalence of gun violence. We describe information and insights presented during a symposium uniting medical-religious partners to discuss actions and programs to address trauma from gun violence. Faith-based persons from various Abrahamic religions, ranging from imams to reverends to hospital-based chaplains, discussed key strategies to allocate resources to second victims. These strategies included religious rituals meant to cope with trauma, memorials, and providing insight into resiliency for difficult times. Resources were identified for both within the hospital and community. Such medical-religious resources should be considered for future interventions which aim to attenuate the consequences of gun violence for second victims.","Galiatsatos, Panagis","Cudjoe, Thomas K.

PLoS ONE,2021,5,"Impacts of California Proposition 47 on crime in Santa Monica, California.","We examine patterns of reported crime in Santa Monica, California before and after the passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies as misdemeanors. We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes—larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property—and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: city-wide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community-based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions. While our research detects changes in reported crime, it does not provide causative explanations. Our work, along with other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, may be useful to law enforcement and policymakers to assess the overall effect of Proposition 47.","Crodelle, Jennifer","Vallejo, Celeste","Department of Mathematics, Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT, United States of America"
PLoS ONE,2021,5,"Affirmative action, critical mass, and a predictive model of undergraduate student body demographics.","Black and Latinx students are underrepresented on most public university campuses. At the same time, affirmative action policies are controversial and legally fraught. The Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action should help a minoritized group achieve a critical mass of representation. While the idea of critical mass is frequently invoked in law and in policy, the term remains ill-defined and hence difficult to operationalize. Motivated by these challenges, we build a mathematical model to forecast undergraduate student body racial/ethnic demographics on public university campuses. Our model takes the form of a Markov chain that tracks students through application, admission, matriculation, retention, and graduation. Using publicly available data, we calibrate our model for two different campuses within the University of California system, test it for accuracy, and make a 10-year prediction. We also propose a coarse definition of critical mass and use our model to assess progress towards it at the University of California-Berkeley. If no policy changes are made over the next decade, we predict that the Latinx population on campus will move towards critical mass but not achieve it, and that the Black student population will decrease, moving further below critical mass. Because affirmative action is banned in California and in nine other states, it is worthwhile to consider alternative policies for diversifying a campus, including targeted recruitment and retention efforts. Our modeling framework provides a setting in which to test the efficacy of affirmative action and of these alternative policies.","Maes, Daniel P.","Tucher, Julia","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States of America"

This study contrasts views of university students with very low or high food security scores with respect to: obstacles to healthy eating, food pantry use, and managing dietary and educational needs. Method. Comments on open-ended survey questions (n = 1374) were counted, compared, and thematically analyzed to discern differences between the two student groups. Results. Cost concerns were paramount among students with very low food security scores. Students with very low food security experienced significant challenges in reconciling dietary needs and long-term educational goals; this was not problematic among students with high food security. Students from both very low and high food security groups mostly expressed an openness to the campus food pantry, though stigma associated with its use remained a deterrent. Conclusion. While all students face similar challenges to healthy eating, food security status substantially shapes dietary health and the management of dietary and educational needs.","Weaver, Robert R.","Hendricks, Sean P.","Dept of Health and Exercise Science, Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey, USA"
Nursing Research,2022,11,A Concept Development for the Symptom Science Model 2.0.,"Background: The National Institute of Nursing Research developed the National Institutes of Health symptom science model (SSM) in 2015 as a parsimonious conceptual model to guide symptom science research. Objectives: This concept development paper synthesizes justifications to strengthen the original model. Methods: A literature review was performed, discussions with symptom science content expert stakeholders were held, and opportunities for expanding the current model were identified. Concept elements for a revised conceptual model—the SSM 2.0—were developed. Results: In addition to the four original concept elements (complex symptom presentation, phenotypic characterization, biobehavioral factors [previously biomarker discovery], and clinical applications), three new concept elements are proposed, including social determinants of health, patient-centered experience, and policy/population health. Discussion: There have been several calls to revise the original SSM from the nursing scientific community to expand its utility to other healthcare settings. Incorporating three additional concept elements can facilitate a broader variety of translational nursing research symptom science collaborations and applications, support additional scientific domains for symptom science activities, and produce more translatable symptom science to a wider audience of nursing research scholars and stakeholders during recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised SSM 2.0 with newly incorporated social determinants of health, patient-centered experience, and policy/population health components now empowers nursing scientists and scholars to address specific symptom science public health challenges particularly faced by vulnerable and underserved populations.","Kurnat-Thoma, Emma L.","Graves, Letitia Y.","Emma L.

Rhetoric & Public Affairs,2022,9,REVISIONING RHETORICAL VIOLENCE IN THE AFTERLIFE.,"In this essay, we attend to the rhetorical and spatio-temporal contours of how the urgency to recognize Black life and aid in struggle is detached from a recognition of the deep structural and ontological nature of antiblackness. We center on two seemingly disparate case studies to unpack these phenomena. First, we look at the state lynching of Breonna Taylor and the multiracial coalition that emerged around #sayhername, and second, we turn to the politics and rhetorics of DEI initiatives on college campuses. Guided by scholars writing on Black life, our project asks how we imagine the physicality of violence in this moment in ways that interrupt common frames of both the physical and the moment. We write at the intersection of two larger rhetorical conversations on racialized violence: stoppage and suffocation, and their respective interests in theories of racialized time. We argue that the variants of anti-Black stoppage and suffocation operate on multiple temporal registers of recognition that perform recognition even as they profit from antiblackness. For rhetorical scholars invested in studies of racial violence, the urgency of the moment should serve as a reminder that possibility lies in the inventional, an inventional that requires a disciplined, intentional, and persistent practice and commitment.","HOUDEK, MATTHEW","FLORES, LISA A.",Lecturer and the first year writing coordinator in the University Writing Program at Rochester Institute of Technology
Duke Law Journal,2021,2,THE CASE AGAINST CHEVRON DEFERENCE IN IMMIGRATION ADJUDICATION.,"The Duke Law Journal's fifty-first annual administrative law symposium examines the future of Chevron deference--the command that a reviewing court defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute the agency administers. In the lead article, Professors Kristin Hickman and Aaron Nielson argue that the Supreme Court should narrow Chevron's domain to exclude interpretations made via administrative adjudication. Building on their framing, this Article presents an in-depth case study of immigration adjudication and argues that this case against Chevron has perhaps its greatest force when it comes to immigration. That is because much of Chevron's theory for congressional delegation and judicial deference--including agency expertise, deliberative process, and even political accountability--collapses in the immigration adjudication context. As for potential reform, Professors Hickman and Nielson understandably focus on the Supreme Court. This Article also explores that judicial option but argues that it is a mistake to focus just on courts when it comes to immigration law and policy. The political branches can and should act to narrow Chevron's domain. First, this proposal should be part of any comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Second, the Executive Branch can and should embrace this reform internally--by not seeking Chevron deference in immigration adjudication and by turning to rulemaking instead of adjudication to make major immigration policy. Shifting the immigration policymaking default from adjudication to rulemaking is more consistent with Chevron's theoretical foundations--to leverage agency expertise, to engage in a deliberative process, and to increase political accountability.","WADHIA, SHOBA SIVAPRASAD","WALKER, CHRISTOPHER J.","Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Samuel Weiss Faculty Scholar"

Students ( n = 147) participated in two sessions of discussions, written activities, demonstrations and disability simulation activities. Results: Significant improvements ( p < 0.001) in knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of disability were evident immediately following the intervention. Focus group analyses further demonstrated these findings. Conclusions: A brief disability awareness programme for children improved knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of disability in the short-term. Further research is required to identify the potential impact of such programmes on inclusion and social participation of people with disabilities both inside and outside of the school setting.","Ison, Nicole","McIntyre, Sarah","University of Western Sydney, Equity and Diversity Unit, Penrith South, Sydney, Australia"

Change,2006,5,BETWEEN IMPARTIALITY AND BIAS.,"The article reports that monitoring class discussions is hardly a way to encourage freedom of speech, and using students to spy on faculty does not teach them to make reasoned arguments on their own behalf. It is striking that the actions of those who say that they are struggling for the general principles of open-minded and inclusive inquiry do not correspond with the principles they claim. There are ways to seek the validation and inclusion of theories in the academic world. Through differing methods, all disciplines subject their own truth claims to evaluation. Scholarship presupposes the differentiation of knowledge from opinion, convention, faith, prejudice, and ideology. The ability to make apt distinctions and to think and to reason in both disciplined and flexible ways is central to educators' goal of enhancing the critical thinking that will be appropriately practiced in differing spheres of knowledge. The author says that freedom of speech, intellectual diversity, and impartial inquiry are not values that validate political campaigns to impose controls on teachers.

Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica,2020,11,The effects of ketamine on typical and atypical depressive symptoms.,"Objective: Ketamine's effects on different dimensions of depressive symptomatology, including typical/melancholic and atypical depression, remain largely unknown. This study examined the effects of a single intravenous dose of ketamine on general depressive symptoms (measured using the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), typical/melancholic symptoms (measured using the MADRS5), and atypical symptoms (measured using the Scale for Atypical Symptoms (SAS)). Methods: Data from 68 participants with treatment‐resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression were pooled from three separate, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover studies investigating ketamine's efficacy in depression. MDD participants were unmedicated; bipolar participants received therapeutic‐dose lithium or valproate. Clinical symptoms were collected preinfusion and up to 14 days postinfusion. Effect sizes were calculated for days 1 and 3 postinfusion. The primary measures of interest for this exploratory analysis were total MADRS, MADRS5, and SAS scores. Individual symptoms were also analyzed in an exploratory manner. Results: Scores improved significantly at Day 1 postinfusion (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.64; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.61; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.41) and continued to be significantly improved over placebo at Day 3 (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.49; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.43; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.39). Effect sizes were greater for typical/melancholic than atypical symptoms at Day 1 postinfusion. Conclusion: Ketamine appears to effectively treat both the typical/melancholic and atypical symptoms of depression, but may have early preferential effects for the former.","Park, L.

Journal of Religion & Health,2020,10,Community Calls: Lessons and Insights Gained from a Medical–Religious Community Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"During the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, public health instructions were issued with the hope of curbing the virus' spread. In an effort to assure accordance with these instructions, equitable strategies for at-risk and vulnerable populations and communities are warranted. One such strategy was our community conference calls, implemented to disseminate information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. Over the first 6 weeks, we held 12 calls, averaging 125 (standard deviation 41) participants. Participants were primarily from congregations and faith-based organizations that had an established relationship with the hospital, but also included school leaders, elected officials, and representatives of housing associations. Issues discussed included reasons for quarantining, mental health, social isolation, health disparities, and ethical concerns regarding hospital resources. Concerns identified by the community leaders as barriers to effective quarantining and adherence to precautions included food access, housing density, and access to screening and testing. Through the calls, ways to solve such challenges were addressed, with novel strategies and resources reaching the community. This medical–religious resource has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants discussions on reproducing it for other communities during this and future infectious disease outbreaks.","Galiatsatos, Panagis","Monson, Kimberly","Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"

Gerontologist,2022,6,"Superwoman Schema, Racial Identity, and Cellular Aging Among African American Women.","Background and Objectives African American women experience faster telomere shortening (i.e. cellular aging) compared with other racial–gender groups. Prior research demonstrates that race and gender interact to influence culturally specific norms for responding to socially-relevant stress and other stress-coping processes, which may affect healthy aging. Research Design and Methods Data are from African American Women's Heart & Health Study participants who consented to DNA extraction (n = 140). Superwoman Schema (SWS) was measured using 5 validated subscales: presenting strength, emotion suppression, resisting vulnerability, motivation to succeed, and obligation to help others. Racial identity was measured using 3 subscales from the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity: racial centrality, private regard, and public regard. Relative telomere length (rTL) was measured using DNA extracted from blood samples. Path analysis tested associations and interactions between SWS and racial identity dimensions with rTL. Results For SWS, higher resistance to being vulnerable predicted longer telomeres. For racial identity, high private regard predicted longer telomeres while high public regard predicted shorter telomeres. Interactions were found between public regard and 2 SWS dimensions: among women with high public regard, emotion suppression (β = 0.20, p <.05) and motivation to succeed (β = 0.18, p <.05) were associated with longer rTL. The interaction between high centrality and emotion suppression predicted shorter rTL (β = −0.17, p <.05). Discussion and Implications Culturally specific responses to gendered racism and racial identity, developed early in life and shaped over the life course, are important psychosocial determinants of cellular aging among African American women.","Thomas, Marilyn D","Mendez, Rebecca M","Departments of Epidemiology & Biostatistics and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco , San Francisco, California , USA"

This qualitative study used the psychological concept of ""ego-depletion"" as an exploratory framework to better understand the disproportionate rates of reincarceration among people with injecting drug use histories. The aim was to illuminate mechanisms by which prospects for positive post-release outcomes for PWID are enhanced or constricted.<bold>Methods: </bold>Participants were recruited from a longitudinal cohort study, SuperMIX, in Victoria, Australia. Eligible participants were invited to participate in an in-depth interview. Inclusion criteria were: aged 18+; lifetime history of injecting drug use; incarcerated for >three months and released from custody <12 months previously. Analysis of 48 interviews examined how concepts relevant to the ego-depletion framework (self-regulation; standards; consequences and mitigators of ego-depletion) manifested in participants' narratives.<bold>Results: </bold>Predominantly, participants aimed to avoid a return to problematic drug use and recidivism, and engaged in effortful self-regulation to pursue their post-release goals. Post-release environments were found to diminish self-regulation resources, leading to states of ego-depletion and compromising the capacity to self-regulate according to their ideals. Fatalism, stress, and fatigue associated with the transition period exacerbated ego-depletion. Strategies that mitigated ego-depletion included avoidance of triggering environments; reducing stress through opioid agonist therapy; and fostering positive affect through supportive relationships.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Post-release environments are ego-depleting and inconducive to sustaining behavioural changes for PWID leaving prison. Corrections' behaviourist paradigms take insufficient account of the socio-structural factors impacting on an individual's self-regulation capacities in the context of drug dependence and desistance processes. Breaking the cycles of reincarceration among PWID requires new approaches that moderate ego-depletion and facilitate long-term goal-pursuit.","Schroeder, Sophia E.","Drysdale, Kerryn","Program for Behaviours and Health Risks, Burnet Institute, Australia"

PLoS ONE,2020,4,Comparing demographics of signatories to public letters on diversity in the mathematical sciences.,"In its December 2019 edition, the Notices of the American Mathematical Society published an essay critical of the use of diversity statements in academic hiring. The publication of this essay prompted many responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather, asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically against diversity statements, calling them ""a mistake,"" and claiming that their usage during early stages of faculty hiring ""diminishes mathematical achievement."" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities. Our empirical results are consistent with theories of power drawn from the social sciences.","Topaz, Chad M.","Cart, James","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States of America"

Canadian Journal of Bioethics / Revue canadienne de bioéthique,2022,5,Intersex Stigma and Discrimination: Effects on Patient-Centred Care and Medical Communication.,"Individuals with intersex variations fall outside the normative sex binary of male and female for various reasons. These individuals are highly stigmatized and discriminated against in the legal, medical and social spheres. In this paper, we analyze manifestations of such discrimination in the healthcare context and hypothesize that Patient Centred Care (PCC) and Shared Decision Making (SDM) approaches are improperly practiced with intersex individuals. Through a narrative review of current literature, we present evidence of improper practice of PCC and SDM and its effects on intersex individuals and, in the pediatric context, their parents. Misinformation by medical practitioners to parents of intersex individuals promotes the perpetuation of unnecessary surgical interventions. We propose strategies to improve intersex medical care, including better adherence to SDM and PCC guidelines as well as the sociocultural normalisation of intersex identity. Current perceptions of surgical interventions done on intersex infants and children need to better align with evidence-based physical and psychological health risks. All these strategies are part of preserving the autonomy and physical integrity of intersex individuals and ensuring that their well-being remains at the heart of their care in the medical context.","Charron, Marilou","Saulnier, Katie","Centre of Genomics and Policy (CGP), McGill University, Montreal, Canada."
American Criminal Law Review,2022,3,DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY.,"Criminal defense attorneys often engage in plea negotiations on behalf of their clients without knowledge of material, exculpatory information that the prosecution may possess, placing the defense at an unfair disadvantage. The recent proliferation of electronically-stored information (“ESI”) is further exacerbating this informational imbalance. Without proactively accounting for ESI in criminal discovery, the informational gulf existing between the prosecution and the defense during plea negotiations will continue to foster uninformed legal representation, inconsistent results, and an enduring lack of public confidence in the criminal justice system. Although scholars have promoted open-file criminal discovery as a cure to narrow this informational gap, neither the literature nor recently enacted open-file criminal discovery have sufficiently considered the importance of digitizing open-file criminal discovery to fix the imbalance. This Article argues for the nationwide implementation of digitized open-file criminal discovery schemes as a means of correcting the current pre-plea informational asymmetry, leading to more reliable results and improved defense lawyering. Digitizing open-file criminal discovery will produce a digital ecosystem of accountability benefitting both defendants and prosecutors alike.","Duncan, Meredith J.",,Alumnae College Professor of Law.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2022,3,Implementation of a rehabilitation model in a Program of All‐Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE): Preliminary data.,"Background: Nursing home eligible participants in the Program of All‐inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) are at high risk for falls. Physical function is a modifiable predictor of falls and an important target for prevention. We engaged a PACE site to explore feasibility of implementing progressive intensive rehabilitation to improve physical function and preliminary patient‐level improvements. Methods: The research involved a mixed‐methods, pre–post implementation study with longitudinal patient follow‐up at one Denver PACE site. Older adults at risk for institutionalization (N = 28) took part in Screening and high‐intensity interventions to Improve Falls risk and Transform expectations in age and aging (SHIFT) rehabilitation program over six weeks. Outcomes included the short physical performance battery (SPPB); 4‐meter gait speed at baseline, discharge, and 6 and 12 months postdischarge from SHIFT. A focus group with staff explored facilitators and barriers to program implementation in the PACE setting and with complex patients and perceived effectiveness. Results: The rehabilitation team demonstrated high treatment fidelity to SHIFT (>80%). No treatment‐specific adverse events were reported. SPPB scores and gait speeds improved significantly over time (p < 0.005). The average SPPB score at evaluation was 4.6 ± 0.24 compared to 7.7 ± 0.38 points at discharge. The average gait speed at evaluation was 0.58 ± 0.03 meters/second (m/s) compared to 0.79 ± 0.04 m/s at discharge. Common barriers to program completion included changes in health status and environmental factors (e.g., transportation). Conclusions: Rehabilitation therapists incorporated a high‐intensity resistance training program into routine care of complex older adults in PACE and improved pre–post physical function to levels above independence thresholds (SPPB ≥6; gait speed ≥0.65 m/s). Our pilot implementation study informed refinement of eligibility criteria, number of visits, and strategies to address long‐term adherence to enhance scalability and optimize impact.","Gustavson, Allison M.","LeDoux, Cherie V.","Physical Therapy Program, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Colorado, Aurora Colorado,, USA"

By examining a growing literature base alongside new empirical evidence, we explore whether the experiences of new migrants actually reflect the hypothetical claims made by some policy-makers and scholars about the role of sport in tackling exclusion, promoting inclusion and constructing interculturalism. We demonstrate that the claims made about the value of sport are not found in the experiences of most of our respondents from new migrant communities living in Leeds, UK. We question whether sport truly is communicative in the Habermasian sense, contributing to identity projects, and so counsel caution in using it as a panacea to promote belonging and cohesion.

Journal of Pan African Studies,2019,3,When Black Rights Do Not Matter: A Historical Analysis of Civil Litigation and 'Equal Protections Under Law'.,"In order to be truly American, one must experience one of two things: either privilege or denial. Thus, we develop notions of conceptual Whiteness and conceptual Blackness that both do and do not map neatly on to biogenetic or cultural allegiances (King 1995). A study of Urban education policy and analysis reveal the subjectivity of equality vs. equity in education. This subjectivity is found in the initial ideology of American citizenship and the perpetual question of ""What does it mean to be American?"" As a person of color in America, we ask ""When will my citizenship be acknowledged""? In the United States of America, property ownership and citizenship are correlates. As one owns property, one's citizenship is strengthened. In the case of Dred Scott, 1857, being born a slave and therefore, not a citizen, he could not legally sue for his freedom in federal court. This is because Dred Scott himself was considered property. With the continual footage chronicling deaths of Black men and women at the hands of law enforcement without charges being brought against the officers and very few instances of guilty verdicts, it has become increasingly clear that Black men and women, like Dred Scott, remain a caste group or property. Our rights like our lives do not matter. Hope for our future and that of our nation remain in a review and analysis of benchmarks in Urban education such as Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 and Edgewood v. Kirby, 1989. These benchmark cases provide that the 14th Amendment and Equal Protection Under Law provide a civil gateway to economic responsibility when the criminal accountability and justice are absent.","Griffen, Aaron J.",,"Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DSST Public Schools Denver, Colorado"
Utah Law Review,2019,1,HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: A MORE COMPELLING CASE FOR DIVERSITY.,"For four decades, the diversity rationale has offered a lifeline to affirmative action in higher education. Yet even after forty years, this critical feature of equal protection doctrine remains constitutionally insecure and politically fraught. Legal challenges persist, the Justice Department has launched a new assault on affirmative action, and a rightward shift on the Supreme Court could usher in an era of increased hostility toward the concept of diversity itself. The future of race-conscious admissions may hang in the balance. In this Article, I contend that the diversity rationale's present fragility rests, in part, on its defenders' failure to center diversity's most compelling quality: its ability to promote personal equality within the university. To fill this void, this Article advances the first comprehensive case for diversity rooted in each student's interest in an equal opportunity to enjoy, regardless of race, the full benefits of university membership. This framing is appealing, in part, because it makes salient the present and personal equality harms that students of color suffer when severely under-represented in predominately white institutions. Race-conscious admissions, in turn, emerge as an essential component of institutional efforts to further normative commitments--ranging from racial integration to individual meritocracy--that should resonate with Justices across the ideological spectrum. To support this new framing, I resurrect the Supreme Court's pre-Brown desegregation cases. These decisions reinforce the constitutional infirmity of institutional conditions that compromise a student's ability, because of her race, to access the full benefits of university membership. I then bridge the theory to social science that reveals how environmental cues--including racial demographics--can exact concrete and quantifiable burdens on students from negatively stereotyped groups. Although well-traveled in other domains, this research has only begun to inform legal scholarship.","Feingold, Jonathan P.",,"Research Fellow, BruinX, Special Assistant to the Vice Chancellor, UCLA Equity, Diversity and Inclusion"
Children & Schools,2018,10,Teachers' Perceptions of Student Mental Health: The Role of School-Based Mental Health Services Delivery Model.,"Authors examined teachers' perceptions of student mental health in the context of two school-based mental health (SBMH) services delivery models. Study participants included teachers (N = 468) involved in two different models of SBMH programs (on-site therapists versus community-based therapists) in a large school district in Southeast United States. Differences regarding the two models' effects on teachers' perceived awareness, knowledge, and comfort related to student mental health were compared. The authors also compared mental health training received by teachers and their satisfaction with the respective models. There were statistically significant differences between the two models in teachers' perceived awareness, knowledge, mental health training received, and satisfaction. However, teachers with in-school therapists were only comfortable accessing services for students with mental health issues and not necessarily talking with students about mental health. An SBMH services delivery model that has a dedicated therapist within the school increases the likelihood that teachers will be more aware and knowledgeable of student mental health, but more tailored trainings may be needed to better equip teachers with direct student management of mental health issues.","Osagiede, Osayande","Costa, Sheina","Osayande Osagiede, MBBS, MPH, is research fellow, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.

International Journal of Testing,2018,7,Incongruence Between Native and Test Administration Languages: Towards Equal Opportunity in International Literacy Assessment.,"Previous research has primarily addressed the effects of language on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) mathematics and science assessments. More recent research has focused on the effects of language on PISA reading comprehension and literacy assessments on student populations in specific Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. Recognizing calls to highlight the impact of language on student PISA reading performance across countries, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of home languages versus test languages on PISA reading literacy across OECD and non-OECD economies, while considering other factors. The results of Ordinary Least Squares regression showed that about half of the economies demonstrated a positive and significant effect of students' language status on their reading performance. This finding is consistent with observations in the parallel analysis of PISA 2009 data, suggesting that students' performance on reading literacy assessment was higher when they were tested in their home language. Our findings highlight the importance of the role of context, the need for new approaches to test translation, and the potential similarities in language status for youth from OECD and non-OECD countries that have implications for interpreting their PISA reading literacy assessments.","Smith, Patriann","Frazier, Paul","Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Language, Diversity and Literacy Studies, Texas Tech University, USA"
JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine,2022,2,Understanding Contributors to Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Emergency Department Throughput Times: a Sequential Mixed Methods Analysis.,"Background: Ensuring equitable care remains a critical issue for healthcare systems. Nationwide evidence highlights the persistence of healthcare disparities and the need for research-informed approaches for reducing them at the local level. Objective: To characterize key contributors in racial/ethnic disparities in emergency department (ED) throughput times. Design: We conducted a sequential mixed methods analysis to understand variations in ED care throughput times for patients eventually admitted to an emergency department at a single academic medical center from November 2017 to May 2018 (n=3152). We detailed patient progression from ED arrival to decision to admit and compared racial/ethnic differences in time intervals from electronic medical record time-stamp data. We then estimated the relationships between race/ethnicity and ED throughput times, adjusting for several patient-level variables and ED-level covariates. These quantitative analyses informed our qualitative study design, which included observations and semi-structured interviews with patients and physicians. Key Results: Non-Hispanic Black as compared to non-Hispanic White patients waited significantly longer during the time interval from arrival to the physician's decision to admit, even after adjustment for several ED-level and patient demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables (Beta (average minutes) (SE): 16.35 (5.8); p value=.005). Qualitative findings suggest that the manner in which providers communicate, advocate, and prioritize patients may contribute to such disparities. When the race/ethnicity of provider and patient differed, providers were more likely to interrupt patients, ignore their requests, and make less eye contact. Conversely, if the race/ethnicity of provider and patient were similar, providers exhibited a greater level of advocacy, such as tracking down patient labs or consultants. Physicians with no significant ED throughput disparities articulated objective criteria such as triage scores for prioritizing patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the importance of (1) understanding how our communication style and care may differ by race/ethnicity; and (2) taking advantage of structured processes designed to equalize care.","Aysola, Jaya","Clapp, Justin T.","Penn Medicine Center for Health Equity Advancement, Office of the CMO, University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia, PA, USA"
AMA Journal of Ethics,2021,12,"Does the AAMC's Definition of ""Underrepresented in Medicine"" Promote Justice and Inclusivity?","In 2003, the Association of American Medical Colleges reframed the concept underrepresented minorities as underrepresented in medicine (URiM), which defines representation in medicine relative to representation in the US population. Schools are permitted to construct URiM definitions, suggesting the importance of regarding them as fluid works in progress as US demographics evolve. Where medical school admissions processes consider applicants' backgrounds and experiences of identity minoritization to be valuable, progress toward inclusive representation has been made. This article considers whether school-based URiM definitions are ethically sufficient and canvasses possible next steps in realizing equitable representation in medical education.","Clay, Wendy A.","Jackson, Donna H.","Resident physician in Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine's psychiatry residency program in Dayton, Ohio"

The analysis of the historical development of HE in each nation identifies a set of comparative global themes: the expansion of HE in response to the needs of the national economy; globalisation and the changing labour market; social pressures for equity in access to HE; and the growing role of the central state in HE. The article presents a discussion of system differentiation based around the following characteristics: tuition fee and bursary regimes; institutional autonomy; institutional diversity; the strength of equity arguments; and the role of the state in widening participation. The article concludes with a discussion of the often complex interactions between these characteristics and aims to add to our understanding of the impact of student self-financing regimes on trajectories of system differentiation and on access and participation.","McCaig, Colin",,"Centre for Education and Inclusion Research Unit, Sheffield Hallam University, Science Park, Howard Street, Sheffield, UK"

Northwestern University Law Review,2018,5,EYES WIDE OPEN: WHAT SOCIAL SCIENCE CAN TELL US ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT'S USE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE.,"The Northwestern University Law Review's 2017 Symposium asked whether McCleskey v. Kemp closed the door on social science's ability to meaningfully contribute to equal protection deliberations. This inquiry is understandable; McCleskey is widely understood to have rendered statistical racial disparities doctrinally irrelevant in the equal protection context. We suggest, however, that this account overstates McCleskey and its doctrinal impact. Roughly fifteen years after McCleskey, Chief Justice William Rehnquist--himself part of the McCleskey majority--invoked admissions data to support his conclusion that the University of Michigan Law School unconstitutionally discriminated against white applicants. Chief Justice Rehnquist's disparate treatment of statistical evidence in McCleskey and Grutter v. Bollinger reveals the doctrine's underdeterminacy and invites a corresponding inquiry: why do Justices rely on social science in some cases, yet reject it in others? We propose that one answer lies at the intersections of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and empirical scholarship on motivated social cognition. This ""eCRT"" lens illuminates how ostensibly neutral biases and heuristics, when informed by socially salient racial stereotypes, will predictably and systematically lead judges to overvalue ""evidence"" that rationalizes existing racial disparities and, as a result, author legal opinions that re-instantiate and legitimize the status quo.","Feingold, Jonathan P.","Carter, Evelyn R.","Research Fellow, BruinX; Special Assistant to the Vice Chancellor, UCLA Equity, Diversity and Inclusion"
Educational Psychologist,2017,10,Teachers' Epistemic Cognition in Classroom Assessment.,"Epistemic cognition represents aspects of teachers' thinking focused on issues related to knowledge, which may have particular relevance for classroom assessment practices given that teachers must discern what their students know and then use this information to inform instruction. We present a model of epistemic cognition in teaching with a focus on teachers' classroom assessment practices. We argue that teachers' epistemic cognition is inherently more complex than current models developed for learners. Further, we suggest that teachers' epistemic cognition can be supported through the development of reflexivity as an epistemic virtue and that the 3R-EC framework for reflexivity represents one protocol for engaging in reflexive practice that targets epistemic cognition. We close the article with implications for teacher development and with recommendations for further theory and research.","Fives, Helenrose","Barnes, Nicole","Department of Educational Foundations, Montclair State University"

BACKGROUND: The US population is progressing to a minority-majority population. To effectively meet the needs of a diverse population, nursing recognizes the need to racially and ethnically diversify the workforce by increasing the diversity of students admitted to nursing schools. Although the need is widely known, minority groups remain underrepresented in nursing programs, and there is a need for sustainable recruitment and retention strategies. METHOD: An integrative literature review on how to foster the success of underrepresented students was performed. RESULTS: Proposed interventions include mentoring, financial support, academic and psychosocial support, and student success programs. CONCLUSION: Tailoring interventions to specific student needs would be effective in enhancing student success.","Kirui, Caroline","McGee, Jerrihlyn","American Red Cross clinic volunteer and health educator, Army Wellness Center, Stuttgart, Germany"

Latinx immigrants, in particular, face significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including lack of insurance, language barriers, stigma, work conflicts, and limited transportation.<bold>Methods: </bold>In response to a disproportionately high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Latinxs at the Johns Hopkins Health System, investigators implemented free community-based testing by partnering with religious leaders and leveraging the skill of trusted community health workers. Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests.<bold>Results: </bold>Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events. Among them, 355 (19.9%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 31.5% for Latinxs, 7.6% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 3.4% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 5.3% for patients of other races/ethnicities. Compared with Latinxs who tested negative, Latinxs who tested positive were more likely to report Spanish as their preferred language (91.6% vs 81.7%, p<0.001), be younger (30.4 vs 33.4 years, p<0.008), and have a larger household size (4.8 vs 4.3 members, p<0.002).<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Community-based testing identified high levels of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among primarily Latinxs with limited English proficiency.

This retrospective cohort study reveals the odds of hospitalization and mortality based on ASD for a population of insured patients with COVID-19. The odds of hospitalization and mortality for people with ASD were found to be greater than individuals without ASD when adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Hospitalization and mortality was associated with a dose-response increase to comorbidity counts (1 to 5+). Odds of mortality remained greater for those with ASD when adjusting for comorbid health conditions. ASD is a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.

Child Abuse & Neglect,2023,3,"A developmental cascade model of adolescent peer relationships, substance use, and psychopathological symptoms from child maltreatment.","Although previous studies have demonstrated high intercorrelations among deviant peer affiliation, substance use, externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescence, these studies have been limited because they did not examine 1) the associations over time by assuming one particular sequence; and 2) child maltreatment effects. This study included 617 adolescents (54.3 % girls, 55.6 % Black) at-risk of maltreatment living in the U.S and primarily low-income. Deviant peer affiliation was assessed at ages 12, 14, and 16 using 13 items from the modified version of the Youth Risk Behavior and Monitoring the Future Survey. Externalizing and internalizing symptoms were measured at ages 12, 14, and 16 using the Child Behavior Checklist. The number of substances used (ages 12, 14, 16, and 18) were created by summing the self-reported alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. Each type of maltreatment (birth to age 12) was assessed using the self-report. Autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation modeling explained the stability effects within each domain, as well as how different maltreatment types affect diverse developmental processes. Cross-lagged results showed the socialization effects of peers on substance use, whereas the peer selection effects on externalizing symptoms. Physical abuse was only associated with externalizing symptoms, while sexual abuse was associated with both externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Additionally, emotional abuse was associated with deviant peer affiliation and substance use. Identifying the underlying reciprocal processes offers a deeper understanding of peer relationships in the substance use and externalizing symptoms among at-risk of maltreatment sample.","Yoon, Dalhee","Yoon, Miyoung","Department of Social Work, Binghamton University-State University of New York, USA"

Journal of College Science Teaching,2021,5,The Undergraduate Teacher-Scholar Program: Comparing Near-Peer and Non Near-Peer Instructors in Laboratory Courses.,"Peer learning programs have been developed to support many introductory science courses by providing additional instruction and engagement. These programs are beneficial to both learners and instructors, providing content learning and confidence and attitudinal gains. There is evidence that the benefits of peer learning are higher when students are taught by a near-peer instructor who is close to the learner in age and experience. Building on this existing evidence, a peer learning program, the Undergraduate Teacher-Scholar (UGTS) Program, was created, involving both graduate student and near-peer instructors teaching in the same discussion or laboratory section. This format creates a vertical learning community within the course structure. The Teacher-Scholar program provides the opportunity to compare the roles of graduate student and near-peer instructors teaching the same students the same instructional material. We report differences and similarities in the perceived roles of the graduate student and near-peer instructors by all of the stakeholders involved in the program. Both graduate student and near-peer instructors are valued by students; however, the near-peer instructors provide mentorship and role model qualities that are not replaced by a graduate student instructor.","Bourne, Sara M.","Limfat, Sean","Elite Edge Tutoring in Oakland, California"
CHEST,2021,3,Operational Recommendations for Scarce Resource Allocation in a Public Health Crisis.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may require rationing of various medical resources if demand exceeds supply. Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, five health systems in Maryland formed a consortium-with diverse expertise and representation-representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens' values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, ICU resources, blood components, novel therapeutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were developed. Creating operational algorithms for each resource posed unique challenges; each resource's varying nature and underlying data on benefit prevented any single algorithm from being universally applicable. The development of scarce resource allocation processes must be iterative, legally vetted, and tested. We offer our processes to assist other regions that may be faced with the challenge of rationing health-care resources during public health catastrophes.","Ehmann, Michael R.","Zink, Elizabeth K.","Department of Emergency Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD"

Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal fatigue data were collected from September 2012 through April 2013 across clinics participating in the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). We analyzed data regarding psychometric characteristics including simulated computerized adaptive testing and differential item functioning, and regarding associations with clinical characteristics. Results: We analyzed data from 1597 PLWH. Fatigue was common in this cohort. Scores from the PROMIS® Fatigue Short Form and from the item bank had acceptable psychometric characteristics and strong evidence for validity, but neither performed better than shorter instruments already integrated in CNICS. Conclusions: The PROMIS® Fatigue Item Bank is a valid approach to measuring fatigue in clinical care settings among PLWH, but in our analyses did not perform better than instruments associated with less respondent burden.","Gibbons, L.

International Journal of Men's Health,2016,12,Picture Perfect Bodies: Visualizing Hegemonic Masculinities Produced for/by Male Fitness Spaces.,"This study examines hegemonic masculinity as both a motivator for and a product of body improvement within male body culture. Through photovoice methodology and multi-phase, in-depth qualitative interviews, 24 men who were actively pursuing muscularity and/or fitness captured what it meant to pursue the ideal male body. Using Foucault to situate the body as a theoretical construct, the results validate male body culture as a unique space for the production of masculine identities. These masculinities echo the traits of hegemonic masculinity, and are discussed in light of five distinct themes--(1) dominance and intimidation, (2) demanding respect, (3) weapons and violence, (4) social capital, and (5) sexual dominance. Results are discussed in light of Foucauldian readings of fitness, with regard to the potentials of photovoice for better understanding the complexities of identity formation and enactment within fitness spaces.","WAGNER, PHILLIP E.",,"Director of General Education and Chair of the Chancellor's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee"
International Journal of Inclusive Education,2009,6,"Data, data everywhere - but not all the numbers that count? Mapping alternative provisions for students excluded from school.","It is now mandatory for English schools to ensure that young people, under 16 years of age, who are excluded from school are placed in an education and training programme within 12 days. The programme must be at least half time, and should offer a meaningful and balanced curriculum. The Every Child Matters agenda also suggests that schools must coordinate services with other agencies to ensure that young people deemed 'at risk' are assisted to stay in mainstream schooling. Our research project examined the educational and training provisions for permanently excluded pupils, and young people likely to be permanently excluded, across two Midlands counties. The research focus - who gets what - is fundamental to questions of equity, access and participation. The findings suggest that, despite some very good local practices and highly skilled practitioners, there is a lack of coordinated data about which programmes exist and who attends, and a proliferation of programmes with varying funding sources, costs, entry practices, and qualifications. It is argued that this situation bodes poorly for monitoring and for ensuring the entitlement to education and training of those young people who are most marginalised by and through their schooling. However, we are concerned about the possibilities for further intensification of staff work and increased surveillance on young people if our recommendations for equity monitoring and better quality control were to go ahead.","Thomson, Pat","Russell, Lisa","Centre for Research in Equity and Diversity in Education, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK."
American Behavioral Scientist,2008,3,The Weakest Link: A Commentary on the Connections Between K-12 and Higher Education.,"Colleges and universities could be seen as being at the apex of a steep educational pyramid. Prospective entrants to the academy make their way up the pyramid by way of their experiences in elementary and secondary schools. Young people with financial means and social capital are likely to make it to the top of the pyramid with little difficulty. However, students of color, especially boys, are more likely to drop out, opt out, or be pushed out of school than they are to make a successful journey to the top. College and university presidents can help to change this situation by supporting precollege intervention programs on their campuses and in their communities. These programs can motivate and inspire students to pursue high academic achievement, and they help to establish a sense within these young people that attending college is an attainable goal, regardless of one's present social or financial circumstances.","Harvey, William B.",,"Vice president for diversity and equity and professor, Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, University of Virginia."

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 164 youths aged 11-18 years recruited in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that included measures of generic and weight-specific quality of life, perceived health, physical function, depressive symptoms, and body shape satisfaction. Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was determined. Fasting blood samples from participants yielded levels of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol (total, HDL, and LDL). Results: Nearly 50 % of participants were female, 21 % had a normal BMI, 39 % were overweight, and 40 % were obese. Obese youths reported significantly lower measures of perceived health status (PHS) and showed an increase in cardiometabolic risk, compared with normal weight youths. Physical functioning, generic and weight-specific QoL were inversely associated with BMI, waist circumference, and glucose. Depressive symptoms were positively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, glucose levels, and HDL cholesterol. No correlation was found between PHS and cardiometabolic risk measures after controlling for BMI. Conclusions: In this sample of Mexican youths, obesity was associated with a significantly lower PHS and increased cardiometabolic risk.","Flores, Yvonne","Shaibi, Gabriel","College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Arizona State University, Phoenix USA"

Journal of Gender Studies,2015,6,"Who is the ‘girly’ girl?

The research was a small-scale exploratory study of 20 women in the UK; data were collected in Yorkshire in the north of England and London in the south-east. The focus of the research was on the topic of tomboy identities. In this study, we explore the nuances and ambiguities around what a tomboy is by using an indirect (and perhaps unexpected) but nonetheless illuminating route: asking what constitutes a ‘girly-girl’, the polar opposite of the tomboy. We are interested in how she compares with the tomboy, and how the tomboy participants talked about her. We conclude that the girly-girl is a powerful cultural figure, part of a narrative in which women are sexualised and objectified but she is also a form of polemic; she is contrived to be a marker of the worst excesses of hegemonic ‘femininity’. It is through this lens that we can view and understand the tomboy, and the anxieties about the tomboy experienced by those around her.","Holland, Samantha","Harpin, Julie","Centre for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Leeds Metropolitan University, Headingley Campus, LeedsLS6 3QS, UK"
International Journal of Drug Policy,2023,1,Trust and service engagement among people who inject drugs after release from prison.,"• Trust influences service engagement, and can influence post-release experiences. • Service provider competence impacts on notions of trust, and can influence post-release experiences. • People who inject drugs are vulnerable to breaches of fidelity amid service engagement. • Reciprocal trust likely fosters honesty about client needs and enables self-advocacy and empowerment. • People who inject drugs experience stigma and discrimination following release from prison and impedes upon global trust. Compounding histories of injecting drug use and incarceration can marginalise people engaging with services, making it difficult for them to address their health and social welfare needs, particularly when they navigate community re-entry service supports. Drawing on Hall and colleagues' five components of trust, this paper seeks to understand how trust in service providers fosters (or inhibits) effective service engagement from the perspective of people who inject drugs during the prison post-release period. Between September 2018 and May 2020, qualitative in-depth interviews were completed with 48 adults (33 men, 15 women) recruited from SuperMIX (a longitudinal cohort study of people with a history of injection drug use in Victoria, Australia). Data relating to service engagement were coded against the five components of trust: competence, fidelity, honesty, global trust, and confidence. Reflections of post-release service engagement frequently focused on interactions with community corrections (parole) officers. Depictions of trust were consistently portrayed within the context of negative experiences and deficits, whereby trusting provider relationships and interactions were rarely described. Most participants recounted a stark absence of fidelity (that is, ""pursuing a [client's] best interests""), with some participants detailing circumstances in which their vulnerability was purposefully, almost strategically, exploited. These encounters nearly always had the consequence of impeding the participant's positive progression in the post-release integration period. There is an urgent need to prioritise the client in health and social service delivery in the post-release transition-to-community period and recognise the importance of trust in delivering effective services to people whose life histories make them highly vulnerable to marginalisation.","Lafferty, L.","Schroeder, S.","Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Level 1, Goodsell Building, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia"

Lancet Neurology,2020,6,Biological and clinical characteristics of gene carriers far from predicted onset in the Huntington's disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS): a cross-sectional analysis.,"<bold>Background: </bold>Disease-modifying treatments are in development for Huntington's disease; crucial to their success is to identify a timepoint in a patient's life when there is a measurable biomarker of early neurodegeneration while clinical function is still intact. We aimed to identify this timepoint in a novel cohort of young adult premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers (preHD) far from predicted clinical symptom onset.<bold>Methods: </bold>We did the Huntington's disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS) in the UK. We recruited young adults with preHD and controls matched for age, education, and sex to ensure each group had at least 60 participants with imaging data, accounting for scan fails. Controls either had a family history of Huntington's disease but a negative genetic test, or no known family history of Huntington's disease. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, including tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and a battery assessing emotion, motivation, impulsivity and social cognition (EMOTICOM). Imaging (done for all participants without contraindications) included volumetric MRI, diffusion imaging, and multiparametric mapping. Biofluid markers of neuronal health were examined using blood and CSF collection. We did a cross-sectional analysis using general least-squares linear models to assess group differences and associations with age and CAG length, relating to predicted years to clinical onset. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR), with FDR <0·05 deemed a significant result.<bold>Findings: </bold>Data were obtained between Aug 2, 2017, and April 25, 2019. We recruited 64 young adults with preHD and 67 controls. Mean ages of participants were 29·0 years (SD 5·6) and 29·1 years (5·7) in the preHD and control groups, respectively. We noted no significant evidence of cognitive or psychiatric impairment in preHD participants 23·6 years (SD 5·8) from predicted onset (FDR 0·22-0·87 for cognitive measures, 0·31-0·91 for neuropsychiatric measures). The preHD cohort had slightly smaller putamen volumes (FDR=0·03), but this did not appear to be closely related to predicted years to onset (FDR=0·54). There were no group differences in other brain imaging measures (FDR >0·16). CSF neurofilament light protein (NfL), plasma NfL, and CSF YKL-40 were elevated in this far-from-onset preHD cohort compared with controls (FDR<0·0001, =0·01, and =0·03, respectively). CSF NfL elevations were more likely in individuals closer to expected clinical onset (FDR <0·0001).<bold>Interpretation: </bold>We report normal brain function yet a rise in sensitive measures of neurodegeneration in a preHD cohort approximately 24 years from predicted clinical onset. CSF NfL appears to be a more sensitive measure than plasma NfL to monitor disease progression. This preHD cohort is one of the earliest yet studied, and our findings could be used to inform decisions about when to initiate a potential future intervention to delay or prevent further neurodegeneration while function is intact.<bold>Funding: </bold>Wellcome Trust, CHDI Foundation.","Scahill, Rachael I","Zeun, Paul","Huntington's Disease Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative disease, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK"

Western Journal of Emergency Medicine: Integrating Emergency Care with Population Health,2021,1,A Novel Approach to Neonatal Resuscitation Education for Senior Emergency Medicine Residents.,"The majority of pediatric visits occur in general emergency departments. Caring for critically ill neonates is a low-frequency but high-stakes event for emergency physicians, which requires specialized knowledge and hands-on training. We describe a novel clinical rotation for emergency medicine (EM) residents that specifically augments skills in neonatal resuscitation through direct participation as a member of the neonatal resuscitation team. The neonatal resuscitation rotation evaluation median score of 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 3,4) was higher compared to all other off-service senior resident rotations combined (median 3, IQR 3,4) for the academic year 2018-2019. Ninety-two percent of residents evaluated the curriculum change as beneficial (median 4, IQR 4,4). The neonatal resuscitation rotation was rated more favorably than the pediatric intensive care rotation (median 4 IQR 3,4 vs median 3, IQR 2, 3) at a tertiary care children's hospital during the third year. Residency programs may want to consider implementing a directed neonatal resuscitation experience as part of a comprehensive pediatric curriculum for EM residents.","Buchanan, Jennie A.","Hagan, Patricia","Denver Health & Hospital Authority, University of Colorado, Department of Emergency Medicine, Denver, Colorado."

This research utilized a repeated-measures mixed factorial design to examine the implicit and explicit effects of online diversity education delivered at a large public university during the course of a semester. The study design was informed by intergroup contact, social identity, and computer-mediated communication research. Findings contribute to theorizing about intergroup processes in the reception of and learning from diversity education and point to practical avenues for employing online diversity education in higher education.

Teaching & Learning in Medicine,2019,10,Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Clinical Grading in Medical School.,"Phenomenon: Performance during the clinical phase of medical school is associated with membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society, competitiveness for highly selective residency specialties, and career advancement. Although race/ethnicity has been found to be associated with clinical grades during medical school, it remains unclear whether other factors such as performance on standardized tests account for racial/ethnic differences in clinical grades. Identifying the root causes of grading disparities during the clinical phase of medical school is important because of its long-term impacts on the career advancement of students of color. Approach: To evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and clinical grading, we examined Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) summary words (Outstanding, Excellent, Very Good, Good) and 3rd-year clerkship grades among medical students at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The analysis included data from July 2010 to June 2015. Medical students were categorized as White, underrepresented minorities (URM), and non-URM minorities. Associations between MSPE summary words and clerkship grades with race/ethnicity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. Findings: Students who identified as White or female, students who were younger in age, and students with higher United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores or final clerkship written exam scores consistently received higher final clerkship grades. Non-URM minority students were more likely than White students (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.53), confidence interval [0.36, 0.76], p =.001, to receive a lower category MSPE summary word in analyses adjusting for student demographics (age, gender, maternal education), year, and United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores. Similarly, in four of six required clerkships, grading disparities (p <.05) were found to favor White students over either URM or non-URM minority students. In all analyses, after accounting for all available confounding variables, grading disparities favored White students. Insights: This single institution study is among the first to document racial/ethnic disparities in MSPE summary words and clerkship grades while accounting for clinical clerkship final written examinations. A national focus on grading disparities in medical school is needed to understand the scope of this problem and to identify causes and possible remedies.","Low, Daniel","Pollack, Samantha W.","Swedish Cherry Hill Family Medicine Residency, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, WA, USA"

Ultimately, it is through this subtle manipulation of interpretive poetics, memory work, and recollective labor that Sok and Lorde engender a new way of seeing the legacies of war and the ongoingness of conflict.","Schlund-Vials, Cathy J.",,Professor of English and Asian/Asian American studies at the University of Connecticut.

With close links to sport, a practice centrally implicated in the creation and maintenance of racialised bodies and hierarchies, Physical Education (PE) offers an important context for a study of whiteness and racism in education. Using collective biography we examine physical educators' narrative stories for what they reveal about the operation of whiteness and racism in PE. Teachers draw on narratives from curricula texts which uphold and reinforce notions of the racialised other, thereby reasserting normative, universal white knowledge. Their pedagogy is underpinned by a colour blind approach where race is 'not seen', yet essentialist and cultural discourses of race are nevertheless deployed to position particular racialised and gendered bodies as 'problems' in PE. Engagement with antiracism is limited to professional rhetoric within pedagogical practice.","Flintoff, Anne","Dowling, Fiona","Diversity Equity and Inclusion Research Centre, Carnegie School of Sport, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK"

Although the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sets forth guidelines for organizations to follow, questions remain about what counts as sexual harassment, and what is an organization's responsibility in maintaining a harassment-free workplace for its employees. At the invitation of the editor, seven organizational communication scholars responded to a series of questions addressing seven issues related to sexual harassment. These are: sexual harassment policy and training; the responsibilities of bystanders of sexual harassment; organizational culture that provides more support to the harasser than the harassed; the intersection of race with sexual harassment; same-sex harassment and female-to-male harassment; and what can be learned from public movements (e.g. #Metoo).

In this article, three program leaders detail how University Studies' Peer Mentor and Senior Capstone Programs and one recently revised diversity learning goal demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of taking high-impact practices to scale. This article used published assessments of the program, experiences by current program leaders, and interviews from faculty members and peer mentors. Overall, the coauthors conclude that three dynamic qualities contribute to a scaling up of its programs and curricular initiatives: (1) focus on University Studies' aspirational goals; (2) interplay between scaling up and scaling inward--acknowledging the agency of its teaching and learning community to address challenges and effect change; and (3) collaborative and engaged leadership. These findings suggest that, contrary to notions that running a program of this scale only addresses budgets and staffing needs, University Studies adapts to change because it built a dynamic and aspirational framework across its general education program.","FERNÁNDEZ, ÓSCAR","LUNDELL, DANA","faculty member in University Studies and serves as its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Coordinator"

"Sport, Education & Society",2018,5,The (in)visibility of gender knowledge in the Physical Activity and Sport Science degree in Spain.,"This paper draws on research that aimed to explore the construction of gender relations in sport and physical education (PE) through a national study of Spanish university degree curricula. Spain is a useful case study through which to explore gender knowledge within sport and PE degrees, because, unlike many other countries, it has a common, national curriculum framework for its Physical Activity and Sport Science (PASS) degrees. In addition, it has recently passed a new law concerning the introduction of gender knowledge in higher education (HE). Drawing on Bernstein’s (1990) framework of the pedagogic device, this paper examines how this HE gender policy becomes recontextualised as universities and lecturers interpret and translate this into the pedagogical texts that make up the PASS curricula. Purposive sampling was used to select 16 of the 37 universities offering PASS degrees in 2012/2013. The research analysed 16 PASS documents at the degree level and 763 individual subject handbooks. Using discourse analysis, the results showed where and how gender knowledge was incorporated and the extent to which the topic was presented coherently throughout the documents. The analysis revealed five categories of the (in)visibility of gender knowledge within the universities’ instructional discourse. Gender knowledge is largely ignored in PASS curricular documentation, appearing, at best, in highly superficial ways. Despite a national policy requirement on universities to incorporate gender knowledge, this study shows how recontextualisation processes within specific universities’ pedagogic devices operate to marginalise such perspectives within PASS curricula. The research also revealed the significance of individual agents committed to gender equity being situated, and having influence, throughout the pedagogic device. The paper concludes that without a much wider, critical engagement in knowledge about gender equity, PASS degrees will continue to reproduce rather than disrupt the gender relations that have traditionally characterised the field.","Serra, Pedrona","Soler, Susanna","National Institute of Physical Education (INEFC), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"
Journal of Affective Disorders,2018,5,Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.,"<bold>Background: </bold>Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters.<bold>Methods: </bold>Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response.<bold>Results: </bold>Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change.<bold>Limitations: </bold>Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","Niciu, Mark J.","Shovestul, Bridget J.","National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health, Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch, Building 10/CRC, 10 Center Dr., Unit 7 Southeast, Room 7-5342, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA"
"Sport, Education & Society",2018,1,A whitewashed curriculum? The construction of race in contemporary PE curriculum policy.,"Analyses of curricula in a range of countries show how they tend to reinforce, rather than challenge, popular theories of racism. To date, we know little about the contribution of physical education (PE) curriculum policy to the overall policy landscape. This paper examines the construction of race and racism in two national contexts (Norway and England) as a means of putting race and anti-racism on the PE policy research agenda. It adopts a critical whiteness perspective to analyse how whiteness, as a system of privilege, contributes to the racialisation of valued knowledge in PE and asks, who potentially benefits and/or is marginalised within the learning spaces available in the texts? The discourse analysis reveals that two discursive techniques of whiteness combine to privilege white, Eurocentric knowledge content. Unmarked white PE practices and students are constructed as universal, normative and contingent. As a result, non-white PE practices and students are positioned on the margins in contemporary policy texts. By revealing the racialisation processes evident in the texts, we aim to trouble the profession's taken-for-granted truths about race in PE as integral to working towards the development of an antiracist subject.","Dowling, Fiona","Flintoff, Anne","Department of Cultural and Social Studies, Norwegian School of Sports Sciences, Oslo, Norway"

Using Hecht's communication theory of identity, analysis of this data reveals that men pursuing fitness find misalignment between the personal, relational, and enacted frames. Consequently, they engage in a host of discursive strategies to manage the uncertainty that is produced by these identity gaps. This study identifies three: excessive body discipline, forceful negotiation, and constant comparison. By exploring these gaps and strategies, this study aims to situate fitness as a space ripe for the production of identity work and as an intersectional identity element.","Wagner, Phillip E.",,"Director of General Education, Core Curriculum Coordinator, and Chair of the Chancellor's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee."

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Hispanic and African American adults (n= 53) who take care of a child with asthma and live in an urban community of North Philadelphia. Input from community leaders was obtained in the development the survey tool resulting in a unique ‘community-centric’ questionnaire. The survey was also available in Spanish. All surveys were conducted in the community setting.Results: Variables were used to measure asthma severity and triggers. Children were categorized with intermittent (n= 24, 45.3%), mild persistent (n= 13, 24.5%), or moderate-to-severe persistent asthma (n= 16, 30.2%). Most children with persistent asthma were enrolled under Medicaid or CHIP (n= 24,p= 0.011) and reflected a low-income socioeconomic status. Persistent asthma was found to be associated with most triggers: pets, dust mites, mice, mold, and cockroaches. There was no significant association between environmental tobacco smoke and persistent asthma. Children with persistent asthma and 2 or more triggers were more likely to be hospitalized and go to the Emergency Department.Conclusion: Urban minority children living in low-income communities face neighborhood-specific asthma triggers and challenges to care. Studies conducted in urban neighborhoods, with collaboration from community members, will highlight the need of comprehensive services to account for community-centric social determinants.","Alicea-Alvarez, Norma","Foppiano Palacios, Carlo","Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"

Remote refill systems may provide an effective approach for improving medication non-adherence, but more research is needed among patients with limited English proficiency with poor access to remote refill systems.<bold>Objective: </bold>To compare the use of remote medication refill systems among limited-English-proficiency (LEP) and English-proficient (EP) patients with chronic conditions.<bold>Methods: </bold>Cross-sectional survey in six languages/dialects (English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, and Spanish) of 509 adults with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Primary study outcomes were self-reported use of 1) Internet refills, 2) telephone refills, and 3) any remote refill system. LEP was measured by patient self-identification of a primary language other than English and a claims record of use of an interpreter. Other measures were age, gender, education, years in the U.S., insurance, health status, chronic conditions, and number of prescribed medications. Analyses included multivariable logistic regression weighted for survey non-response.<bold>Results: </bold>Overall, 33.1 % of patients refilled their medications by telephone and 31.6 % by Internet. Among LEP patients (n = 328), 31.5 % refilled by telephone and 21.2 % by Internet, compared with 36.7 % by telephone and 52.7 % by Internet among EP patients (n = 181). Internet refill by language groups were as follows: English (52.7 %), Cantonese (34.9 %), Mandarin (17.4 %), Korean (16.7 %), Vietnamese (24.4 %), and Spanish (12.6 %). Compared to EP patients, LEP patients had lower use of any remote refill system (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.18; p < 0.001), CONCLUSIONS: LEP patients are significantly less likely than EP patients to use any remote medication refill system. Increased reliance on current systems for remote medication refills may increase disparities in health outcomes affecting LEP patients with poor access to telephone and Internet medication refills.","Moreno, Gerardo","Lin, Elizabeth","UCLA Department of Family Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, 10880 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1800 Los Angeles 90024 USA"

Physical Education & Sport Pedagogy,2015,9,"Working through whiteness , race and (anti) racism in physical education teacher education.","Background: The persistent gaps between a largely white profession and ethnically diverse school populations have brought renewed calls to support teachers' critical engagement with race. Programmes examining the effects of racism have had limited impact on practice, with student teachers responding with either denial, guilt or fear; they also contribute to a deficit view of racialised students in relation to an accepted white ‘norm’, and position white teachers ‘outside’ of race. Recent calls argue for a shift in focus towards an examination of the workings of the dominant culture through a critical engagement with whiteness, positioning white teachers within the processes of racialisation. Teacher educators' roles are central, and yet, while we routinely expect student teachers to reflect critically on issues of social justice, we have been less willing to engage in such work ourselves. This is particularly the case within physical education teacher education (PETE), an overwhelmingly white, embodied space, and where race and racism as professional issues are largely invisible. Purpose: This paper examines the operation of whiteness within PETE through a critical reflection on the three co-authors' careers and experiences working for social justice. The research questions were twofold: How are race, (anti) racism and whiteness constructed through everyday experiences of families, schooling and teacher education? How can collective biography be used to excavate discourses of race, racism and whiteness as the first step towards challenging them? In beginning the process of reflecting on what it means for us ‘to do own work’ in relation to (anti) racism, we examine some of the tensions and challenges for teacher educators in PE attempting to work to dismantle whiteness. Methodology: As co-authors, we engaged in collective biography work – a process in which we reflected upon, wrote about and shared our embodied experiences and memories about race, racism and whiteness as educators working for social justice. Using a critical whiteness lens, these narratives were examined for what they reveal about the collective practices and discourses about whiteness and (anti)racism within PETE. Results: The narratives reveal the ways in which whiteness operates within PETE through processes of naturalisation, ex-denomination and universalisation. We have been educated, and now work within, teacher education contexts where professional discourse about race at best focuses on understanding the racialised ‘other’, and at worse is invisible. By drawing on a ‘racialised other’, deficit discourse in our pedagogy, and by ignoring race in own research on inequalities in PETE, we have failed to disrupt universalised discourses of ‘white-as-norm’, or addressed our own privileged racialised positioning. Reflecting critically on our biographies and careers has been the first step in recognising how whiteness works in order that we can begin to work to disrupt it. Conclusion: The study highlights some of the challenges of addressing (anti)racism within PETE and argues that a focus on whiteness might offer a productive starting point. White teacher educators must critically examine their own role within these processes if they are to expect student teachers to engage seriously in doing the same.","Flintoff, Anne","Dowling, Fiona","Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Research Centre, Leeds Metropolitan University, Fairfax Hall, Headingley Campus, LeedsLS6 3QH, UK"
Crisis (15591573),2018,10,Shirley Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.,"The article focuses on American Politician Shirley Chisholm who broke race and gender barriers as the first Black woman elected to Congress in 1968. It mentions she challenged the Democratic Party to become more inclusive well before the party established itself as welcoming to women, racial minorities and other marginalized groups. It also mentions Chisholm helping to found the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional caucus on Women's Issues.","Smooth, Wendy",,"Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer for the College of Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State University"

"Sport, Education & Society",2015,3,Playing the ‘Race’ card? Black and minority ethnic students' experiences of physical education teacher education.,"This paper reports on a study that explored black and minority ethnic (BME) students' experiences of physical education teacher education (PETE) in England. Widening the ethnic diversity of those choosing to enter the teaching profession has been a key policy objective of the Training and Development Agency—the government agency responsible for teacher education—for some years. However PETE programmes, designed to produce specialist physical education (PE) teachers to work with secondary age (11–18 years) pupils, reveal significant and enduring levels of under-representation of BME candidates, compared to other subject specialisms. The study reported here used semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 25 BME participants from five universities involved in PETE in England. The findings show that BME PETE students share many of the characteristics with their White counterparts, being young, sporty and with a desire to improve PE experiences for future generations. However, in other ways, their experiences reveal the significance of ‘race’ ethnicity, and religion and how these are interwoven with gender to position them as ‘other’ in PETE spaces and within schools. Skin colour and religious dress were significant to stereotyping and everyday interactions that served to position them as ‘out of place’, particularly evident in practical activity sessions and on teaching placements. ‘Race’ and ethnicity as part of their professional education was at best a marginalised discourse, at worse, reproduced a deficit perspective of BME pupils’ and their schooling. The paper concludes by arguing for a critical analysis of the construction of Whiteness through PETE.","Flintoff, Anne",,"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Research Centre, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, UK"
Journal of Homosexuality,2015,3,From Navigation to Negotiation: An Examination of the Lived Experiences of Black Gay Male Alumni of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.,"This research presents an examination of Black gay men and their lived experiences while undergraduates at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Based on 10 in-depth interviews with self-identified Black gay men, the author presents four emergent themes, which reveal the complex ways in which Black gay men navigate and negotiate the intersections of their multiple identities as related to race, sexual orientation, and gender at HBCUs. The findings of this research have implications for larger discussions of community, Black masculinity, and gay identity in predominantly Black and non-Black contexts.","Ford III, Obie",,"The Office of Inclusion, Diversity, & Equity, Warren Wilson College, Asheville, North Carolina, USA"
"Race, Ethnicity & Education",2014,6,Tales from the playing field: black and minority ethnic students’ experiences of physical education teacher education.,"This article presents findings from recent research exploring black and minority ethnic (BME) students’ experiences of Physical Education teacher education (PETE) in England (Flintoff, 2008). Despite policy initiatives to increase the ethnic diversity of teacher education cohorts, BME students are under-represented in PETE, making up just 2.94% of the 2007/8 national cohort, the year in which this research was conducted. Drawing on in-depth interviews and questionnaires with 25 BME students in PETE, the study sought to contribute to our limited knowledge and understanding of racial and ethnic difference in PE, and to show how ‘race,’ ethnicity and gender are interwoven in individuals’ embodied, everyday experiences of learning how to teach. In the article, two narratives in the form of fictional stories are used to present the findings. I suggest that narratives can be useful for engaging with the experiences of those previously silenced or ignored within Physical Education (PE); they are also designed to provoke an emotional as well as an intellectual response in the reader. Given that teacher education is a place where we should be engaging students, emotionally and politically, to think deeply about teaching, education and social justice and their place within these, I suggest that such stories of difference might have a useful place within a critical PETE pedagogy.","Flintoff, A.",,"Department of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Research Centre, Carnegie Faculty, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, England"

International Studies in Sociology of Education,2008,7,The challenges of intersectionality: researching difference in physical education.,"Researching the intersection of class, race, gender, sexuality and disability raises many issues for educational research. Indeed, Maynard (2002, 33) has recently argued that 'difference is one of the most significant, yet unresolved, issues for feminist and social thinking at the beginning of the twentieth century'. This paper reviews some of the key imperatives of working with 'intersectional theory' and explores the extent to these debates are informing research around difference in education and Physical Education (PE). The first part of the paper highlights some key issues in theorising and researching intersectionality before moving on to consider how difference has been addressed within PE. The paper then considers three ongoing challenges of intersectionality - bodies and embodiment, politics and practice and empirical research. The paper argues for a continued focus on the specific context of PE within education for its contribution to these questions.","Flintoff, A.","Fitzgerald, H.","Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Research Centre, Carnegie Research Institute, Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, England"
Religions,2019,5,Transformational Ethics: The Concept of Obedience in Post-Conciliar Jesuit Thinking.,"The paper sheds light on the change in the concept of obedience within the Society of Jesus since the 1960s. In the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, a so-called crisis of authority and obedience took place in the Catholic Church and the religious orders. As a consequence, the notions of responsibility and conscience came to the fore in the Jesuit definition of obedience. The religious concept of obedience, that is the obedience towards God, was reassessed as a service to humanity. The paper analyzes how the change in the concept of obedience gave rise to the promotion of social justice, which the Society of Jesus proclaimed at General Congregation 32 in 1974/75. By including the promotion of social justice into their central mission, Jesuits not only fundamentally transformed their self-conception, but also their ethical values. The paper argues that the pursuit of social justice became a form of religious obedience.","Schnoor, Antje",,"Department of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Hochschule Hannover (HsH), Bismarckstraße 2, 30173 Hannover, Germany"
