BMC medical education,2023,3,Moving beyond inquiry: a secondary qualitative analysis on promoting racial justice in clinical care.,"Background: Anti-Black racism is prevalent in medicine, and anti-racism training is needed in medical education. One such training is the Presence 5 for Racial Justice (P5RJ) Curriculum which covers evidence-based anti-racism communication strategies that promote health equity for Black patients. The P5RJ Curriculum was developed using feedback from clinicians and trainees with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) experience. In this study, we identify themes in recommended anti-racism language and phrases that surveyed clinicians and trainees use to promote racial justice and health equity in clinical care for Black patients. Methods: Secondary analysis of survey responses to identify themes in qualitative data. Dataset: Survey responses of specific phrases for anti-racism communication based on P5RJ Curriculum feedback. Population studied: N = 50 respondents (27 clinicians, 17 medical trainees, 6 unreported) recruited through convenience sampling and listservs of clinicians with DEI experience. An inductive qualitative analysis was performed on survey responses to identify emerging themes. Results: Emerging themes from survey responses reflected four communication practices: ""Inquiry"" was the predominant practice (59%), followed by ""Empathy"" (25%), ""Statements of Allyship"" (9%), and ""Self-Accountability"" (8%). Conclusion: Inquiry and empathy may be predominant communication practices when addressing anti-Black racism in medicine. There is an opportunity to expand anti-racism communication tools with statements of self-accountability and allyship. Future research is necessary to analyze the patient voice on clinician communication practices that promote anti-racism in clinical care.","Kyerematen, Baffour"

International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,3,Twelve Tips for Inclusive Practice in Healthcare Settings.,"This paper outlines practical tips for inclusive healthcare practice and service delivery, covering diversity aspects and intersectionality. A team with wide-ranging lived experiences from a national public health association's diversity, equity, and inclusion group compiled the tips, which were reiteratively discussed and refined. The final twelve tips were selected for practical and broad applicability. The twelve chosen tips are: (a) beware of assumptions and stereotypes, (b) replace labels with appropriate terminology, (c) use inclusive language, (d) ensure inclusivity in physical space, (e) use inclusive signage, (f) ensure appropriate communication methods, (g) adopt a strength-based approach, (h) ensure inclusivity in research, (i) expand the scope of inclusive healthcare delivery, (j) advocate for inclusivity, (k) self-educate on diversity in all its forms, and (l) build individual and institutional commitments. The twelve tips are applicable across many aspects of diversity, providing a practical guide for all healthcare workers (HCWs) and students to improve practices. These tips guide healthcare facilities and HCWs in improving patient-centered care, especially for those who are often overlooked in mainstream service provision.",Marjadi B

Accounting for one-third of the senior population, these immigrants face unique challenges, including a lack of programming, language, socioeconomic and transportation barriers hindering societal integration, health, and well-being. Objective: This study uses a phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of immigrant seniors transitioning to Canadian society by considering their diversity of food knowledge and experiences. Method: Five immigrant seniors who could communicate in English in some capacities were recruited through social media, community organizations, and snowball sampling to participate in an interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were independently coded by the primary investigator and discussed with and verified by a second researcher to establish final themes and subthemes. Results: Participants represented different ethnic and demographic backgrounds. Participants identified several influences that shaped their experiences and identity as an immigrant senior. Three key themes emerged: Embracing change while preserving self; Food knowledge and experiences as an avenue for storytelling and; Identity and significant life changes as an immigrant senior. Conclusion: The experiences of immigrant seniors are a complex and multifaceted phenomenon manifesting in various ways. Habits, norms, and adaptations to novel circumstances are instrumental to these seniors' overall well-being and integration into a new environment. Significance: Food experiences may serve as a medium for understanding, coping with, and sharing differences within new cultural contexts. This medium may provide opportunities for dietitians and others to advance equity and inclusion of immigrant seniors in Canadian society. Funded by: None","Hickens, N."
Psychological Reports,2022,11,Validation of the Revised Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI-r) in the UK.,"As worldwide migration continues to grow, valid and reliable instruments are needed to assess the psychological processes that influence the successful management of intercultural relations in different sociopolitical contexts. In this study, we test whether the original Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI) required a revision to remain ‘fit for purpose’ in the current culturally plural context of the UK (MCI-r). Specifically, six subscales are proposed to underlie the construct of a multicultural ideology: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. With data from 300 UK nationals, we tested the psychometric properties of the MCI-r using various confirmatory factor analysis techniques to estimate the scale’s factor structure followed by convergent and discriminant validity tests. The results indicated that a 4-factor solution (Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity) fitted the data best. All four subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity. All four subscales were also negatively correlated with a right-wing political orientation, whilst especially Social Interaction and Consequences of Diversity were positively associated with intergroup contact frequency across domains (work, family and friends and/or acquaintances). Finally, UK participants with personal migratory experiences reported a stronger belief in positive consequences of multiculturalism and more support for Social Interactions between members of different ethnic groups. Overall, findings provide first insights into the applicability of the MCI-r as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of multiculturalism within the present UK context.",

PLoS biology,2022,10,Five actionable pillars to engage the next generation of leaders in the co-design of transformative ocean solutions.,"Solutions to complex and unprecedented global challenges are urgently needed. Overcoming these challenges requires input and innovative solutions from all experts, including Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs). To achieve diverse inclusion from ECOPs, fundamental changes must occur at all levels-from individuals to organizations. Drawing on insights from across the globe, we propose 5 actionable pillars that support the engagement of ECOPs in co-design processes that address ocean sustainability: sharing knowledge through networks and mentorship, providing cross-boundary training and opportunities, incentivizing and celebrating knowledge co-design, creating inclusive and participatory governance structures, and catalyzing culture change for inclusivity. Foundational to all actions are the cross-cutting principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusivity. In addition, the pillars are cross-boundary in nature, including collaboration and innovation across sectors, disciplines, regions, generations, and backgrounds. Together, these recommendations provide an actionable and iterative path toward inclusive engagement and intergenerational exchange that can develop ocean solutions for a sustainable future.",Satterthwaite EV
BMC medical education,2022,10,"Towards a common lexicon for equity, diversity, and inclusion work in academic medicine.","Differential rewarding of work and experience has been a longtime feature of academic medicine, resulting in a series of academic disparities. These disparities have been collectively called a cultural or minority ""tax,"" and, when considered beyond academic medicine, exist across all departments, colleges, and schools of institutions of higher learning-from health sciences to disciplines located on university campuses outside of medicine and health. A shared language can provide opportunities for those who champion this work to pool resources for larger impacts across the institution. This article aims to catalog the terms used across academic medicine disciplines to establish a common language describing the inequities experienced by Black, Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Women, and other underrepresented people as well as queer, disabled, and other historically marginalized or excluded groups. These ideas are specific to academic medicine in the United States, although many can be used in academic medicine in other countries. The terms were selected by a team of experts in equity, diversity, and inclusion, (EDI) who are considered national thought leaders in EDI and collectively have over 100 years of scholarship and experience in this area.",Rodríguez JE

Integrative and comparative biology,2023,5,"Deficits in Accessibility Across Field Research Stations for Scientists with Disabilities And/Or Chronic Illness, And Proposed Solutions.","Equity and inclusivity in STEM research has become a larger topic of discussion in recent years, however researchers and scientists with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses are often missing from these conversations. Further, while field research is a major research component for some STEM disciplines, it is unclear what accessibility barriers or accommodations exist across the field sciences. Field research can sometimes involve harsh environments, topography, and weather, that present challenges to those with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses. A large and coinciding obstacle standing in the way of field research accessibility is the ableism present across science and academia, resulting in and from a lack of prioritization of attention and funding from universities and institutions. Biological field stations have been shown to be valuable not only as infrastructure for field-based research, but also as providing resources towards the scientific education of students and scientific outreach initiatives for the general public. As such, biological field stations are perfectly positioned to reduce barriers in research inclusion and accessibility for students and scientists with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses. The current work presents the results of a survey meant to inventory the presence or absence of accessible infrastructure across field stations, with responses spanning 6 countries and 24 USA states. Our results highlight a number of accessibility deficits, in areas such as accessible entrances, kitchens, and bathrooms. Our results suggest that (1) biological field stations have significant variability in accessibility with significant deficits especially in non-public-facing buildings used primarily by staff and researchers, and (2) field stations would benefit from an increase in federal funding opportunities to expedite their progress towards compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. We propose potential solutions to field work infrastructure spanning a range of financial costs, with emphasis on the point that efforts towards accessibility do not require an ""all or nothing"" approach, and that any step towards accessibility will make field stations more inclusive. Additionally, we further suggest that federal funding sources, such as the NSF and NIH, as well as university leadership, should consider broadening diversity initiatives to promote the continuation of, and increased accessibility of, university-affiliated field stations.",Rudzki EN

This study aims to understand the ways in which both training directors and fellows in neuropsychology training programs understand, perceive, communicate about, and plan for personal leaves during fellowship training. We also aim to provide empirically based recommendations for training directors communicating with fellows about personal leaves. Method: Training directors ( N  = 40) and postdoctoral fellows ( N  = 51) were recruited to complete surveys examining their knowledge and perspectives on personal leaves through a professional listserv. Results: While most training directors reported that their programs offer paid personal leave options, a substantial minority did not. There were discrepancies between training directors' and fellows' knowledge about leave policies and perceptions of the professional implications of taking a personal leave, such that fellows reported less knowledge and a greater perception that taking a leave during training may have a negative professional impact. Conclusions: Findings suggest that training directors in neuropsychology should clearly communicate institutional leave policies early in, or even before the start of, the fellowship period and work to cultivate a culture of openness around both broad issues of work-life balance and specific issues related to personal leaves with trainees.",Shapiro DN

Brain stimulation,2023,4,"Toward more diverse, inclusive, and equitable neuromodulation.","Racial and ethnic disparities exist for many nervous system disorders that are intervention targets for neuromodulation investigators. Yet, to date, there has been both a lack of racial and ethnic diversity and a lack of emphasis on diversity in neuromodulation research. In this paper, we suggest three potential reasons for the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in neuromodulation research: 1) the lack of diversity in the neuromodulation workforce, 2) incompatibility between the technologies employed and phenotypic traits (e.g., hair texture) commonly present in minoritized populations, and 3) minoritized populations' reluctance to participate in clinical trials. We argue that increasing diversity in the neuromodulation workforce, in conjunction with mutual collaboration between current neuromodulation researchers and underrepresented communities in neuromodulation, can aid in removing barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuromodulation research. This is important, because greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in neuromodulation research brings with it the development of novel, yet safe and effective, treatment approaches for brain disorders and enhances the rigor and generalizability of discoveries in the field.",Peebles IS

This perspective provides a classification of racism at 3 levels-individual, organizational, and structural-and offers recommendations for future research, practice, and policy. Our recommendations include the need to capture and use structural measures of social determinants of health to address structural racism, intersectionality as a theoretical framework for research, structural competency training, research on the role of prejudice and stereotyping in stigmatizing documentation in EHRs, and actions to increase the diversity of private sector informatics workforce and participation of minority scholars in specialty groups.

Enrollment data was stratified by race and ethnicity. Cochran-Armitage Trend tests were used to examine changes in Black patient participation over years. Nine clinical trials were identified that led to FDA approval of 5 novel molecular entities for prostate and 4 molecular entities for urothelial carcinoma treatment. Trials for prostate cancer included 5202 participants of which 69.8% were White, 4.0% Black, 11.0% Asian, 3.6% Hispanic, <1% American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 3% other.

PeerJ,2023,4,Overcoming the gender bias in ecology and evolution: is the double-anonymized peer review an effective pathway over time?,"Male researchers dominate scientific production in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, potential mechanisms to avoid this gender imbalance remain poorly explored in STEM, including ecology and evolution areas. In the last decades, changes in the peer-review process towards double-anonymized (DA) have increased among ecology and evolution (EcoEvo) journals. Using comprehensive data on articles from 18 selected EcoEvo journals with an impact factor >1, we tested the effect of the DA peer-review process in female-leading ( i.e ., first and senior authors) articles. We tested whether the representation of female-leading authors differs between double and single-anonymized (SA) peer-reviewed journals. Also, we tested if the adoption of the DA by previous SA journals has increased the representativeness of female-leading authors over time. We found that publications led by female authors did not differ between DA and SA journals. Moreover, female-leading articles did not increase after changes from SA to DA peer-review. Tackling female underrepresentation in science is a complex task requiring many interventions. Still, our results highlight that adopting the DA peer-review system alone could be insufficient in fostering gender equality in EcoEvo scientific publications. Ecologists and evolutionists understand how diversity is important to ecosystems' resilience in facing environmental changes. The question remaining is: why is it so difficult to promote and keep this ""diversity"" in addition to equity and inclusion in the academic environment? We thus argue that all scientists, mentors, and research centers must be engaged in promoting solutions to gender bias by fostering diversity, inclusion, and affirmative measures.",Cássia-Silva C

This article reviews the current literature on grit in medicine and summarises the current research on grit and performance metrics, personality characteristics, longitudinal progression, psychological well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, burnout and residency attrition. While there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of grit on performance metrics in medicine, research consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between grit and psychological well-being and a negative correlation between grit and burnout. After discussing some of the inherent limitations of this type of research, this article suggests some possible implications and future areas for research and their potential role in cultivating psychologically healthy physicians and promoting successful careers in medicine.",Lee DH
Frontiers in human neuroscience,2023,4,Mind the gender gap: The social neuroscience of belonging.,"Gender gaps persist in the 21st century, in many aspects of society and in many types of organisation. There are earnings gaps in almost all domains, reports of glass ceilings and the ""missing middle"" in business, finance, law and politics, and dramatic under-representation of women in many branches of science, even in the most ""gender equal"" countries. This is despite decades of effort to address them, including targeted legislation and many Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. Early essentialist, competence-based explanations for the existence of gender gaps have been largely discredited at the research level, although their persistence in the public consciousness and at the level of education and training can still negatively bias both individual self-belief and organisational processes. Contemporary essentialist explanations are now emerging, with claims that such gaps are the manifestations of the presence or absence of endogenous, brain-based characteristics underpinning career progression or career preferences. The focus remains on the individual as the source of gender imbalances. Less attention has been paid to the contextual aspects of organisations where gender gaps are evident, to inclusion (or the lack of it), or the availability of unbiased reward and progression pathways. Advances in 21st century social cognitive neuroscience are revealing the importance of external organisational processes as powerful brain-changing forces, with their potentially negative impact on self-belief and a sense of belonging. Key research is demonstrating the cortical and behavioural consequences of negative social experiences, with the activation of core inhibitory pathways associated with low self-esteem, lack of engagement, and eventual withdrawal. This paper will argue that reference to such research will provide better explanations for the persistence of gender gaps, and offer evidence-based insights into addressing gender gap issues. Importantly, this is not a rejection of an endogenous, brain-based explanation for gender gaps but the elaboration of a better-informed 21st century model, flagging up the need to take factors such as cultural stereotyping and organisational bias into account in any drive toward true gender equity, or genuinely levelled playing fields.",Rippon G
Accounts of chemical research,2023,4,Discipline-Based Diversity Research in Chemistry.,"ConspectusWe introduce the term discipline-based diversity research (DBDR) to capture the emerging field of research advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging with specificity to a given discipline. Contextualizing a human dynamic through a disciplinary lens has already given rise to discipline-based education research (DBER). The modalities through which students and practitioners think and process information are a reflection of a given discipline, and it tends to give rise to its professional practices. Through DBER, such specification is necessary in addressing evidence-based practices that are effective for teaching a particular subject. Likewise, the inequities and opportunities within a given field (and its professional culture) must be addressed within a disciplinary lens. Thus, the findings from social science in diversity in arbitrary contexts must be analyzed, interpreted, applied, and researched within a given discipline.One specific challenge to academic chemistry is the lack of inclusion in the sense that the faculties in research-active chemistry departments are far from diverse. We recapitulate the percentage of women and under-represented person of color (URPOC) professors over the past 20 years reported by us and other sources. The data admits to linear fits with high confidence. Assuming this linearity holds, the gender gap in representation would be bridged only in 2062, and the threshold of 20% of the faculty as URPOC would be reached only in 2113. While the community has actively engaged in modifying practices and procedures to redress this grim projection, it should be clear that more needs to be done.Toward this objective, we have been driven by the top-down hypothesis that solutions must be led intentionally through the top─that is, by department heads and chairs─because they are the stewards of the infrastructure. Department chairs and the chemistry community have engaged in DBDR through biennial workshops─that is, through the Open Chemistry Collaborative in Diversity Equity (OXIDE)'s National Diversity Equity Workshops (NDEWs)─to survey and evaluate existing policies and practices aimed at advancing inclusive excellence. This has led to research-based recommendations for the implementation of solutions in chemistry departments. This includes (i) engaging in community, (ii) conducting authentic and open searches, and (iii) recognizing and rewarding inclusive excellence. What makes them DBDR in chemistry is that we have to articulate and contextualize these solutions in terms of practices and procedures that we conduct in chemistry, assess their efficacy, and promote them across our discipline. Furthermore, we must offer theories of change for reforming them while offering frameworks that fit within how chemists think and practice.In this Account, we demonstrate how DBDR has taken root in chemistry, forecast where this emerging field may go, and provide a blueprint for how it might be replicated in other disciplines.",Hernandez R

Pediatrics,2023,4,"Faculty Perspectives on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Building a Foundation for Pediatrics.","Pediatric departments and children's hospitals (hereafter pediatric academic settings) increasingly promote the tenets of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as guiding principles to shape the mission areas of clinical care, education, research, and advocacy. Integrating DEI across these domains has the potential to advance health equity and workforce diversity. Historically, initiatives toward DEI have been fragmented with efforts predominantly led by individual faculty or subgroups of faculty with little institutional investment or strategic guidance. In many instances, there is a lack of understanding or consensus regarding what constitutes DEI activities, who engages in DEI activities, how faculty feel about their engagement, and what is an appropriate level of support. Concerns also exist that DEI work falls disproportionately to racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in medicine, exacerbating what is termed the minority tax. Despite these concerns, current literature lacks quantitative data characterizing such efforts and their potential impact on the minority tax. As pediatric academic settings invest in DEI programs and leadership roles, there is imperative to develop and use tools that can survey faculty perspectives, assess efforts, and align DEI efforts between academic faculty and health systems. Our exploratory assessment among academic pediatric faculty demonstrates that much of the DEI work in pediatric academic settings is done by a small number of individuals, predominantly Black faculty, with limited institutional support or recognition. Future efforts should focus on expanding participation among all groups and increasing institutional engagement.",Raphael JL

Journal of biomechanics,2023,4,Increasing accessibility to biomechanics for Black students with early exposure through NBD.,"From the perspective of a Black woman in the biomechanics field, it is my observation that many Black biomechanists are exposed to the field of biomechanics late into their academic careers. STEM (science, technology, and mathematics) is such a broad/encompassing field, yet students are only typically given a narrow introduction to biology and chemistry prior to college. These basic science courses are not enough to continue recruiting and building a pathway for future scientists to pursue STEM careers in the interdisciplinary field of biomechanics. Outreach programs, like National Biomechanics Day (NBD), can expose students to biomechanics earlier than the usual undergraduate exposure for those majoring in health/exercise science, kinesiology, or biomedical/mechanical engineering. NBD has increased accessibility to biomechanics, which has led to increases in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomechanics community, particularly for young Black students. Outreach programs like NBD are crucial to reaching, engaging, and recruiting future young Black biomechanists, and others from underrepresented communities, within the US and beyond.",Bell EA
Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2023,4,"Detect, predict, and prevent acute seizures and status epilepticus.","Status epilepticus is one of the most frequent pediatric neurological emergencies. While etiology is often influencing the outcome, more easily modifiable risk factors of outcome include detection of prolonged convulsive seizures and status epilepticus and appropriately dosed and timely applied medication treatment. Unpredictability and delayed or incomplete treatment may at times lead to longer seizures, thereby affecting outcomes. Barriers in the care of acute seizures and status epilepticus include the identification of patients at greatest risk of convulsive status epilepticus, potential stigma, distrust, and uncertainties in acute seizure care, including caregivers, physicians, and patients. Furthermore, unpredictability, detection capability, and identification of acute seizures and status epilepticus, limitations in access to obtaining and maintaining appropriate treatment, and rescue treatment options pose challenges. Additionally, timing and dosing of treatment and related acute management algorithms, potential variations in care due to healthcare and physician culture and preference, and factors related to access, equity, diversity, and inclusion of care.

This prompted discussions of root cause analyses for differences in health outcomes among historically underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minorities. Dismantling structural racism in medicine is an ambitious goal that requires widespread buy-in and transdisciplinary collaborations across institutions to establish systematic, rigorous approaches that enable sustainable change. Radiology is at the center of medical care and renewed focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) provides an opportune window for radiologists to facilitate an open forum to address racialized medicine to catalyze real and lasting change. The framework of change management can help radiology practices create and maintain this change while minimizing disruption.

To do so, it is essential to define quality in genetic counseling and identify opportunities for improvement. This Professional Issues article provides an overview of the evaluation of healthcare quality in genetic counseling. The National Society of Genetic Counselors' Research, Quality, and Outcomes Committee partnered with Discern Health, a value-based healthcare policy consulting firm, to develop a care continuum model of genetic counseling. Using the proposed model, currently available quality measures relevant to genetic counseling in the US healthcare system were assessed, allowing for the identification of gaps and priority areas for further development. A total of 560 quality measures were identified that can be applied to various aspects of the care continuum model across a range of clinical specialty areas in genetic counseling, although few measures were specific to genetic counseling or genetic conditions. Areas where quality measures were lacking included: attitudes toward genetic testing, family communication, stigma, and issues of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We discuss these findings and other strategies for an evidence-based approach to quality in genetic counseling. Strategic directions for the genetic counseling profession should include a consolidated approach to research on quality and value of genetic counseling, development of quality metrics and patient-experience measures, and engagement with other improvement activities. These strategies will allow for benchmarking, performance improvement, and future implementation in accountability programs which will strengthen genetic counseling as a profession that provides evidence-based high-quality care to all patients.",Higgs E

In colleges of pharmacy, DEI committees can play a crucial role in promoting a culture change to ensure pharmacy graduates are equipped to provide equitable and representative care for the patients they serve. There is limited literature available on DEI committee composition, roles, and responsibilities, and their place within a college of pharmacy's organizational structure. A commitment to DEI should be part of the college's strategic plan and embedded and supported at all levels of the college and university to ensure success of DEI-related strategic initiatives. For a DEI committee to be effective, its composition should be intentional to include change agents, campus leaders, and members who are passionate and knowledgeable to execute the DEI goals.

Adding a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic to these elements created a perfect storm that perpetuated extreme inequalities. The crisis negatively impacted Latin-American women, and economic recession in our region was one of the main consequences, resulting in women compared with men having higher rates of poverty, poorer access to and experience of healthcare, a wider gender gap, and adverse effects on well-being. This consequently made women more vulnerable.

This opinion piece aims to address the gaps in the literature regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in trauma and acute care surgery and highlight the issues related to the workforce, gender gap, patient outcomes, and health services. To effectively guide DEI interventions, it is essential to capture patient-reported experience data and stratify outcomes by factors including race, ethnicity, ancestry, language, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Only then can generalizable findings effectively inform DEI strategies. Using validated measurement tools, it is essential to conduct these assessments with methodological rigor. Collaboration between healthcare institutions can also provide valuable insights into effective and ineffective intervention practices through information exchange and constructive feedback.

Neurology,2023,3,Neurology Education in 2035: The Neurology Future Forecasting Series.,"In the past decade, there have been dramatic changes in all aspects of neurologic care, and along with this, neurology education has transformed. These changes have affected all aspects of education across the educational continuum, including learners, teachers, educators, content, delivery methods, assessments, and outcomes. Health systems science, health humanities, diversity, equity, and inclusion and health disparities are becoming core components of neurology curricula, and, in the future, will be integrated into every aspect of our educational mission. The ways in which material is taught and learned have been influenced by technologic innovations and a growing understanding of the science of learning. We forecast that this trend will continue, with learners choosing from an array of electronic resources to engage with fundamental topics, allowing front-line clinical teachers to spend more time supporting critical reasoning and teaching students how to learn. There has been a growing differentiation of educational roles (i.e., teachers, educators, and scholars). We forecast that these roles will become more distinct, each with an individualized pattern of support and expectations. Assessment has become more aligned with the work of the learners, and there are growing calls to focus more on the impact of educational programs on patient care. We forecast that there will be an increased emphasis on educational outcomes and public accountability for training programs. In this article, we reflect on the history of medical education in neurology and explore the current state to forecast the future of neurology education and discuss ways in which we can prepare.",Moeller J
Advanced biology,2023,3,Toward Inclusivity in Preclinical Drug Development: A Proposition to Start with Intestinal Organoids.,"Representation of humans from diverse backgrounds in the drug development process is key to advancing health equity, and while clinical trial design has recently made strides toward greater inclusivity, preclinical drug development has struggled to make those same gains. One barrier to inclusion is the current lack of robust and established in vitro model systems that simultaneously capture the complexity of human tissues while representing patient diversity. Here, the use of primary human intestinal organoids as a mechanism to advance inclusive preclinical research is proposed. This in vitro model system not only recapitulates tissue functions and disease states, but also retains the genetic identity and epigenetic signatures of the donors from which they are derived. Thus, intestinal organoids are an ideal in vitro prototype for capturing human diversity. In this perspective, the authors call for an industry-wide effort to leverage intestinal organoids as a starting point to actively and intentionally incorporate diversity into preclinical drug programs.",Co JY

Working arrangements have been fundamentally transformed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with potential negative impacts on trust-based social networks foundational to resource management and transboundary governance. To inform development of a post-pandemic new-normal in resource management, we examined trust relationships using the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America as a case study. 82.9% (n = 97/117) of Great Lakes fishery managers and scientists surveyed indicated that virtual engagement was effective for maintaining well-established relationships during the pandemic; however, 76.7% (n = 89/116) of respondents indicated in-person engagement to be more effective than virtual engagement for building and maintaining trust. Despite some shortcomings, virtual or remote engagement presents opportunities, such as: (1) care and nurturing of well-established long-term relationships; (2) short-term (1-3 years) trust maintenance; (3) peer-peer or mentor-mentee coordination; (4) supplemental communications; (5) producer-push knowledge dissemination; and, if done thoughtfully, (6) enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations implemented vaccine mandates for HCWs. Whether or not a traditional quality improvement approach can achieve high-rates of COVID-19 vaccination is not known. Our organization undertook iterative changes that focused on the barriers to vaccine uptake. These barriers were identified through huddles, and addressed through extensive peer outreach, with a focus on access and issues related to equity, diversity and inclusion. The outreach interventions were informed by real-time data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in our organization. The vaccine rate reached 92.3% by 6 December 2021 with minimal differences in vaccine uptake by professional role, clinical department, facility or whether the staff had a patient facing role. Improving vaccine uptake should be a quality improvement target in healthcare organizations and our experience shows that high vaccine rates are achievable through concerted efforts targeting specific barriers to vaccine confidence.",Weinerman AS

Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2023,3,Words matter: The language of difference in human genetics.,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in academia are leading publishers and journals to re-examine their use of terminology for commonly used scientific variables. This reassessment of language is particularly important for human genetics, which is focused on identifying and explaining differences between individuals and populations. Recent guidance on the use of terms and symbols in clinical practice, research, and publications is beginning to acknowledge the ways that language and concepts of difference can be not only inaccurate but also harmful. To stop perpetuating historical wrongs, those of us who conduct and publish genetic research and provide genetic health care must understand the context of the terms we use and why some usages should be discontinued. In this article, we summarize critiques of terminology describing disability, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and ancestry in research publications, laboratory reports, diagnostic codes, and pedigrees. We also highlight recommendations for alternative language that aims to make genetics more inclusive, rigorous, and ethically sound. Even though norms of acceptable language use are ever changing, it is the responsibility of genetics professionals to uncover biases ingrained in professional practice and training and to continually reassess the words we use to describe human difference because they cause harm to patients.",Cho MK
Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,3,A Review of the Evolving Landscape of Inclusive Research and Improved Clinical Trial Access.,"Current clinical research does not reflect the diversity of patient populations, despite continued recommendations to increase enrollment of under-represented racial and ethnic groups. The ramifications of this lack of trial diversity are important because of potential differences between races and ethnicities in response to therapies, which have been observed for drugs across indications. Nonrepresentative research populations limit the generalizability of study results, which may lead to questions about safety and efficacy in certain subgroups of patients and hinder regulators, healthcare providers, and patients in their ability to adequately consider the benefits and risks of a therapeutic treatment across all populations. Renewed efforts to address healthcare disparities and increase diversity in clinical trials have demonstrated that inclusive trials are achievable and can provide scientifically rigorous results, and, thus, should stimulate greater action across all stakeholders. Ensuring that studies throughout the clinical development process include representative populations is a scientific imperative to advance health equity, racial justice, and trust in the safety and efficacy of medical therapies. This article reviews the long-standing lack of diversity and barriers to enrollment of diverse and representative populations in clinical trials, outlines the current evolving trial landscape and the efforts of stakeholders, and provides examples from scientifically rigorous inclusive trials. The goal is to share learnings in a wider context of opportunities to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical development while ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical therapies in all populations of patients, and in doing so, provide wider patient access to therapeutic treatments.",Mohan SV
Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,3,Enhancing Diversity and Inclusion in Clinical Trials.,"Women and people from most racial and ethnic groups in the United States have historically been under-represented in clinical trials of investigational medical products. Inadequate representation of these groups may lead to an incomplete understanding of the safety and efficacy of new drugs, devices, biologics, and vaccines, and limit the generalizability of trial findings. As a result, new medical products may not be beneficial to all people who need them, and existing inequities in outcomes among various population groups may remain unchanged or worsen, or new disparities may arise. Although much work has focused on study-level strategies, research organizations must make systemic changes to how clinical trials are envisioned and implemented to achieve sustainable support for diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) conducted interviews with leaders at institutions that conduct clinical trials to explore perspectives on organizational-level practices that promote diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. Leaders described motivations, such as an ethical and moral imperative; organizational practices, such as staff investment and resource allocation; perceived return on investments, such as better science; and deterrents, such as cost and time. The CTTI also convened an expert meeting to discuss the interview findings and provide guidance. We present the interview findings and expert guidance in a framework that describes four key areas-commitment, partnerships, accountability, and resources-on sustaining organizational-level approaches for improving diversity and inclusion in clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of advancing health equity. Institutions who conduct and support clinical trials should implement organizational-level approaches to improve equitable access and diverse patient participation in clinical trials.",Corneli A

Communities of color and low-income populations live, work, and play in environments with disproportionate exposure to hazards associated with allergic disease. This unequal distribution of hazards has contributed to health disparities and is largely the result of systemic racism that promotes segregation of neighborhoods, disinvestment in predominantly racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods, and discriminatory housing, employment, and lending practices. The AAAAI Environmental Exposure and Respiratory Health Committee and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee jointly developed this report to improve allergy/immunology specialists' awareness of environmental injustice, its roots in systemic racism, and its impact on health disparities in allergic disease. We present evidence supporting the relationship between exposure to environmental hazards, particularly at the neighborhood level, and the disproportionately high incidence and poor outcomes from allergic diseases in marginalized populations. Achieving environmental justice requires investment in at-risk communities to increase access to safe housing, clean air and water, employment opportunities, education, nutrition, and health care.

Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,3,Clinical Trial Site Perspectives and Practices on Study Participant Diversity and Inclusion.,"Clinical trial participant populations fail to adequately represent target populations that drugs are intended to serve. Improving racial and ethnic diversity of clinical trial participants is essential for generalizable, quality clinical research results and ensuring social and medical equity. Site-level clinical research professionals (CRPs) have unique insights on diversity improvement strategies for clinical trial enrollment. A survey was distributed to current CRPs working at clinical research sites in the United States to describe current practices and perceptions of the impact these practices have on participant diversity. Subsequently, descriptive quantitative analysis and inductive content analysis were performed. For the practices surveyed, there are discrepancies between frequency of use and perceived impact on diversity enrollment. Common current practices include phone-based or telemedicine study visits, electronic/digital data collection, and participant compensation. However, we report travel reimbursement and services, translated documents and translator services, and adequate participant compensation as most impactful on diverse enrollment. A multistakeholder approach is necessary to enhance diversity and inclusion (D&I) of study participants. Besides large-scale solutions such as countering community distrust, actionable steps are needed by sponsors and study sites to improve D&I of trial participants. Study leadership at the sponsor, contract research organization (CRO), and site-level should create diversity plans prior to study start, and CRO and sponsor budgets should consider D&I strategies during study planning. Planning should incorporate strategies to improve D&I including adequate participant compensation, translated documents and translator services, and travel reimbursements.",MacLennan DL

Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,3,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Clinical Research: A Path Toward Precision Health for Everyone.","Healthcare disparities are a persistent societal problem. One of the contributing factors to this status quo is the lack of diversity and representativeness of research efforts, which result in nongeneralizable evidence that, in turn, provides suboptimal means to enable the best possible outcomes at the individual level. There are several strategies that research teams can adopt to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) of their efforts; these strategies span the totality of the research path, from initial design to the shepherding of clinical data through a potential regulatory process. These strategies include more intentionality and DEI-based goal-setting, more diverse research and leadership teams, better community engagement to set study goals and approaches, better tailored outreach interventions, decentralization of study procedures and incorporation of innovative technology for more flexible data collection, and self-surveillance to identify and prevent biases. Within their remit of overlooking research efforts, regulatory authorities, as stakeholders, also have the potential for a positive effect on the DEI of emerging clinical evidence. All these are implementable tools and mechanisms that can make study participation more approachable to diverse communities, and ultimately generate evidence that is more generalizable and a conduit for better outcomes. The research community has an imperative to make DEI principles key foundational aspects in study conduct in order to pursue better personalized medicine for diverse patient populations.",Washington V
American journal of pharmaceutical education,2023,3,"Taking Action Towards Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the Pharmacy Curriculum and Continuing Professional Development.","Increased awareness of social injustices and inequities highlight the relevance and importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in health care. Former and recent graduates of pharmacy schools remain deficient in their knowledge of DEIA topics such as unconscious bias, which can directly influence health outcomes in an undesirable manner. Particular DEIA areas that are pertinent to pharmacy practice include: race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability status, religion, socioeconomic status, and political beliefs. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) affirmed its commitment to DEIA as a priority. However, existing gaps in knowledge of pharmacy graduates in this area have the potential to contribute to health disparities and inequities, which are significant public health issues. We call on academic pharmacy institutions and professional pharmacy organizations to elevate DEIA topics and to designate them as essential to both addressing health equity and improving care for underserved populations. We also implore licensing boards to require continuing education related to DEIA as a foundational step to closing the knowledge gap for pharmacists in this area.",Arif SA

Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,2022,5,Freedom from discrimination or freedom to discriminate? Discursive tensions within discrimination policies in medical education.,"The importance of advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion for all members of the academic medical community has gained recent attention. Academic medical organizations have attempted to increase broader representation while seeking structural reforms consistent with the goal of enhancing equity and reducing disproportionality. However, efforts remain constrained while minority groups continue to experience discrimination. In this study, the authors sought to identify and understand the discursive effects of discrimination policies within medical education. The authors assembled an archive of 22 texts consisting of publicly available discrimination and harassment policy documents in 13 Canadian medical schools that were active as of November 2019. Each text was analysed to identify themes, rhetorical strategies, problematization, and power relations. Policies described truth statements that appear to idealize equity, yet there were discourses related to professionalism and neutrality that were in tension with these ideals. There was also tension between organizations' framing of a shared responsibility for addressing discrimination and individual responsibility on complainants. Lastly, there were also competing discourses on promoting freedom from discrimination and the concept of academic freedom. Overall, findings reveal several areas of tension that shape how discrimination is addressed in policy versus practice. Existing discourses regarding self-protection and academic freedom suggest equity cannot be advanced through policy discourse alone and more substantive structural transformation may be necessary. Existing approaches may be inadequate to address discrimination unless academic medical organizations interrogate the source of these discursive tensions and consider asymmetries of power.",Sukhera J

The International journal of eating disorders,2022,4,Accountability in promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders field: A call to action.,"Promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders (EDs) field among professionals and the populations studied and served has long been discussed, with limited progress. This may be due to a reinforcing feedback loop in which individuals from dominant cultures conduct research and deliver treatment, participate in research, and receive diagnoses and treatment. This insularity maintains underrepresentation: EDs in historically marginalized populations are understudied, undetected, and undertreated. An Early Career Investigators Workshop generated recommendations for change that were not inherently novel but made apparent that accountability is missing. This paper serves as a call to action to spearhead a paradigm shift from equality to equity in the ED field. We provide a theoretical framework, suggest ways to disrupt the feedback loop, and summarize actionable steps to increase accountability in ED leadership and research toward enhancing racial/ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). These actionable steps are outlined in the service of challenging our field to reflect the diversity of our global community. We must develop and implement measurable metrics to assess our progress toward increasing diversity of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and to address JEDI issues in our providers, patients, and research participants.",Goel NJ

Annals of family medicine,2022,3,The EMBOLDEN Co-design study: Partnering with older adults and communities to develop a community program to enhance mobility.,"Context: Physical mobility and social participation are requisite for independence and quality of life as one ages. Barriers to mobility lead to social isolation, poor physical and mental health, all of which are precursors to frailty. To date, most mobility-enhancing interventions in older adults have been designed by researchers without citizen input and delivered in controlled settings; their translation to real-world contexts is often impractical and rarely occurs. Objectives: i) To engage older adults and community service providers to qualitatively explore priorities, needs, enablers and barriers to mobility and community participation faced by older adults, and ii) To co-design an evidence-informed, feasible, acceptable group intervention to support mobility and promote health among older adults facing health inequities. Study Design: Adapted experience-based co-design, conducted in collaboration with a Strategic Guiding Council comprised of older adults and service providers. Setting: Community-based. Population studied: Community-dwelling older adults (55+) and local health and social service providers. Outcome Measures: EMBOLDEN's Strategic Guiding Council and the research team collectively interpreted qualitative study findings, together with results of completed systematic reviews and an environmental scan, to determine priority design features of a community-based mobility-enhancing intervention to enable health and well-being in older adults in Hamilton, ON. Results: Eighteen diverse older adults and 16 service providers completed persona scenario interviews. These lived experience perspectives were analyzed, interpreted, and integrated with research and local evidence in the intervention co-design process. Priority design features for the intervention included duration, intensity, mode of delivery, characteristics of interventionists, and implementation strategies. Findings highlighted key strategies related to participant motivation, recruitment, and engagement, as well as important equity, diversity, and inclusion considerations. Conclusions: Partnering with diverse stakeholders is critical to identifying optimal design features of a community-based intervention to promote mobility. Ultimately, we aim to implement and evaluate a health promoting intervention that is sustainable, scalable, addresses health inequities, and effectively improves the lives of older adults.",
Annals of family medicine,2022,3,Moving Beyond Inquiry: Clinician Training Opportunities to Promote Racial Justice in Clinical Care.,"Context: The Presence 5 for Racial Justice (P5RJ), an adaptation of the Stanford Presence 5 framework practices, comprises anti-racism clinician communication practices that promote health equity and build trusting relationships with Black patients. Objective: We sought to identify specific statements and actions that clinicians use to promote racial justice in their clinical care. Study Design: Mixed-methods analysis of a survey, using deductive and inductive approaches to identify themes in qualitative data. Dataset: N=53 specific phrases provided in response to open-ended survey prompts related to the P5RJ practices. Population studied: N=50 respondents (27 clinicians, 17 medical trainees, and 6 unreported) recruited through convenience sampling and listservs of clinicians with expertise in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Respondents identified as Asian (9), Black/African American (10), Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish Origin (4), White/Caucasian (20), Write-in (1), and more than one race/ethnicity (6). Outcome Measures: Clinician statements were mapped to P5RJ domains and were categorized using Goffman's communication theory as 1) inquiry (e.g. ""What effect (if any) do you feel race has had on your health or your interactions with the health care system?""), 2) self-accountability (e.g. ""I am sorry I made that assumption""), 3) empathetic statements (e.g. ""You seem sad, but maybe I am misinterpreting that. How are you feeling?""), and/or 4) statements of allyship (e.g. ""Would you let me know if you feel you can't speak up and I will speak up for you?""). Results: Across all five practices, ""Inquiry"" was the predominant theme identified (58.5%), followed by ""Empathy"" (24.5%), ""Statements of Allyship"" (9.4%), and ""Self-Accountability"" (7.5%). 94% of respondents indicated diversity, equity, and inclusion involvement, and all respondents who provided specific phrases were in this category. Conclusions: Clinicians and medical trainees alike use inquiry as a predominant communication practice when addressing racism and promoting health equity. This may be due to a higher comfort level given the central role of question-asking during history-taking in medical training and clinical care. Our findings suggest an opportunity to focus anti-racism communication training on statements of empathy, self-accountability, and allyship. Future research is needed to evaluate patient preferences on appropriate types of clinician statements to promote health equity in clinical care.",

Developmental science,2023,2,"Stereotypes in the classroom's air: Classroom racial stereotype endorsement, classroom engagement, and STEM achievement among Black and White American adolescents.","Initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in predominantly White contexts, including STEM fields, have primarily relied on approaches to increase the representation of minoritized individuals. However, an increase in the representation of minoritized individuals is only one step of the process, as the present study suggests that explicit beliefs about particular racial groups' abilities also matter. The present article examined whether classroom racial stereotype endorsement about science and math disadvantaged Black American adolescents relative to their White American peers. Across two longitudinal studies with 533 and 1,189 adolescents (N-adolescents = 1722; N-classrooms = 86; 45% Black American, 55% White American; 51% females; M-age = 13-14), classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement in the fall term predicted better science and math achievement scores for White American adolescents and lower science and math achievement scores for Black American adolescents at the end of the academic year. Student- and teacher-reported student engagement in science and math classrooms mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement and students' achievement scores. Results suggest that classrooms may be important conduits for communicating racial stereotypes that create racially hostile STEM learning environments. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Using a longitudinal sample of 1722 adolescents enrolled in 86 classrooms, the present study examined the consequences of classroom racial stereotype endorsement during adolescence. White American adolescents demonstrated favorable achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed traditional, or pro-White/anti-Black, stereotypes. Black American adolescents showed worse achievement scores in science and math when their classmates endorsed pro-White/anti-Black stereotypes. Classroom engagement mediated the longitudinal relations between classroom pro-White/anti-Black stereotype endorsement and achievement scores for both Black and White American adolescents.",Del Toro J

Because bibliometrics is a powerful tool to reveal the scientific literature on a specific topic during a certain timespan, a systematic bibliometric analysis of the documents published on EDI in radiation oncology was performed, aiming at exploring common patterns in research and emerging trends, tracking collaborations and networks, and anticipating future directions in clinical research. Standard descriptive statistics and bibliometric techniques were used in the analysis. A collaboration network and thematic map were generated from the data. Four domains were represented: (1) motor themes, including themes well developed and important for the structuring of the research field; (2) niche themes, representing the isolated topics that do not share important external links with other themes; (3) emerging themes, referring to still weakly developed topics; and (4) basic themes, including the essential topics.

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2023,2,Beyond Compliance: Growth as the Guiding Value in Undergraduate Medical Education.,"Adhering to the paradigm of the natural sciences, much of undergraduate medical education (UME) in the United States remains committed to objectivity, compliance, and standardization in its approach to teaching, evaluation, student affairs, and accreditation practices. The authors argue that, while these simple and complicated problem solving (SCPS) approaches may be valid for some highly controlled environments of UME, they lack rigor in complex, real-world environments where optimal care and education is not standardized but is tailored to context and individual needs. This argument is supported by evidence that ""systems"" approaches, characterized by complex problem solving (CPS, differentiated from complicated problem solving), lead to better outcomes in patient care and student academic performance. Examples of interventions implemented at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine from 2011 to 2021 further illustrate this point. Interventions in student well-being that emphasize personal and professional growth have led to student satisfaction that is 20% higher than the national average on the Association of American Medical Colleges' Graduation Questionnaire (GQ). Career advising interventions that augment the use of adaptive behaviors in place of rules and guidelines have yielded 30% fewer residency applications per student than the national average while simultaneously yielding residency ""unmatched"" rates that are one-third of the national average. Regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion, an emphasis on civil discourse around real-world problems has been associated with student attitudes toward diversity that are 40% more favorable than the national average on the GQ. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of matriculating students who are underrepresented in medicine to 35% of the incoming class. The article concludes with a review of philosophic barriers to incorporating the CPS paradigm into UME and of notable pedagogic differences between CPS and SCPS approaches.",Woodruff JN

Of the demographic groups, female patients and black patients are underenrolled relative to disease distribution in clinical trials and are under-referred for RPM, including remote haemodynamic monitoring, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), wearables and telehealth interventions. The sex- and race-based disparities are multifactorial: stringent clinical trial inclusion criteria, distrust of the medical establishment, poor access to healthcare, socioeconomic inequities, and lack of diversity in clinical trial leadership. Notwithstanding addressing the above factors, RPM has the unique potential to reduce disparities through a combination of implicit bias mitigation and earlier detection and intervention for HF disease progression in disadvantaged groups. This review describes the uptake of remote haemodynamic monitoring, CIEDs and telehealth in female patients and black patients with HF, and discusses aetiologies that may contribute to inequities and strategies to promote health equity.",Mastoris I

A two-step process was followed to generate and refine concepts, guided by Delphi methodology. First, a scoping review was conducted, including original peer-reviewed research articles that quantified or qualitatively described determinant(s) of racial or ethnic differences in athlete mental health or mental healthcare. Next, a multiday virtual meeting was facilitated to review the results of the scoping review, discuss lived experiences and generate potential concepts. Participants included a racially and ethnically diverse group of student-athletes, medical and mental health professionals, athletics administrators, diversity, equity and inclusion experts, health educators and representatives from leading organisations involved in athlete mental health. Through the consensus process, participants identified 42 concepts that member institutions might consider implementing on their campuses. Concepts were largely focused on organisational policies and practices such as staffing diversity and inclusion, expanded options for clinical support (ie, identity-relevant support groups) and within-organisation accountability. Concepts related to specific areas for stakeholder education were also identified. Institutions have the potential to play an important role in supporting the mental well being of student-athletes of colour, and the present concepts can help inform institutional action. While concepts proposed are believed to be broadly relevant across athletics settings, they would need to be further considered and tailored to reflect setting-specific organisational structures, resources and needs.",Kroshus E

Psychological reports,2023,2,Development and Validation of the Revised Multicultural Ideology Scale in Germany and Luxembourg.,"A revised version of the Multicultural Ideology Scale (rMCI) is currently being developed to measure endorsement of multiculturalism in different cultural contexts. This study, which is part of a wider cross-cultural research project, presents the first assessment of the rMCI scale in the German language. The measure aims to cover several attitudinal dimensions of multiculturalism, relevant to the integration of different ethnocultural groups: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. Two independent datasets were acquired from Germany ( N  = 382) and Luxembourg ( N  = 148) to estimate the factor structure of the rMCI using different confirmatory factor analysis techniques. The findings suggest that a four-factor solution, including Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity, was the best fit for the data. Most of these subscales demonstrated adequate psychometric properties (internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity). The four-factor model of the rMCI was partially invariant across the two ethnic groups and full measurement invariance was established across gender.",Stogianni M
Journal of the National Medical Association,2023,2,Words matter: Tracing the implicit meaning of diversity language (and its absence) in medical school mission statements.,"Despite recent attention to social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion within medical education, little is currently known about whether and to what extent that attention has translated into the language of formal documents articulating organization purpose: medical school mission statements. Mission statements are the marquee declaration of a medical school's identity and purpose, and a recommended tool for applicants to determine ""fit"" when applying. This study examines whether and to what extent social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion have made it into the formal public statements of organizational purpose and identity over the last several years. Mission statements were extracted manually from the 2007, 2017, and 2021 AAMCs Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) database for both U.S. and Canadian M.D. granting medical schools. Then each mission statement version was coded for the presence and degree of diversity language including words like social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion using an agreed-upon lexicon. Frequencies and within school changes over time were analyzed. Among 139 medical schools with discoverable mission statements from 2007, 91% (n=127) changed their MSs between 2007 and 2021. In 2007, 24% (n=33) of MSs contained diversity language. By 2017 nearly half of MSs; 47% (n=65) contained any reference to such language. But by 2021, despite 46 school having changed their MSs again, only a few more included diversity language in their MSs (56%; n=77). The most common terms used were ""diversity,"" followed by the increasing presence of words like ""inclusion,"" ""equity,"" and ""justice"" by 2021. Curiously, a few schools redacted diversity language from 2007 to 2021. A Diversity Thesaurus of 22 terms was iteratively identified, with all terms searched in all MSs. Overall, mission statement change was quite common with most medical schools making changes across the 14 years covered in this study. And despite a doubling of the number of medical schools MSs mentioning diversity over a 10-year period, that increase seemed to slow in recent years even among schools who had a chance to change their MS. As of mid-2021, two in five US medical schools still have no mention of diversity related language in their most formal, said articulation of organizational purpose.",Dens Higano J
American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2023,2,Educational guidelines for diversity and inclusion: addressing racism and eliminating biases in medical education.,"Racism and bias contribute to healthcare disparities at a patient and population health level and also contribute to the stagnation or even regression of progress toward equitable representation in the workforce and in healthcare leadership. Medical education and healthcare systems have expended tremendous efforts over the past several years to address these inequities. However, systemic racism continues to impact health outcomes and the future physician workforce. The Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics called for action to achieve a future free from racism in obstetrics and gynecology education and healthcare. As a result of this call to action, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Guidelines Task Force was created. The mission of the Task Force was to support educators in their efforts to identify and create educational materials that augment antiracist educational goals and prepare, recruit, and retain a talented and diverse workforce. In this Special Report, the authors share these guidelines that describe best practices and set new standards to increase diversity, foster inclusivity, address systemic racism, and eliminate bias in obstetrics and gynecology educational products, materials, and environments.",Buery-Joyner SD
Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,2023,2,Workforce Diversity of Interventional Radiology Physicians in North America: Reflections on the U.S. Experience.,"Achieving parity in representation within the field of Interventional Radiology (IR) across women and specific subsets of minority groups has been a challenge. The lack of a strongly diverse physician workforce in gender, race, and ethnicity suggests suboptimal recruitment after, during as well prior to IR training. There is a dearth of studies which effectively characterize the national demographic trends of the evolving IR workforce. This has prevented an accurate appraisal of continuing efforts to narrow the gaps in physician workforce diversity across the field of IR. To support these needs, this article illustrates historic trends while providing contemporary data that canvasses the status of diversity within the current IR physician and IR trainee workforce. It highlights the representation of those individuals historically underrepresented in medicine as well as women. It also highlights current obstacles to achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion within the field of IR as well as existing efforts that have been employed to mitigate this gap.",Higgins MCSS
Women & health,2023,2,Gender disparity among ophthalmologists awarded Canadian institute of health research grants.,"Despite efforts toward equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic ophthalmology faculties, gender disparity continues to exist. Current evidence indicates that female ophthalmologists consistently hold lower academic ranks and receive less funding from the National Institutes of Health compared to their male colleagues. The extent of this disparity is unknown in the Canadian context. We sought to characterize the gender gap in Canadian Institutes of Health Research funding among ophthalmologists. From inception, funding decision data were collected from the official Canadian Institutes of Health Research website database hosted by the Government of Canada. Measures including gender, number of grants held over the study period, number of simultaneous grants, and total funding were collected. Female ophthalmologists were consistently awarded fewer grants (21.43 percent) compared to male counterparts and were less likely to hold multiple grants since 2008. An over five-fold disparity was found in total funding for female compared to male ophthalmologists. As well, females were less likely than males to hold a grant in each particular year except in 2020. Female ophthalmologists continue to face barriers to attaining academic support from Canadian Institute of Health Research funds. Continued action to mitigate this gender gap may improve gender-based parity in federal research funding.",Tien CW

International journal for equity in health,2023,1,"Five ways 'health scholars' are complicit in upholding health inequities, and how to stop.","Health scholars have been enthusiastic in critique of health inequities, but comparatively silent on the ways in which our own institutions, and our actions within them, recreate and retrench systems of oppression. The behaviour of health scholars within academic institutions have far reaching influences on the health-related workforce, the nature of evidence, and the policy solutions within our collective imaginations. Progress on health equity requires moving beyond platitudes like 'equity, diversity and inclusion' statements and trainings towards actually being and doing differently within our day-to-day practices. Applying complex systems change theory to identify, examine and shift mental models, or habits of thought (and action), that are keeping us stuck in our efforts to advance health equity is a promising approach. This paper introduces five common mental models that are preventing meaningful equity-oriented systems transformation within academia and offers ideas for shifting them towards progressively more productive, and authentic, actions by health scholars to advance health equity across systems.",Shahram SZ

In this commentary, I attempt to support and expand an argument made by Ellis and Kendall (2021), namely, that systemic racism has been and continues to be a normal and persistent feature of our academic programs. A comparison to U.S. Census data suggests that Asian, Black, Indigenous, Native, Latino/a/e, and multiracial CSD professionals are represented to a drastically lower rate compared with their representation in the population at large.

Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023,1,Let's Not Repeat History's Mistakes: Two Cautions to Scientists on the Use of Race in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Research.,"Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) research has advanced gene and biomarker technologies to aid identification of individuals at risk for dementia. This innovation is a lynchpin in development of disease-modifying therapies. The emerging science could transform outcomes for patients and families. However, current limitations in the racial representation and inclusion of racial diversity in research limits the relevance of these technologies: AD/ADRD research cohorts used to define biomarker cutoffs are mostly White, despite clinical and epidemiologic research that shows Black populations are among those experiencing the greatest burdens of AD/ADRD. White cohorts alone are insufficient to characterize heterogeneity in disease and in life experiences that can alter AD/ADRD's courses. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has called for increased racial diversity in AD/ADRD research. While scientists are working to implement NIA's plan to build more diverse research cohorts, they are also seeking out opportunities to consider race in AD/ADRD research. Recently, scientists have posed two ways of including race in AD/ADRD research: ancestry-based verification of race and race-based adjustment of biomarker test results. Both warrant careful examination for how they are impacting AD/ADRD science with respect to specific study objectives and the broader mission of the field. If these research methods are not grounded in pursuit of equity and justice, biases they introduce into AD/ADRD science could perpetuate, or even worsen, disparities in AD/ADRD research and care.",Stites SD

This study accounts for structural inequities and assesses the relationship between early-life and later-life SES, and risk of osteoporosis diagnosis. Data come from the nationally representative, population-based cohort Health and Retirement Study and include individuals ages 50 to 90. The outcome variable is osteoporosis diagnosis. Logistic regression models of the relationship between SES and osteoporosis diagnosis are estimated, accounting for demographic, health, and childhood variables. Higher levels of childhood and adult SES link to lower odds of osteoporosis diagnosis. Structural inequities in income and underdiagnosis of osteoporosis among persons identifying as Black/African American were detected. Accounting for bone density scan access, inequities in osteoporosis diagnosis appear to stem from barriers to accessing health care due to financial constraints. The important role of SES and evidence of structural inequities leading to underdiagnosis suggest the critical importance of clinicians receiving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training to reduce health inequities.",Gough Courtney M

Journal of forensic sciences,2023,1,Forensic archeology as a high-impact practice.,"High-impact practices (HIPs) are educational modalities that focus on experiential and deep learning to affect student success in higher education, particularly among students matriculating from historically underserved communities. HIPs are designed to provide students with the intellectual and practical skills to succeed in an increasingly unstable global world beyond college. Utilizing a private-public partnership forensic archeological contract project, this paper examines how this venture employed a HIP-based contractor model that hired students as a professional archeological field crew and provided them with a living wage, transportation, and room and board. It also provided students without the means to participate in international fieldwork with the wherewithal to do so, supporting underserved students and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. Utilizing this HIP-based contract model resulted in greater student investment and collaboration in a fieldwork situation more akin to the real world, where students learned to solve problems, communicate, and network in an international setting, resulting in new opportunities, such as professional jobs, and academic projects and publications. The paid contractor model ensured students with limited resources could participate, broadening the type of student who can receive this type of training, expanding diversity in forensic anthropology. These models are not limited to forensic archeological fieldwork; they can also be applied to forensic anthropology laboratory projects. Utilizing HIPs and employing a more equitable contractor model contributes to student professionalization, strengthens professional prospects beyond the university, and contributes to DEIB initiatives, all of which benefit forensic anthropology as a subdiscipline.",Kolpan KE

Journal of business and psychology,2023,1,Black Physicians' Experiences with Anti-Black Racism in Healthcare Systems Explored Through An Attraction-Selection-Attrition Lens.,"Anti-Black racism is a specific form of racism directed at Black people. In healthcare, there are poignant examples of anti-Black racism in the recruitment, selection, and retention stages of the job cycle. Research shows that anti-Black racism is associated with inequitable work outcomes and the under-representation of Black physicians. However, empirical findings are scattered with no organizing framework to consolidate these findings. To add to the literature, in this paper we present the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model (Schneider, 1987) as an organizing framework to discuss Black physicians' experiences with anti-Black racism and discrimination throughout their careers. We draw from previous literature to highlight specific experiences of Black physicians at each stage of the job cycle (i.e., attraction, selection, retention), and we offer considerations on how practitioners can mitigate anti-Black racism throughout the job cycle. In the wake of COVID-19 and highly publicized social justice movements, healthcare systems are seeking ways to increase the recruitment, selection, and retention of Black physicians to ensure health equity. We believe this guide will be valuable to practitioners, leaders, researchers, and program directions seeking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion of Black physicians in their healthcare systems. We conclude by providing practical implications and directions for future research.",Williams MS
Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2023,1,PARALLELS BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND HUMAN DIVERSITY: A MANDATE TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH AND VITALITY.,"The veterinary medical profession-including in marine biology and oceanography, ecology, conservation science, and zoo, wildlife, aquatic, and exotic animal medicine-suffers from a well-known lack of diversity. It is the author's view that in order to ensure that animals (and plants) have the environment they need to thrive, and to address urgent ecosystem health and conservation issues in our global interconnected communities, our wildlife, zoo, and conservation science organizations must embrace diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB). Just as biodiversity is critical for the health and vitality of our ecosystem, the diversity of the people who care for those ecosystems will protect the health and vibrancy of our professions and organizations. Though research may not yet have established a direct link between the diversification of such organizations and the advancement of biodiversity, that does not mean there is no such effect or impact. With myriad evidence that diverse organizations are better at solving complex problems, why would there be an expectation that these professions would fare differently? A call to action is for such organizations to conduct and publish research regarding the impact of increased human diversity on their missions of enhancing biodiversity. The challenges to biodiversity are great, and our organizations must use every tool in the toolkit to find solutions-including enhancing DEIB. This article elaborates on the many benefits that come with prioritizing DEIB in our organizations-similar to those benefits arising from healthy, biodiverse ecosystems. Potential action steps are shared that organizations and associations may consider in promoting DEIB and igniting progress.",Moore RM

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2023,1,Inclusivity in Leader Selection: An 8-Step Process to Promote Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Leadership.,"At a systemic level, organizations need to take intentional steps to build inclusion, equity, and diversity at all levels. In accordance with this need, organizations have been catalyzed by national conversations surrounding gender and racial/ethnic discrimination to generate sustainable change that addresses the disenfranchisement of women and racial/ethnic minorities. Although progress toward addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate these inequities has been made in recent years, research indicates that underrepresentation at the leadership level persists in academic medicine. Further, those in more senior roles are more likely to select, sponsor, and/or mentor individuals like themselves, thereby depriving minority populations of experiences directly correlated with career development and advancement. Hence, the authors posit a focus on the characteristics and competencies of a leader along with a structured selection process is an effective intervention to reduce bias and support inclusion by recalibrating the representation of leadership within academic medical centers. To this end, the authors developed a sequential 8-step leader selection process informed by their model of leadership characteristics and competencies. This process includes a policy update, selection of interview panels, training of panelists, screening the candidate pool, structured interview guides, final candidate slates, assessments of final candidates, and development of newly selected leaders. By following this process, the authors' organization has seen an increase in the representation of women and racial/ethnic minority leaders, an increase in employees' favorable perceptions specific to representation, and data indicative of developing and maintaining an internal diverse leadership candidate pipeline. Ultimately, inclusion makes stronger and more resilient organizations. By following a standardized process grounded in leadership characteristics and competencies, academic medical centers can see changes in their leadership that mirror the populations they lead and serve. Using such processes can lead to the kind of systemic change needed to create inclusive environments.",Holladay CL

JEDI curriculum can foster diversity and inclusion by acknowledging and addressing social justice issues, providing a safe and inclusive space for students' voices to be heard, and advancing a productive dialogue within their institution of higher learning. Furthermore, such curriculum initiatives can empower students with the theoretical frameworks, analytical tools, and knowledge base to recognize and address ethical challenges and opportunities related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in their field. This Teaching Tips paper offers a description of a pilot program to incorporate JEDI material within a core bioengineering course modeled on evidence-based curriculum programs to embed ethics within technical courses. The author and collaborators sought to achieve two aims with the JEDI-focused material: (1) for students to learn how justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion intersect with bioengineering practice through an interdisciplinary lens of history, philosophy, sociology and anthropology which provide strong scholarly frameworks and theoretical foundations and (2) for students to participate in and foster an inclusive environment within their own educational institution through effectively communicating about these topics with each other. At the conclusion of the semester, a student survey indicated an overwhelmingly positive reception of the material. This paper will discuss the interdisciplinary curriculum development initiative, how the learning objectives were addressed by the specific lesson plans, and challenges to be addressed to create a sustainable educational model for the program.",Shields B
American journal of otolaryngology,2023,1,"Leveraging the virtual landscape to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.","The pandemic era has wrought disruptive changes across all aspects of academic medicine, transforming clinical care systems, research enterprises, and educational practices. Among these sweeping changes, some of the most significant for Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (OHNS) relate to innovative use of virtual communication. The virtual landscape has not only redefined the delivery of patient care but also expanded educational interactions across the career continuum. As the architecture of relationships has been reimagined, the traditional Halstedian teaching paradigm has evolved, now integrating in-person, virtual, and hybrid learning. Once formidable barriers to distance learning have diminished, giving way to social networks that support mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship. Creative use of technology supports collaboration, feedback, spaced learning, scaffolding, and interleaving. These advances have immediate significance for OHNS, a highly collaborative specialty that leads in technological innovation and aspires to improve diversity. Whereas traditional efforts to grow the ranks of underrepresented in medicine (URiM) individuals in OHNS yielded only incremental progress, the virtual landscape is unveiling new strategies for reengineering narrow or leaky pipelines. Strategies that can help attract URiM applicants include inclusive departmental web presence, interactive online clinical experiences, virtual interviews, and remote research opportunities. As students, surgeons, and scientists collectively embrace technology, accelerated progress toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) becomes possible. Maximizing these opportunities requires aligning national and institutional imperatives for diversity with departmental priorities and mission. Finally, intentional outreach and holistic assessment support growth of structured virtual communities that foster equitable access for those who need it most.",Ortega CA
Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing,2023,1,Session Introduction: Digital health technology data in biocomputing: Research efforts and considerations for expanding access.,"Data from digital health technologies (DHT), including wearable sensors like Apple Watch, Whoop, Oura Ring, and Fitbit, are increasingly being used in biomedical research. Research and development of DHT-related devices, platforms, and applications is happening rapidly and with significant private-sector involvement with new biotech companies and large tech companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Uber) investing heavily in technologies to improve human health. Many academic institutions are building capabilities related to DHT research, often in cross-sector collaboration with technology companies and other organizations with the goal of generating clinically meaningful evidence to improve patient care, to identify users at an earlier stage of disease presentation, and to support health preservation and disease prevention. Large research consortia, cross-sector partnerships, and individual research labs are all represented in the current corpus of published studies. Some of the large research studies, like NIH's All of Us Research Program, make data sets from wearable sensors available to the research community, while the vast majority of data from wearable sensors and other DHTs are held by private sector organizations and are not readily available to the research community. As data are unlocked from the private sector and made available to the academic research community, there is an opportunity to develop innovative analytics and methods through expanded access. This Session solicited research results leveraging digital health technologies, including wearable sensor data, describing novel analytical methods, and issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) of both the underlying research data sets and the community of researchers working in this area.

Journal of business ethics : JBE,2023,1,The EThIC Model of Virtue-Based Allyship Development: A New Approach to Equity and Inclusion in Organizations.,"As organizations take on grand challenges in gender equality, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ protections and workplace inclusion, many well-intentioned individuals from dominant groups (e.g., cisgender men, Caucasian, heterosexual) are stepping forward as allies toward underrepresented or marginalized group members (e.g., cisgender women, People of Color, LGBTQ+ identified employees). Past research and guidance assume an inevitable need for external motivation, reflected in the 'business case' for diversity and in top-down policies to drive equity and inclusion efforts. This qualitative study explored internal motivations in the form of morally motivated virtues of 25 peer-nominated exemplary allies serving in leadership positions. In-depth life/career story interviews were used to identify the virtues that supported their allyship journeys. Findings demonstrated that they tapped into several virtues that served distinct functions in a 4-stage allyship development process: Stage 1-Energizing psychological investment (compassion, fairness); Stage 2-Thinking through allyship-relevant complexities (intellectual humility, perspective-taking, wisdom); Stage 3-Initiating action (prudence, moral courage, honesty); Stage 4-Committing to allyship (perseverance, patience). We call this the 'EThIC model of virtue-based allyship development.' This study has implications for theory and research on a virtue-based approach to diversity, equity and inclusion.",Warren MA

Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,2023,1,Trajectories of medication use and polypharmacy among children with cerebral palsy.,"BACKGROUND: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) may have chronic exposure to polypharmacy to address several medical needs, but there is little research on the topic to inform surveillance methods and clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To identify the trajectories of medication number and pediatric polypharmacy (≥2 concurrent medications) exposure over 3.5 years among children with CP. METHODS: This cohort study used commercial claims from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018 (4-year period). Children with CP, aged 5-18 years by January 1, 2016, and with continuous health plan enrollment for all 4 years, were included and categorized as with or without co-occurring neurological/ RESULTS: Of the 1,252 children with CP, 600 were in the CP only cohort (mean [SD]; age, 11.4 [4.1] years; 46.0% female) and 652 were in the CP + NDDs cohort (age, 11.9 [4.1] years; 41.3% female; 32.7% had ≥2 of the NDDs). For the primary GBTM, 3 trajectory groups were identified for CP only: on average, no prescribed medications (69.7% of the cohort), 1 medication/month (24.8%), and 4 medications/month (5.5%). Five trajectory groups were identified for CP + NDDs: 0 (22.4%), 1 (25.6%), 2 (25.2%), 4 (18.4%), and 6 (8.4%) prescribed medications/month. For the secondary GBTM, 3 trajectory groups were identified for CP only: 80.5% were characterized as negligible probability of polypharmacy exposure, 10.8% as low probability, and 8.7% as high probability. Five trajectory groups were identified for CP + NDDs: 37.9% as negligible probability of polypharmacy exposure, 32.8% as constantly high probability, and 29.2% as changing probability (eg, increasing/decreasing). CONCLUSIONS: Children with CP are chronically exposed to differing levels of polypharmacy. Findings can help establish polypharmacy surveillance practices. Studies need to determine if polypharmaceutical strategies are balanced to optimize health and development for children with CP.

Since the NOCP was published in 2011, paramedic practice, healthcare, and society have changed dramatically. To inform the revision, we sought to identify emerging concepts in the literature that would inform the development of competencies for paramedics. We conducted a restricted literature review and content analysis of all published and grey literature pertaining to or informing Canadian paramedicine from 2011 to 2022. Three authors performed a title, abstract, and full-text review to identify and label concepts informed by existing findings. A total of 302 articles were categorized into 11 emerging concepts related to competencies: inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) in paramedicine; social responsiveness, justice, equity, and access; anti-racism; healthy professionals; evidence-informed practice and systems; complex adaptive systems; learning environment; virtual care; clinical reasoning; adaptive expertise; and planetary health.

International journal for equity in health,2022,12,"Intersectionality, health equity, and EDI: What's the difference for health researchers?","Many countries adopted comprehensive national initiatives to promote equity in higher education with the goal of transforming the culture of research. Major health research funders are supporting this work through calls for projects that focus on equity, resulting in a proliferation of theoretical frameworks including ""intersectionality,"" ""health equity,"" and variations of equity, diversity and inclusion, or EDI. This commentary is geared at individual principal investigators and health research teams who are developing research proposals and want to consider equity issues in their research, perhaps for the first time. We present histories and definitions of three commonly used frameworks: intersectionality, health equity, and EDI. In the context of health research, intersectionality is a methodology (a combination of epistemology and techniques) that can identify the relationships among individual identities and systems of oppression; however, it should also be used internally by research teams to reflect on the production of knowledge. Health equity is a societal goal that operationalizes the social determinants of health to document and address health disparities at the population level. EDI initiatives measure and track progress within organizations or teams and are best suited to inform the infrastructure and human resourcing ""behind the scenes"" of a project. We encourage researchers to consider these definitions and strive to tangibly move health research towards equity both in the topics we study and in the ways we do research.",Kelly C

Advances in health care management,2022,12,Learning Through Diversity: Creating a Virtuous Cycle of Health Equity in Health Care Organizations.,"In the US, a growing number of organizations and industries are seeking to affirm their commitment to and efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as recent events have increased attention to social inequities. As health care organizations are considering new ways to incorporate DEI initiatives within their workforce, the anticipated result of these efforts is a reduction in health inequities that have plagued our country for centuries. Unfortunately, there are few frameworks to guide these efforts because few successfully link organizational DEI initiatives with health equity outcomes. The purpose of this chapter is to review existing scholarship and evidence using an organizational lens to examine how health care organizations can advance DEI initiatives in the pursuit of reducing or eliminating health inequities. First, this chapter defines important terms of DEI and health equity in health care. Next, we describe the methods for our narrative review. We propose a model for understanding health care organizational activity and its impact on health inequities based in organizational learning that includes four interrelated parts: intention, action, outcomes, and learning. We summarize the existing scholarship in each of these areas and provide recommendations for enhancing future research. Across the body of knowledge in these areas, disciplinary and other silos may be the biggest barrier to knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Moving forward, scholars and practitioners should seek to collaborate further in their respective efforts to achieve health equity by creating formalized initiatives with linkages between practice and research communities.",Williams JH

Contributing factors include socioeconomic factors, gaps in educational exposure, and underrepresentation of minority groups in the dermatologic workforce. In 2021, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) announced its three-year plan to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion in dermatology. One way to reduce disparities in dermatology is for every dermatologist, regardless of race or ethnicity, to receive adequate education in diseases, treatments, health equity, and tailored approaches to delivering dermatologic care with cultural humility. In addition, a diverse dermatologic workforce-especially at the level of residency program educators and organizational leaders-will contribute to improved cross-cultural understanding, more inclusive research efforts, and improved treatment approaches for conditions that are more prevalent or nuanced in certain racial/ethnic populations. Finally, the dermatology and broader healthcare community needs to acknowledge and educate ourselves on the health impacts of racism.",Narla S

It is essential that diversity and inclusion in biomedicine is prioritized as a key driver of innovation, both through the people who conduct the research and the science itself. Key questions have been articulated as important drivers for funding research: (1) Who is doing the science and who is building the tools? (2) What science and technology is being done and how? and (3) Who has access to the knowledge and benefits of scientific innovation? I will briefly review the empirical evidence supporting diversity as a powerful enhancer of the quality and outputs of research and clinical care. I offer my own research as a case study of incorporating a framework of diversity, equity, and inclusion into research that uses new emerging genomic tools for earlier and more precise diagnosis of organ transplant rejection. I will demonstrate how these same tools hold great promise for accelerating the discovery of hitherto unexplored mechanisms that drive the poor outcomes for African ancestry organ transplant recipients, which in turn will identify new diagnostics and therapeutic targets that benefit transplant recipients across all ancestries.",Valantine HA

Journal of allied health,2022,12,White Faculty as True Allies in the Classroom: The JEDI Code.,"Healthcare education practices need to integrate values of justice, equity, diversity, inclusion (JEDI), and belonging to address the racism that continues to infiltrate society. The myths and incorrect assumptions about race in healthcare perpetuate patient care practices that are racially discriminatory and grow the inequitable healthcare crisis in the U.S. The response to abolish racism in healthcare begins with professional health education, and white allies are called to action by creating anti-racist classrooms. White allies in education can lead their classrooms to respond to racism by developing a JEDI Code that creates a learning environment of belonging. There are five aspects of leadership to create change that are investigated and applied to the development of anti-racist classrooms. The educator, as an anti-racist leader, serves as a change agent, role model, and ethical healthcare practitioner. A ""classroom of practice"" encourages a culture of belonging among students and creates a structure for all students to grow and develop in the anti-racist space. This commentary aims to acknowledge the culture of racism in healthcare and how it is propagated by current education practices in professional health education programs while investigating teaching and learning strategies that support the evolution of an anti-racist classroom.",Kessler A

Social science & medicine (1982),2022,12,The capability imperative: Theorizing ableism in medical education.,"Medical education programs profess commitments to justice, equity, and inclusion, seeking to diversify the profession and better serve patient populations. Although disability has more recently joined recognized categories of valued diversity, significant barriers remain for disabled learners in medicine. This paper develops the concept of the capability imperative, derived from a constructivist grounded theory study examining disability inclusion at four U.S. medical schools that analyzed technical standards policies and interviews with 19 disabled students and 27 school officials (faculty and administrators). Through three motifs (the selfless superhuman; the ""real world"" of medicine; and the malleable student), the capability imperative enforces the characteristics of a good physician, justifies institutional arrangements, and seeks to produce a learner who can conform to these expectations. Drawing on critical disability theories of ableism and crip theory, the paper argues that the capability imperative represents a context-specific manifestation of ableism that upholds a cultural logic of compulsory hyper-ablebodiedness and mindedness. This logic is antithetical to inclusive goals. Exploration of what constitutes a physician and whom this vision serves may help to shift the professional culture towards justice and unroot disabled peoples' ongoing marginalization in the medical profession.",Jain NR

Recent genetic and immunological studies have suggested that cutaneous inflammatory disorders (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa) and malignancies (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) may have variations in their immunophenotype among SOC. Additionally, there is growing recognition of the substantial role social determinants of health play in driving health inequalities in SOC communities. It is critically important to understand that social determinants of health often play a larger role than biologic or genetic factors attributed to ""race"" in health care outcomes. Herein, we describe the structural, genetic, and immunological variations and the potential implications of these variations in populations with SOC. This article underscores the importance of increasing the number of large, robust genetic studies of cutaneous disorders in SOC to create more targeted, effective therapies for this often underserved and understudied population.

While longstanding confusions and conflations of terminology in the sex and gender field are well documented, newer conceptual confusions and conflations continue to emerge. Contemporary social demands for improved health and equity, as well as increased interest in precision healthcare and medicine, have made obvious the need for sex and gender science, sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA+), considerations of intersectionality, and equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives (EDI) to broaden representation among participants and diversify research agendas. But without a shared and precise understanding of these conceptual areas, fields of study, and approaches and their inter-relationships, more conflation and confusion can occur.

Hence, the purpose of this report is to offer perspectives gained from the delivery of a DEI curriculum within a pharmacy residency program aimed at expanding experiential learning focused on DEI and health equity. Program Implementation: Pharmacy residents at an academic medical center were invited to participate in a longitudinal DEI/equity seminar series that was thoughtfully and strategically developed by a team of residents and program leadership based on a six-step process. Residents were offered 9 individual seminars covering 4 major focus areas to facilitate enhanced awareness, learning, and vulnerability. Participants were invited to provide evaluations of each seminar and the overall series. Program Assessment: A total of 41 residents (100%) participated in at least one of the 9 seminars that were offered and approximately 50% completed the post-series survey. Resident-perceived benefit of each individual session was consistently favorable. Additionally, greater than 70% of participants responded favorably when asked about the impact of each session on their awareness, resources provided, and ability to apply the learnings to their practice. Conclusion: Our inaugural experience with the integration of a DEI seminar series into a pharmacy residency program suggests that there is a clear benefit to including DEI/health equity into pharmacy residency training. This data may suggest that adoption of DEI-focused experiential training may increase cultural awareness and the availability of resources to better equip pharmacy residents in applying concepts of DEI into their practice.",Tillman F 3rd
Frontiers in medical technology,2022,11,Engaging patients and citizens in digital health technology development through the virtual space.,"Digital technologies are increasingly empowering individuals to take charge of their health and improve their well-being. However, there are disparities in access related to demographic, economic, and sociocultural factors that result in exclusion from the use of digital technologies for different groups of the population. The development of digital technology in health is a powerful lever for improving care and services, but also brings risks for certain users in vulnerable situations. Increased digital health inequalities are associated with limited digital literacy, lack of interest, and low levels of self-efficacy in using technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic healthcare systems, the leap to digital is essential. To foster responsible innovation and optimal use of digital health by all, including vulnerable groups, we propose that patient and citizen engagement must be an essential component of the research strategy. Patient partners will define expectations and establish research priorities using their experiential knowledge, while benefiting from rich exposure to the research process to increase their self-efficacy and digital literacy. We will support this proposition with an operationalised example aiming to implement a Virtual Community of Patients and Citizens Partners (COMVIP), a digital tool co-created with patients and public experts, as active team members in research. Founded on the principles of equity, diversity and inclusion, this base of citizen expertise will assemble individuals from different backgrounds and literacy levels living in vulnerable situations to acquire knowledge, and share their experiences, while contributing actively in the co-development of innovative strategies and health technology assessment.",Barony Sanchez RH
Psychological reports,2022,11,Validation of the Revised Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI-r) in the UK.,"As worldwide migration continues to grow, valid and reliable instruments are needed to assess the psychological processes that influence the successful management of intercultural relations in different sociopolitical contexts. In this study, we test whether the original Multicultural Ideology Scale (MCI) required a revision to remain 'fit for purpose' in the current culturally plural context of the UK (MCI-r). Specifically, six subscales are proposed to underlie the construct of a multicultural ideology: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. With data from 300 UK nationals, we tested the psychometric properties of the MCI-r using various confirmatory factor analysis techniques to estimate the scale's factor structure followed by convergent and discriminant validity tests. The results indicated that a 4-factor solution (Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social interaction, and Consequences of Diversity) fitted the data best. All four subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as convergent and discriminant validity. All four subscales were also negatively correlated with a right-wing political orientation, whilst especially Social Interaction and Consequences of Diversity were positively associated with intergroup contact frequency across domains (work, family and friends and/or acquaintances). Finally, UK participants with personal migratory experiences reported a stronger belief in positive consequences of multiculturalism and more support for Social Interactions between members of different ethnic groups. Overall, findings provide first insights into the applicability of the MCI-r as a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of multiculturalism within the present UK context.",Lefringhausen K
Perspectives on behavior science,2022,11,Teaching a Course on the History of Behavior Analysis.,"Teaching the history of behavior analysis can be approached in many ways. One is to embed history in courses on the field's discipline and subdisciplines (e.g., its basic and applied sciences and their conceptual foundations) and practice. Another is to teach courses on the histories of the discipline and subdisciplines and practice. Still another is to teach a stand-alone course that includes these approaches and more (e.g., their integration, relations with other sciences, the influence of U.S. history and culture). The purpose of this article is to foster teaching the stand-alone course. It has four sections. The first addresses structural considerations: course titles, catalog descriptions, curricula, certification, and accreditation. The second addresses contextual considerations: purposes of teaching history; distinctions between history and historiography; and starting points in selecting textbooks. The third addresses functional considerations: course content organized by topics and their required and recommended readings. The fourth discusses how the course might be revised by eliminating topics (e.g., the Middle Ages), expanding topics and subtopics (e.g., the behaviorisms, philosophy of science) and adding topics and subtopics (e.g., institutional history; diversity, inclusion, and equity). Given the field's continuing development as a science, system, and practice and the rapid growth in its number and variety of its members, its history is becoming its common core-and a means of teaching it. The course elucidates the field's integrity; incorporates the entirety of its community of students, scientists, scholars, and practitioners; and advance its coherence as a cultural practice.",Morris EK

The authors evaluate the traditional allocation of endowed chairs, which can attract and retain talented faculty and can support focused research far into the future, while other gifts may support more timely concerns, but over a shorter term. The authors weigh the benefits and challenges of allocation of endowed chairs, such as the need to improve representation, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and opportunities to support early-career investigators or research teams. New endowed positions can be challenging to establish, as there may be competition with learner scholarship programs and programmatic support. Leadership turnover of university presidents and deans can slow philanthropic growth and make recruitment and fundraising for new positions even more challenging. The authors discuss the balance of institutional priorities and ways to use endowed chairs for scholarship in evolving areas of medicine and science. They further suggest working with donors to develop more adaptable gift agreements, which will allow institutions to transform endowed positions to meet changing needs while preserving the intentions of the donor. To maintain endowed chairs as a worthwhile and relevant outlet for philanthropy, one which donors will enthusiastically support, it is essential to align them with the changing needs of the institution and the broader environment of academic medicine.",Buckley PF

Designing an Award for Underrepresented Medical Education Researchers.,"Meaningful Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) efforts may be stymied by concerns about whether proposed initiatives are performative or tokenistic. The purpose of this project was to analyze discussions by the Research in Medical Education (RIME) Program Planning committee about how best to recognize and support underrepresented in medicine (URiM) researchers in medical education to generate lessons learned that might inform local, national, and international actions to implement meaningful EDI initiatives. Ten RIME Program Planning Committee members and administrative staff participated in a focus group held virtually in August 2021. Focus group questions elicited opinions about ""if and how"" to establish a URiM research award. The focus group was recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Recognition of privilege, including who has it and who doesn't, underpinned the focus group discussion, which revolved around 2 themes: (1) tensions between optics and semantics, and (2) potential unintended consequences of trying to level the medical education playing field. The overarching storyline threaded throughout the focus group discussion was intentionality. Focus group participants sought to avoid performativity by creating an award that would be meaningful to recipients and to career gatekeepers such as department chairs and promotion and tenure committees. Ultimately, participants decided to create an award that focused on exemplary Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) scholarship, which was eventually named the ""RIME URiM Research Award.""

To evaluate how closely the planning adhered to the principles of health equity, we applied Ontario Health's Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, and Anti-Racism Framework to determine which areas of action were successfully addressed, and which areas of action require further focus. The framework contains 11 components, each delineating a key area of action. Using this framework helped identify areas where the principles of equity were well addressed, as well as pointing to additional areas where further efforts are required. Healthcare organizations must take a leadership role in advancing health equity by planning, delivering, improving, and advocating for the services and systematic changes that will allow its local community members to realize their highest attainable standard of health.

Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2022,11,Strategic communication as planned behavior for science and risk communication: A theory-based approach to studying communicator choice.,"This essay argues that we should treat science and risk communicators' choices about tactics, objectives, and goals as behaviors to advance both research and practice. Doing so allows for a discussion about how to use theories about behavior change and trust-building to help foster more strategic communication choices. The essay also seeks to anticipate and respond to potential arguments against using behavior change theories to encourage more strategic communication choices. We argue that it is possible to use behavior change tactics ethically if those tactics are aimed at increasing the likelihood that all participants in communication-including decisions makers like risk scientists-meaningfully engage with true, relevant information. Under the right conditions, such engagement is what should allow for the development of new knowledge, as well as a range of evidence-based evaluative beliefs, feelings, and frames. Being strategic when making choices about communication should also help with identifying situations in which justice, equity, diversity, or inclusion issues require additional attention. The essay concludes by noting that the difficulty of efficient and effective science and risk communication may require increased emphasis on getting experts such as scientists to collaborate with expert communication advisors. It may also be necessary to increase the capacity of science- and risk-focused communication practitioners.",Besley JC

JAAPA : official journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants,2022,11,"Assessing and benchmarking equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare professions.","Healthcare professions are among the fastest growing careers in the United States, but the issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion remain a challenge. The percentage of underrepresented minority groups is disproportionately small despite many efforts to increase workforce diversity over the past several decades. As the demographics in our nation are rapidly changing, increasing racial, ethnic, and cognitive diversity is crucial to achieving a workforce with the capacity to provide accessible and equitable healthcare. Given the growing evidence that a diverse workforce improves healthcare outcomes, fosters unique perspectives (cognitive diversity), and helps to reduce health disparities, there is an urgent need to address perennial barriers such as structural racism, biases, and stereotypes. Educational institutions should be held accountable to integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of healthcare professions education and practice. This article discusses potential areas for innovation and opportunities that can be leveraged in assessing and benchmarking equity, diversity, and inclusion in healthcare professions. The ability to thoroughly assess the PA profession's culture in relationship to diversity, equity, and inclusion provides an opportunity to determine how well the profession is performing, and to strategically plan for what else need to be done.",Kayingo G
Journal of pediatric surgery,2022,11,Inclusion and representation in the pediatric surgery workforce: Strategies to mitigate bias in the fellowship application process.,"Diverse perspectives are critical components of effective teams in every industry. Underrepresentation of minorities in medicine leads to worse outcomes for minority patients, and efforts to increase diversity in the health care workforce are critical. Presently, about 70% of the pediatric surgery workforce is white, and pediatric surgeons at large do not reflect the racial or ethnic diversity of the populations they serve. Pediatric surgery fellowship training programs are the gateway to the field, and fellow selection processes should be optimized to support diversity and inclusion. The Association of Pediatric Surgery Training Program Directors (APSTPD) Diversity Equity and Inclusion subcommittee compiled best practices for bias mitigation during fellow selection, drawing from published literature and personal experiences in our own programs. A list of concrete recommendations was compiled, which can be implemented in every phase from applicant screening to rank list creation. We present these as a position statement that has been endorsed by the executive committee of the APSTPD. Pediatric surgery fellowship programs can utilize this focused review of best practices to mitigate bias and support diverse applicants.",Berman L
Healthcare management forum,2022,11,The role of grassroots community organizations in transforming healthcare systems to achieve health equity.,"Two events converged in early 2020 to expose vast disparities and inequities that have been harming many racialized and marginalized people for decades and shake up healthcare systems around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and the brutal killing by police of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, created a groundswell of emotions that erupted in protests and calls for social justice. Governments, corporations, and businesses made statements against racism, primarily anti-Black racism, instituted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies, and appointed DEI managers to show they were taking action to tackle racism and uphold social justice. However, grassroots community organizations had the most impact in mobilizing populations and effecting change to contain and reduce the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus, as well as challenging leaders to do more than just talk about dismantling systemic, structural, and institutional racism.",Carter AJ

In response, the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) has been created in Canada to transform the patient's role in research from a passive beneficiary to a more proactive partner of change within the healthcare system. This research investigates what people new to Canada living with type 2 diabetes think about participating in research partnerships. Using an ethnographic approach, 31 people new to Canada with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were interviewed. Findings indicated that few people new to Canada were represented among the Diabetes Action Canada (DAC) Network's Circles of Patient Partners in Quebec. Barriers to engagement in research were: lack of information; competing priorities; language barrier and privacy concerns; preconceptions about being a patient partner; prejudices on research engagement as something demanding and binding; and the matter of religious and gender differences. Some participants questioned the extent to which involvement in research can really meet their expectations considering institutional control over research, funding requirements that often dictate priorities and the biomedical approach which still, in many respects, dominates health research. Implications for achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion of patient partners in research are discussed.",Balla S

Narayan discussing this article. Radiology practices nationwide have implemented diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs seeking to change the landscape of a field traditionally dominated by White men. However, measuring these programs' success is often challenging, and a lack of documented success may threaten such programs' ongoing growth. This article explores the application of metrics and overall concepts from the business world to assess the success of DEI programs in radiology practices. Metrics and processes are described for each area, including demographic data for measuring diversity, compensation and leadership representation data for measuring equity, and survey-based data for measuring inclusion. A practical data-driven framework is presented that radiology practices may adapt to their DEI programs. This framework is centered on critical assessment of a practice's current shortcomings and creation of leadership accountability to track progress and effect real change. Through the spectrum of considerations highlighted in this article, DEI programs can have a large impact in driving measurable success for radiology practices and ultimately the specialty at large.",Chekmeyan M
Frontiers in medicine,2022,10,For us by us: Instituting mentorship models that credit minoritized medical faculty expertise and lived experience.,"The woefully low proportion of scientists and clinicians underrepresented in medicine (UIM), including members of African-American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander communities, is well characterized and documented. Diversity in medicine is not only just, but it improves quality and outcomes. Yet, diversity in academic medicine remains stagnant, despite national recognition and urgent calls to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion across health sciences. One strategy that has shown to improve diversity in many sectors is high quality mentoring. While many institutions have adopted mentoring programs, there remains a lack of mentorship that is equitable, individualized, and sets a clear timeline for academic milestones that will position UIM mentees at the optimal trajectory for promotion and retention. A barrier to assembling these programs is the small number of UIM among the senior faculty ranks who are able to serve in this role, given the disproportionate burden to serve on a multitude of academic committees, task forces, and workgroups to fulfill institutional mandates to diversify representation. These time-consuming services, documented in the literature as the ""minority tax,"" are generally uncompensated and unaccounted for in terms of consideration for promotion, leadership positions, and other measures of career advancement. The Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Academic Mentors (JAM) Council represents a novel, culturally responsive, and anti-racist approach to achieve a more equitable and inclusive institutional environment. This approach strategically leverages the intergenerational wisdom and experience of senior UIM faculty via time-protected effort with the overall goals of improving rates of promotion, retention, and career satisfaction of early career UIM colleagues. This community case study describes the rationale, resources needed, processes, and proposed workflow required to launch the JAM Council, as well as the major roles and responsibilities for JAM mentors and mentees, which may be considered by academic medical centers focused on improving diversity among the faculty ranks.",Bath EP

Although women have comprised nearly 50% of all US medical school graduates since the early 2000s, gender disparities continue in many specialties and persist in medical education leadership. For women in anesthesiology, gender inequities exist along the academic pipeline, with greater disparity in the higher ranks of academia and leadership. Successful endeavors to improve gender equity in the specialty include increasing awareness, engaging in faculty development, and encouraging transparent promotions processes. The strides will be short and change will be slow unless we shift focus to when the gender imbalance begins-at the transition from undergraduate medical education to graduate medical education. Currently women comprise 37% of academic anesthesiology faculty; however, the current resident pool is only 33% women. If recruitment of a gender-equitable workforce at the undergraduate-to-graduate medical education transition is not a priority, the downstream measures will have minimal impact toward gender equity in academic anesthesiology.",Marroquin BM

PLoS computational biology,2022,10,Ten simple rules for creating and sustaining antiracist graduate programs.,"In 2020, the combination of police killings of unarmed Black people, including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about public outrage over long-standing inequalities in society. The events of 2020 ignited global attention to systemic racism and racial inequalities, including the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academy and especially in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Racial and ethnic diversity in graduate programs in particular warrants special attention as graduate students of color report experiencing alarming rates of racism, discrimination, microaggressions, and other exclusionary behaviors. As part of the Graduate Dean's Advisory Council on Diversity (GDACD) at the University of California Merced, the authors of this manuscript held a year-long discussion on these issues and ways to take meaningful action to address these persistent issues of injustices. We have outlined 10 rules to help graduate programs develop antiracist practices to promote racial and ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in the academy. We focus on efforts to address systemic causes of the underrepresentation and attrition of students from minoritized communities. The 10 rules are developed to allow graduate groups to formulate and implement rules and policies to address root causes of underrepresentation of minoritized students in graduate education.",Perez-Lopez E

Scientific reports,2022,10,Adapting and pretesting the World Health Organization's Caregiver Skills Training Program for children with autism and developmental disorders or delays in Hong Kong.,"The World Health Organization Caregiver Skills Training Program (WHO-CST) was developed to strengthen caregivers' skills in supporting children with developmental delays and the caregivers' well-being. The WHO-CST Hong Kong (HK) was adapted, and pre-pilot tested to support families with children suspected of having developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder and to empower the caregivers to foster their children's learning, social communication, and adaptive behavior. A sequential mixed-methods research methodology was undertaken to examine the adaptation process and initial implementation experiences. The acceptability, feasibility, and perceived benefits of the WHO-CST were assessed using stakeholders' and caregivers' qualitative and caregivers' quantitative pre- and post-intervention feedback. The data included materials generated from (1) three consultation meetings with stakeholders; (2) detailed reviews of the translated and adapted WHO-CST materials by master trainees (n = 10) trained by the WHO-CST representatives; (3) needs assessment focus group interviews with caregivers (n = 15) of children with autism spectrum disorder; and (4) pre- and post-CST program qualitative focus group interviews and quantitative evaluation. Consultation with stakeholders suggested that the program was acceptable for the local community, but the home visit and fidelity components were initially considered to be challenges towards the feasibility and sustainability of the program. Caregivers in the needs assessment focus groups gave widely diverse views about the program's uniqueness, length, delivery mode, and the inclusion of videotaping in-home visits. Post-intervention comments by caregivers about the program were mainly positive, while the MTs were critical of the content and length of the training and fidelity process. As one of the first high-income locations to adopt the WHO-CST, the evaluation findings of the WHO-CST-HK indicate that it is feasible and acceptable to implement the program in a metropolitan area where families have busy work schedules and are very conscious of privacy issues. The study results suggest that the WHO-CST program in HK and other high-income countries require scaling up and further evaluation of its implementation in real community settings. This involves systemic and contextual changes to allow task-sharing between professionals and non-specialists at the macro level. Furthermore, technology should be used to support the supervision of non-specialists. In addition, easier access to the WHO-CST materials at the micro level is required to ensure equity, equality, diversity, and inclusion of diversified families of children with developmental delays.",Wong PW

After multiple revisions, the final definition is as follows: School psychology research is the systematic investigation of phenomena concerning the educational, emotional, behavioral, and social outcomes, as well as the school, family, and societal systems in which these outcomes are imbedded. It is principally concerned with socially responsive implementation and translating research into equitable practices that can lead to improved functioning of students, families, schools, and community systems that support educational and psychological services. It includes basic and applied research and theory development that focuses on a wide array of topics including, for example, prevention, intervention, assessment, diagnosis, diversity, equity and inclusion, measurement, methodology, statistics, and professional issues. This wide range of topics is informed by diverse theories arising from a broad array of disciplines and investigated by researchers from a variety of educational and scientific backgrounds. Common to all of the areas of research inquiry is a focus on enhancing student, family, and community outcomes-particularly educational and social outcomes of all students-and in building the capacity of systems (schools, communities, and other systems) to support those outcomes with a commitment to incorporating social responsiveness in the research process. The aim of this definition is to embrace the breadth of scholarship informing and advancing the science, practice, and policy relevant to the field of school psychology.",Volpe RJ

AI & society,2022,9,The cyclical ethical effects of using artificial intelligence in education.,"Our synthetic review of the relevant and related literatures on the ethics and effects of using AI in education reveals five qualitatively distinct and interrelated divides associated with access, representation, algorithms, interpretations, and citizenship. We open our analysis by probing the ethical effects of algorithms and how teams of humans can plan for and mitigate bias when using AI tools and techniques to model and inform instructional decisions and predict learning outcomes. We then analyze the upstream divides that feed into and fuel the algorithmic divide, first investigating access (who does and does not have access to the hardware, software, and connectivity necessary to engage with AI-enhanced digital learning tools and platforms) and then representation (the factors making data either representative of the total population or over-representative of a subpopulation's preferences, thereby preventing objectivity and biasing understandings and outcomes). After that, we analyze the divides that are downstream of the algorithmic divide associated with interpretation (how learners, educators, and others understand the outputs of algorithms and use them to make decisions) and citizenship (how the other divides accumulate to impact interpretations of data by learners, educators, and others, in turn influencing behaviors and, over time, skills, culture, economic, health, and civic outcomes). At present, lacking ongoing reflection and action by learners, educators, educational leaders, designers, scholars, and policymakers, the five divides collectively create a vicious cycle and perpetuate structural biases in teaching and learning. However, increasing human responsibility and control over these divides can create a virtuous cycle that improves diversity, equity, and inclusion in education. We conclude the article by looking forward and discussing ways to increase educational opportunity and effectiveness for all by mitigating bias through a cycle of progressive improvement.",Dieterle E

"Surgery journal (New York, N.Y.)",2022,9,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Orthopaedic Surgery Residency Match.,"Introduction  Matching into an orthopaedic surgery residency program presents a challenging accomplishment for applicants to achieve in any given year. Due to the profound changes to the application process caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic it was theorized that there would be a change in the number of graduates matching close to their home medical school region, state, and program. Methods  Orthopaedic surgery residency program Web sites and social media accounts were accessed to elucidate current resident data, including graduates' medical school, and geographical location of their school. Chi-square analysis was performed to identify trends in current residents matching within their home program, state, and region associated with the 2021 orthopaedic match. These numbers were compared with previous year's successful applicants. Results  In 2021, a significant 4.4% ( p =0.02) increase in successful matches within applicants' home states occurred (33.4% vs. 37.8%) and home programs ( p <0.001) when compared with previous years (21.2% vs. 27.4%). However, in 2021, there was no significant change in home region matching ( p =0.56) with 60% of successful matches occurring in home regions. This was statistically consistent with what was observed in previous years (61.4%). Conclusion  The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with restrictions in travel and interview options resulting in a significant increase in the number of orthopaedic applicants who matched into their home program, or at programs in their home state compared with previous years.

Frontiers in public health,2022,9,Increasing Latinx representation in the US medical schools: A top-ranked medical school's experience.,"Despite the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the general US population, many, if not most, medical schools fall short of matriculating students reflective of this change in diversity. The Latinx community constitutes nearly 20% of the US population and is expected to rise substantially in the coming decades. Over the past 20 years, the number of Latinx students applying to and being admitted to medical school has grown but remains below 4% of the total medical student body composition. Several factors contribute to the under-representation of Latinx students in medical schools that include access to secondary education, finances, lack of mentorship or advice, and a multitude of other structural inequities and system-level biases. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are often named as key pillars of workforce development across the US medical schools and academic institutions. Despite significant efforts, medical schools continue to have low Latinx representation within their student body, and recruitment efforts often lack sustainability. In this manuscript, we share our experience of increasing Latinx student representation within a top-ranked medical school in the US southeast region. We have discussed the barriers we faced in enrolling and attracting Latinx students' amidst similar under-representation of Latinx faculty, staff, and leadership and the challenges of financial support for applicants and financial aid packages for admitted students. The strategies we implemented to achieve an increased representation of Latinx students in the School of Medicine (SOM) included revitalizing the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA), ensuring Latinx student representation within the SOM admission committee that included Latinx faculty as active participants in recruitment and retention efforts, redesigning the medical Spanish course, and creating dedicated outreach plans during second look weekend for interested Latinx students and active outreach to applicants and accepted students by current students. In combination, these efforts led to a significant increase in Latinx representation in the SOM student body from 2.6% in 2009 to 12.2% in 2021. We will conclude by discussing our ongoing challenges and our approach to sustain and improve Latinx representation in our medical school.",Corsino L

Journal of clinical and translational science,2022,9,"Undue burden: Black faculty, COVID-19, and the racial justice movement.","A crucial reckoning was initiated when the COVID-19 pandemic began to expose and intensify long-standing racial/ethnic health inequities, all while various sectors of society pursued racial justice reform. As a result, there has been a contextual shift towards broader recognition of systemic racism, and not race, as the shared foundational driver of both societal maladies. This confluence of issues is of particular relevance to Black populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic and racial injustice. In response, institutions have initiated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts as a way forward. This article considers how the dual pandemic climate of COVID-19-related health inequities and the racial justice movement could exacerbate the ""time and effort tax"" on Black faculty to engage in DEI efforts in academia and biomedicine. We discuss the impact of this ""tax"" on career advancement and well-being, and introduce an operational framework for considering the interconnected influence of systemic racism, the dual pandemics, and DEI work on the experience of Black faculty. If not meaningfully addressed, the ""time and effort tax"" could contribute to Black and other underrepresented minority faculty leaving academia and biomedicine - consequently, the very diversity, equity, and inclusion work meant to increase representation could decrease it.",Layne TM
Development and psychopathology,2022,9,"A review of mental health disparities during COVID-19: Evidence, mechanisms, and policy recommendations for promoting societal resilience.","Social and economic inequality are chronic stressors that continually erode the mental and physical health of marginalized groups, undermining overall societal resilience. In this comprehensive review, we synthesize evidence of greater increases in mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among socially or economically marginalized groups in the United States, including (a) people who are low income or experiencing homelessness, (b) racial and ethnic minorities, (c) women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) communities, (d) immigrants and migrants, (e) children and people with a history of childhood adversity, and (f) the socially isolated and lonely. Based on this evidence, we propose that reducing social and economic inequality would promote population mental health and societal resilience to future crises. Specifically, we propose concrete, actionable recommendations for policy, intervention, and practice that would bolster five ""pillars"" of societal resilience: (1) economic safety and equity, (2) accessible healthcare, including mental health services, (3) combating racial injustice and promoting respect for diversity, equity, and inclusion, (4) child and family protection services, and (5) social cohesion.

Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,2022,9,An Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) Framework for Teaching Cultural Humility: A Guide for Translating ACT from a Therapeutic Context into a Medical Education Curriculum.,"The objective of this project was to train future physicians to work effectively and thoughtfully with diverse populations by teaching them to employ Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) skills to increase cultural humility, with the goal of improving attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about working with diverse patients. We developed ACT for cultural humility online interactive modules as part of an elective course to teach Medical Spanish to 4th-year medical students. Pre- and post-pilot data pertaining to the cultural humility training modules on the Work-Related Acceptance and Action questionnaire, Multidimensional Cultural Humility Scale, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We also included descriptive data pertaining to overall satisfaction with the cultural humility modules and intent to apply the material learned to patient care. Our data showed a significant increase in the cultural humility of our participants as well as an increase in psychological flexibility, a higher favorability rating toward various ethnicities, improvements in attitude, and positive changes in beliefs and knowledge following completion of the modules. The modules were well received by the medical students, with high social validity ratings. The ACT for cultural humility curriculum has great potential to enhance medical education in diversity, equity, and inclusion by increasing both the understanding and the cultural humility of medical students and future professionals to work with diverse populations. The current paper provides a framework that can be used by other programs to shape the education of the future medical workforce to help promote culturally humble care.",Lombardero A
AORN journal,2022,9,Health Disparities Experienced by Surgical Patients of Color: What is Known and Key Actions to Take.,"In July of 2020, AORN created a comprehensive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion plan that includes a patient-focused committee whose goal is to improve the care, experience, and outcomes of each patient by providing relevant information, education, and resources about diversity, equity, and inclusion to the perioperative team. To gain insight into racial disparities in the surgical setting, the committee conducted a literature search and identified relevant evidence. As in health care in general, disparities in surgical care and outcomes exist between patients of color and their white counterparts. The reasons are multifactorial and interconnected, with contributing factors related to the patient, health care providers, the health care system, and surgical and postoperative care. Disparities can occur at any point along the perioperative continuum. Research conducted during the past 10 years supports the existence of disparities in the surgical setting and across surgical specialties, but few researchers have recommended strategies that perioperative teams can implement for improvement. The white paper identifies disparities in the surgical setting, actions that facilities and perioperative teams can take to mitigate disparities, and information gaps that should be the focus of future research. Perioperative team members and health care organizations are ethically responsible to lead the development and implementation of changes in health care settings and in public and health policies that address disparities in surgical care and outcomes.",Spruce L

Not unlike many educational materials, nursing texts are socially situated and often reflect dominant discourses of white supremacy, patriarchy, colonialism, cis/heteronormativity, gender binaries, and ableism. In addition to conveying what institutions and educators value, the discourses that are mediated through text socialize students in their ways of thinking and acting. There is a collective responsibility to critically examine how and why particular discourses persistently permeate texts used in nursing education. Open educational resources, as one type of text in nursing, are often touted as symbols of social justice because they are accessible for use by diverse learners and can be adapted to suit educators' needs.",Lapum J
Qualitative health research,2022,9,The Emotional and Psychological Labor of Insider Qualitative Research Among Systemically Marginalized Groups: Revisiting the Uses of Reflexivity.,"In response to decades-long exclusionary practices, academic institutions are now recruiting early career researchers (ECRs) from systemically marginalized populations who specialize in equity-related research. As a result, these ECRs are likely to conduct research within their communities on topics that have personal relevance-insider research. Methodological training for insider research places an emphasis on methods, such as reflexivity, to ensure rigor; however, the emotional and psychological impacts of these research methods on the researcher are seldom discussed. Therefore, I use analytic autoethnography to illustrate the embodied impacts of conducting insider research using an example of personal relevance and argue that methodological practices require an embodied reflexivity that centers the researcher and the impacts the research has on them. This paradoxically rewarding and taxing work necessitates changes in methodological training and practice, institutional support, and an openness to innovation when calling for equity, diversity, and inclusion in the academy.",Kinitz DJ
Journal of dental education,2022,9,LGBTQ+ and dental education: Analyzing the present and recommendations for the future.,"LGBTQ+ populations constitute increasing proportions of children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, this group suffers from health inequities, including oral health. The report ""Oral Health: Advances and Challenges"" identified the LGBTQ+ community as an underserved population which faces significant barriers in accessing oral health care. Coverage of LGBTQ+ topics in formal education settings in both dental schools and dental hygiene programs is scarce, which contributes to inequities within this group. Increasing curriculum content related to LGBTQ+ populations is of utmost importance to promote optimal patient-provider interactions while improving oral health outcomes. Ensuring equity in oral health care provision will require deliberate, consistent efforts on the part of all stakeholders. Dental and allied dental education programs have made important strides in enhancing equity and inclusion in their institutions by engaging campus groups that support LGBTQ+ populations, creating mentorship programs, and collaborating with non-profit advocacy groups. Such efforts have successfully empowered LGBTQ+ patients, providers, and allies who are committed to further closing the knowledge gap. Most of the research regarding LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts have been done in the medical arena and there is a void in the data available from the dental profession. To fill this void, recommendations are offered that institutions can easily implement to expand LGBTQ+ diversity and inclusion visibility.",Haley CM

As educational systems have not kept pace with the demographics and economic trends, there is a call to action to affirm the need to establish policies that support diversity within pipeline pathways, faculty recruitment, and retention. Leveraging knowledge and networking across institutions with communities can transform academic cultures, reduce unconscious/implicit bias, and microaggression. As racism exists in every segment of our culture, building sustainable capacity and a system proportional to the populations' relative needs can help chart a direction forward for policies that support justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion among dental institutions.",Swann BJ
Prehospital emergency care,2022,9,Characteristics and Experiences of Women Physicians and Professionals in NAEMSP.,"Introduction: One of the six guiding principles of the EMS Agenda 2050 is to foster a socially equitable care delivery system. A specific recommendation within this principle is that ""local EMS leadership, educators and clinicians [should] reflect the diversity of their communities."" Research has shown that women comprise a minority of emergency medicine services (EMS) field clinicians. In academic settings, women are represented at lower rates among experienced EMS faculty than within Emergency Medicine clinicians or faculty at large. The reasons for these differences are also unknown. Little data exist describing the number or experience of female physicians and professionals in EMS. Purpose: Our objective was to describe the composition and experiences of EMS physicians, researchers and professionals who participate in the Women in EMS group of the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP). Methods : We performed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods descriptive study of women belonging to the Women in EMS Committee of NAEMSP. A survey was sent to the 143 members of this group using a list-serve, and the data was collected in Redcap. Results: Seventy-four people completed the survey. Respondents were 96% female, 82% Caucasian, 11% underrepresented minorities (URM), and 7% LGBTQI. Of the 88% that are physicians, 78% are board certified in Emergency Medicine, compared to 55% in EMS. Forty-eight percent reported they received some form of mentorship. Among these respondents, a minority reported female mentorship, which was usually from a remote rather than local mentor (41% vs. 15%). Eighty-three percent of respondents had experienced some form of discrimination or harassment in their career, but only 68% reported their workplace culture discourages such behavior. Thirty-three percent of respondents report receiving unequal recognition because of gender. Thematic evaluation of the qualitative responses showed that respondents felt there were fewer barriers to mentorship and professional advancement opportunities in local work versus national engagement. Conclusions: In a survey evaluating representation of female professionals in EMS, participants reported on their career representations, and experiences of gender-based inequity within their EMS career settings. Several opportunities exist to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion for women in EMS based on our findings.",Staats K

International journal of environmental research and public health,2021,8,Big Data for Biomedical Education with a Focus on the COVID-19 Era: An Integrative Review of the Literature.,"Medical education refers to education and training delivered to medical students in order to become a practitioner. In recent decades, medicine has been radically transformed by scientific and computational/digital advances-including the introduction of new information and communication technologies, the discovery of DNA, and the birth of genomics and post-genomics super-specialties (transcriptomics, proteomics, interactomics, and metabolomics/metabonomics, among others)-which contribute to the generation of an unprecedented amount of data, so-called 'big data'. While these are well-studied in fields such as medical research and methodology, translational medicine, and clinical practice, they remain overlooked and understudied in the field of medical education. For this purpose, we carried out an integrative review of the literature. Twenty-nine studies were retrieved and synthesized in the present review. Included studies were published between 2012 and 2021. Eleven studies were performed in North America: specifically, nine were conducted in the USA and two studies in Canada. Six studies were carried out in Europe: two in France, two in Germany, one in Italy, and one in several European countries. One additional study was conducted in China. Eight papers were commentaries/theoretical or perspective articles, while five were designed as a case study. Five investigations exploited large databases and datasets, while five additional studies were surveys. Two papers employed visual data analytical/data mining techniques. Finally, other two papers were technical papers, describing the development of software, computational tools and/or learning environments/platforms, while two additional studies were literature reviews (one of which being systematic and bibliometric).The following nine sub-topics could be identified: (I) knowledge and awareness of big data among medical students; (II) difficulties and challenges in integrating and implementing big data teaching into the medical syllabus; (III) exploiting big data to review, improve and enhance medical school curriculum; (IV) exploiting big data to monitor the effectiveness of web-based learning environments among medical students; (V) exploiting big data to capture the determinants and signatures of successful academic performance and counteract/prevent drop-out; (VI) exploiting big data to promote equity, inclusion, and diversity; (VII) exploiting big data to enhance integrity and ethics, avoiding plagiarism and duplication rate; (VIII) empowering medical students, improving and enhancing medical practice; and, (IX) exploiting big data in continuous medical education and learning. These sub-themes were subsequently grouped in the following four major themes/topics: namely, (I) big data and medical curricula; (II) big data and medical academic performance; (III) big data and societal/bioethical issues in biomedical education; and (IV) big data and medical career. Despite the increasing importance of big data in biomedicine, current medical curricula and syllabuses appear inadequate to prepare future medical professionals and practitioners that can leverage on big data in their daily clinical practice. Challenges in integrating, incorporating, and implementing big data teaching into medical school need to be overcome to facilitate the training of the next generation of medical professionals. Finally, in the present integrative review, state-of-art and future potential uses of big data in the field of biomedical discussion are envisaged, with a focus on the still ongoing ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been acting as a catalyst for innovation and digitalization.",Khamisy-Farah R

The oncologist,2021,6,Overcoming Disparities in Cancer: A Need for Meaningful Reform for Hispanic and Latino Cancer Survivors.,"Hispanic and Latino (HL) cancer survivors are at a critical disadvantage compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients regarding sociodemographic adversities and access to equitable treatment options. By 2030, there will be about four million HL cancer survivors in the U.S., representing nearly 20% of survivors in this country. Hispanics and Latinos are subjected to significant challenges in accessing and receiving equitable care relative to NHWs. Hispanics and Latinos also experience lower rates of health insurance and financial resources, limiting health care options. These disparities often originate from disparate social determinants of health, including lower funding for education and school programs, greater neighborhood stressors and violence, lower access to healthy and affordable food, and greater barriers to community health and exercise opportunities. Even among HL cancer survivors with proper access to health care, they experience disparate treatment options, including low inclusion in clinical trials and/or access to experimental therapies. A solution to these barriers necessitates complex and systemic changes that involve, for example, investing in public health programs, increasing the diversity and cultural awareness of the medical workforce, and promoting research opportunities such as clinical trials that are inclusive of HLs. Only through meaningful reform will equitable cancer care be available for all in the U.S. regardless of racial and/or ethnic background. This article reviews some of the critical social determinants of health and biases relevant to HL cancer survivors and provides recommendations for achieving cancer health equity. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Hispanics and Latinos experience a significant and often disproportionate cancer-related burden compared with non-Hispanic and Latino White individuals and other racial and ethnic groups. Meaningful reform to achieve health equity in oncology should focus on approaches to gaining trust among diverse patients, cultural and community sensitivity and engagement in oncology care and research, diversifying the workforce, and improving inclusion in clinical trial participation. Taken together, these recommendations can lead to exemplary and equitable care for all patients.",Kronenfeld JP

This paper interprets the literature on Lp(a) and ancestral risk to support: 1) clinicians on understanding cardiovascular disease risk in different ancestral groups; 2) trialists for the design of clinical trials to ensure adequate ancestral diversity to support broad conclusions of drug effects; 3) regulators in the evaluation of the design and interpretation of results of Lp(a)-lowering trials with different Lp(a) inclusion thresholds; and 4) clinical laboratories to measure Lp(a) by assays that discriminate risk thresholds appropriately.",Tsimikas S

Journal of microbiology & biology education,2022,8,The PULSE Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Rubric: a Tool To Help Assess Departmental DEI Efforts.,"In an attempt to redesign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments to be more inclusive of all student populations, institutions of higher learning are reviewing their programs, policies, and the ways they engage students. The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) has been working with STEM departments over the past 10 years to improve the student experience by incorporating evidence-based teaching practices and creating curricula with a deeper focus on conceptual understanding of scientific principles, competencies, and the process of science. PULSE created the PULSE rubrics, a set of five rubrics designed to assist life sciences departments in assessing their implementation of the recommendations of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Vision and Change report in the areas of curriculum, assessment, faculty practice and faculty support, infrastructure, and climate for change. An additional rubric, on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), is described in this paper. Each of the 13 criteria of the PULSE DEI rubric begins with a context section of background information with references and a scale of 0 to 4 (baseline to exemplar) with descriptors for each score. The PULSE DEI rubric has been added to allow departments to determine the starting point for their DEI work and reveal areas that require attention. All PULSE rubrics can be accessed from the PULSE Community website (https://www.pulse-community.org/rubrics).",Brancaccio-Taras L

To envision a path towards this future, in January 2019 a diverse group of researchers, educators, students, and administrators gathered to hear and share personal perspectives on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the plant sciences. From these broad perspectives, the group developed strategies and identified tactics to facilitate and support EDI within and beyond the plant science community. The workshop leveraged scenario planning and the richness of its participants to develop recommendations aimed at promoting systemic change at the institutional level through the actions of scientific societies, universities, and individuals and through new funding models to support research and training. While these initiatives were formulated specifically for the plant science community, they can also serve as a model to advance EDI in other disciplines. The proposed actions are thematically broad, integrating into discovery, applied and translational science, requiring and embracing multidisciplinarity, and giving voice to previously unheard perspectives. We offer a vision of barrier-free access to participation in science, and a plant science community that reflects the diversity of our rapidly changing nation, and supports and invests in the training and well-being of all its members. The relevance and robustness of our recommendations has been tested by dramatic and global events since the workshop. The time to act upon them is now.",Henkhaus NA

Our department in the University of Washington School of Public Health undertook a systematic effort to begin addressing institutionalized racism and inclusive teaching in our courses. In July 2020, we introduced a new tool (the ""Course Development Plan"" (CDP)) to advance our curriculum. The CDP includes 2 components: 1) a guideline document that provides strategies on how to modify curricula and classroom teaching to incorporate antiracism and principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI); and 2) a structured worksheet for instructors to share EDI and antiracism practices they already incorporate and practices they plan to incorporate into their classes. Worksheets for each class are submitted prior to the beginning of the quarter and are reviewed by a peer faculty member and at least 1 epidemiology student; reviewers provide written feedback on the CDP worksheet. Further evaluation to assess the impact of the CDP process on classroom climate is ongoing. In this commentary, we discuss our department's efforts, the challenges we faced, and our hopes for next steps.",Seiler J

Worldwide female leadership was also queried via publicly available data. The survey was e-mailed to 1312 ILTS members, 199 responses (40.7% female) were collected from 38 countries (15.2% response rate). Almost half were surgeons (45.7%), 27.6% hepatologists and 26.6% anesthetists. Among 856 LT programs worldwide, 8.2% of leadership positions were held by females, and 22% of division chiefs were female across all specialties. Sixty-eight of respondents (34.7%) reported some form of discrimination during training or at their current position, presumably related to gender/sexual orientation (20.6%), race/country of origin (25.2%) and others (7.1%). Less than half (43.7%) received mentorship when discrimination occurred. An association between female responses and discrimination, differences in compensation, and job promotion was observed.

The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,2022,8,Advancing Curriculum Development and Design in Health Professions Education: A Health Equity and Inclusion Framework for Education Programs.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing health inequities in vulnerable and marginalized patient populations. Continuing professional development (CPD) can be a critical driver of change to improve quality of care, health inequities, and system change. In order for CPD to address these disparities in care for patient populations most affected in the health care system, CPD programs must first address issues of equity and inclusion in their education development and delivery. Despite the need for equitable and inclusive CPD programs, there remains a paucity of tools and frameworks available in the literature to guide CPD and broader education providers on how best to develop and deliver equitable and inclusive education programs. In this article, we describe the development and application of a Health Equity and Inclusion (HEI) Framework for education and training grounded in the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate model for instructional design. Using a case example, specifically a hospital-wide trauma-informed de-escalation for safety program, we demonstrate how the HEI Framework can be applied practically to CPD programs to support equity and inclusion in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation phases of education program delivery. The case example illustrates how the HEI Framework can be used by CPD providers to respect learner diversity, improve accessibility for all learners, foster inclusion, and address biases and stereotypes. We suggest that the HEI Framework can serve as an educational resource for CPD providers and health professions educators aiming to create equitable and inclusive CPD programs.",Agic B

Before 2016, the focus of patient advocate input on clinical trial concept evaluation was assessing accrual feasibility. By leveraging informal benchmarking and an outside-in perspective, the NCI patient advocate steering committee, comprised of NCI scientific steering committee and task force advocates, has recalibrated research advocacy within and across its clinical trial concepts. Additionally, by focusing on research advocacy fundamentals, the NCI patient advocate steering committee clarified the scope of the research advocate roles, focused its mission, defined and developed competencies, measured engagement, and created collateral and processes that support better interactions and greater value generation. Continuous improvement in the collateral and the underlying approaches, along with calibrating their application and monitoring results, will be necessary to keep pace with the science and further enhance the value of cancer clinical trial research advocacy. The road ahead should build on these fundamentals and include increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical trial and research advocacy participants and the supporting infrastructure.",Bangs R

Along with this critically important goal, it is imperative that we acknowledge gender is more expansive than a binary category because it represents a spectrum of gender identities. The discussion of this spectrum is lacking in our conversations around gender diversity and equity in radiology. Addressing equity for people of all gender identities is beneficial for us all. We define three key areas of focus: (1) improving fundamental knowledge about gender diversity and application of this knowledge in education, (2) recruiting and retaining gender-diverse physicians and (3) specific diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policy to support gender-affirming environments. Improved understanding and inclusion of the full spectrum of gender in these areas will improve diversity and equity, and, in turn, enhance creativity and innovation in radiology.",Zavaletta V

A radiology department's online presence and use of gender-inclusive language are essential in promoting an environment of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). The naming of radiology fellowships and continuing medical education (CME) courses with terminology such as ""Women's Imaging"" indicates a lack of inclusivity to TGNB patients and providers, which could result in suboptimal patient care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all institutions in Canada and the United States (US) offering training in Breast Imaging, Women's Imaging, or Breast and Body Imaging. Data was collected from each institution's radiology department website pertaining to fellowship names, EDI involvement, and CME courses. Results: 8 Canadian and 71 US radiology fellowships were identified. 75% of Canadian and 90% of US fellowships had gender-inclusive names. One (12.5%) Canadian and 29 (41%) US institutions had EDI Committees mentioned on their websites. Among institutions publicly displaying CME courses about breast/body or women's imaging, gender-inclusive names were used in only 1 (25%) of the Canadian CME courses, compared to 81% of the US institutions. Conclusions: Most institutions in Canada and the US have gender-inclusive names for their radiology fellowships pertaining to breast and body imaging. However, there is much opportunity to and arguably the responsibility for institutions in both countries to increase the impact and visibility of their EDI efforts through creation of department-specific committees and CME courses.",Yan TD

Pathogens and disease,2022,7,The role of mentoring in promoting diversity equity and inclusion in STEM Education and Research.,"The success of mentoring derives from active and respectful listening and the willingness to learn and accept opportunities for personal growth. This shapes every trainee and their destined path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The act of cultivating rapport, asking, and pondering meaningful questions, and receiving constructive feedback are critical to support a productive mentoring relationship. Successful mentoring in STEM can be established and allow mentees, especially underrepresented minorities (URMs), to flourish in an environment where they feel welcomed and supported. However, mentees from underrepresented groups often experience inadequate mentoring due to a mentor's lack of awareness, poor trainings themselves, or lack of understanding of the mentee's hardships. It is important for mentors and mentees to work together to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM education through creativity, authenticity, and networking. We analyzed data obtained from students who attended a recent workshop that are interested in going to graduate school. Our results show that despite low initial expectations for the workshop, many students were satisfied in the knowledge they gleaned. The future and role of diversity in STEM within these underrepresented groups lies in community support and an important role that they can play in the lives of others through DEI initiatives and throughout their careers all of which involves positive mentoring.",Marshall AG
Psychological review,2022,7,"Open science: Friend, foe, or both to an antiracist psychology?","The open science framework has garnered increased visibility and has been partially implemented in recent years. Open science underscores the importance of transparency and reproducibility to conduct rigorous science. Recently, several journals published by the American Psychological Association have begun adopting the open science framework. At the same time, the field of psychology has been reckoning with the current sociopolitical climate regarding anti-Blackness and White supremacy. As psychology begins to adopt the open science framework into its journals, the authors underscore the importance of embracing and aligning open science with frameworks and theories that have the potential to move the field toward antiracism and away from the embedded White supremacy value systems and ideals. The present article provides an overview of the open science framework; an examination of White supremacy ideology in research and publishing; guidance on how to move away from these pernicious values; and a proposal on alternate value systems to center equity, diversity, and inclusion with the aim of establishing an antiracist open science framework.

Research integrity and peer review,2022,7,"Improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in academia.","There are growing bodies of evidence demonstrating the benefits of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) on academic and organizational excellence. In turn, some editors have stated their desire to improve the EDI of their journals and of the wider scientific community. The Royal Society of Chemistry established a minimum set of requirements aimed at improving EDI in scholarly publishing. Additionally, several resources were reported to have the potential to improve EDI, but their effectiveness and feasibility are yet to be determined. In this commentary we suggest six approaches, based on the Royal Society of Chemistry set of requirements, that journals could implement to improve EDI. They are: (1) adopt a journal EDI statement with clear, actionable steps to achieve it; (2) promote the use of inclusive and bias-free language; (3) appoint a journal's EDI director or lead; (4) establish a EDI mentoring approach; (5) monitor adherence to EDI principles; and (6) publish reports on EDI actions and achievements. We also provide examples of journals that have implemented some of these strategies, and discuss the roles of peer reviewers, authors, researchers, academic institutes, and funders in improving EDI.",Dewidar O
Infant mental health journal,2022,7,Mind the Gap(s): Reflective supervision/consultation as a mechanism for addressing implicit bias and reducing our knowledge gaps.,"Mental health-related professions, like many fields, have begun reexamining common practices and opportunities following the 2020 reawakening to the need for antiracist practices/policies. This push includes encouraging both seasoned professionals and newer trainees to do inward and outward work to increase self- and other-awareness and recognize biases. Often, it is unclear where to begin, and this deeper reflection can bring up uncomfortable realizations about oneself, colleagues, and even broader professions. Doing this deep work is most beneficial when done in a community that can provide support and further challenge. Thus, the practice of reflective supervision/consultation (RSC) is well-suited for integration of conversations about bias (implicit and explicit) as well as racism/antiracism. The current paper provides background on these concepts, the model of RSC, and specific examples of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles within the infant and early childhood mental health (IECMH) field. Parallels are drawn to existing ""key concepts"" of reflective supervision to provide examples for integrating conversations about bias into reflective supervision. Finally, specific tools and strategies for use are offered as starting points, with encouragement for supervisors to continue to generate ideas and tools for these important conversations. Next steps and implications for broader practice are also discussed.",Lingras KA
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2022,7,"Critical Theory, Culture Change, and Achieving Health Equity in Health Care Settings.","Achieving optimal health for all requires confronting the complex legacies of colonialism and white supremacy embedded in all institutions, including health care institutions. As a result, health care organizations committed to health equity must build the capacity of their staff to recognize the contemporary manifestations of these legacies within the organization and to act to eliminate them. In a culture of equity, all employees-individually and collectively-identify and reflect on the organizational dynamics that reproduce health inequities and engage in activities to transform them. The authors describe 5 interconnected change strategies that their medical center uses to build a culture of equity. First, the medical center deliberately grounds diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts (DEI) in critical theory, aiming to illuminate social structures through critical analysis of power relations. Second, its training goes beyond cultural competency and humility to include critical consciousness, which includes the ability to critically analyze conditions in the organizational and broader societal contexts that produce health inequities and act to transform them. Third, it works to strengthen relationships so they can be change vehicles. Fourth, it empowers an implementation team that models a culture of equity. Finally, it aligns equity-focused culture transformation with equity-focused operations transformation to support transformative praxis. These 5 strategies are not a panacea. However, emerging processes and outcomes at the medical center indicate that they may reduce the likelihood of ahistorical and power-blind approaches to equity initiatives and provide employees with some of the critical missing knowledge and skills they need to address the root causes of health inequity.",Todic J

Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2022,7,Considerations for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Clinical Trial Design.,"Thoughtful clinical trial design is critical for efficient therapeutic development, particularly in the field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where trials often aim to detect modest treatment effects among a population with heterogeneous disease progression. Appropriate outcome measure selection is necessary for trials to provide decisive and informative results. Investigators must consider the outcome measure's reliability, responsiveness to detect change when change has actually occurred, clinical relevance, and psychometric performance. ALS clinical trials can also be performed more efficiently by utilizing statistical enrichment techniques. Innovations in ALS prediction models allow for selection of participants with less heterogeneity in disease progression rates without requiring a lead-in period, or participants can be stratified according to predicted progression. Statistical enrichment can reduce the needed sample size and improve study power, but investigators must find a balance between optimizing statistical efficiency and retaining generalizability of study findings to the broader ALS population. Additional progress is still needed for biomarker development and validation to confirm target engagement in ALS treatment trials. Selection of an appropriate biofluid biomarker depends on the treatment mechanism of interest, and biomarker studies should be incorporated into early phase trials. Inclusion of patients with ALS as advisors and advocates can strengthen clinical trial design and study retention, but more engagement efforts are needed to improve diversity and equity in ALS research studies. Another challenge for ALS therapeutic development is identifying ways to respect patient autonomy and improve access to experimental treatment, something that is strongly desired by many patients with ALS and ALS advocacy organizations. Expanded access programs that run concurrently to well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials may provide an opportunity to broaden access to promising therapeutics without compromising scientific integrity or rushing regulatory approval of therapies without adequate proof of efficacy.",Fournier CN
Nursing inquiry,2022,7,Thinking rhizomatically and becoming successful with disabled students in the accommodations assemblage: Using storytelling as method.,"The number of disabled students enrolled in higher education institutions is increasing. Yet in disciplines such as nursing, where placements are an important part of student success, students' lived experiences, though an important and necessary aspect of promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion, has been ignored. In this paper, we respond to such issues by creating and utilizing a novel storytelling method that harnesses the antiessentialist philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Storytelling empowers students to both describe their experiences and inform institutions on how to better serve them, and we use concepts from Deleuze and Guattari to provide a framework for thinking about students and their pathways toward success as multiple. As we show, applying storytelling as a method through this lens offers an expansion of strategies to put students first and, therefore, promote equity at the administrative, research, educational, and practical levels. We describe how thinking rhizomatically opens new avenues of insight, allowing for the creation of institutional assemblages based on a diverse array of students' needs, enabling them to become successful in their own ways.",Epstein I

Racial and ethnic diversity among trial participants is key to understanding intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may affect patient response to cancer treatments. This ASCO and Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) Research Statement presents specific recommendations and strategies for the research community to improve EDI in cancer clinical trials. There are six overarching recommendations: (1) clinical trials are an integral component of high-quality cancer care, and every person with cancer should have the opportunity to participate; (2) trial sponsors and investigators should design and implement trials with a focus on reducing barriers and enhancing EDI, and work with sites to conduct trials in ways that increase participation of under-represented populations; (3) trial sponsors, researchers, and sites should form long-standing partnerships with patients, patient advocacy groups, and community leaders and groups; (4) anyone designing or conducting trials should complete recurring education, training, and evaluation to demonstrate and maintain cross-cultural competencies, mitigation of bias, effective communication, and a commitment to achieving EDI; (5) research stakeholders should invest in programs and policies that increase EDI in trials and in the research workforce; and (6) research stakeholders should collect and publish aggregate data on racial and ethnic diversity of trial participants when reporting results of trials, programs, and interventions to increase EDI. The recommendations are intended to serve as a guide for the research community to improve participation rates among people from racial and ethnic minority populations historically under-represented in cancer clinical trials.

Ear and hearing,2022,7,Community-Based Participatory Research and Human-Centered Design Principles to Advance Hearing Health Equity.,"Inclusive and equitable research is an ethical imperative. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) as well as human-centered design are approaches that center partnership between community members and academic researchers. Together, academic-community research teams iteratively study community priorities, collaboratively develop ethical study designs, and co-create innovations that are accessible and meaningful to the community partners while advancing science. The foundation of the CBPR approach is reliant on its core principles of equity, colearning, shared power in decision-making, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. While the CBPR approach has been used extensively in public health and other areas of healthcare research, the approach is relatively new to audiology, otolaryngology, and hearing health research. The purpose of the present article is to advance an understanding of the CBPR approach, along with principles from human-centered design, in the context of research aimed to advance equity and access in hearing healthcare.",Marrone NL

Kidney international reports,2022,6,Living Well With Kidney Disease and Effective Symptom Management: Consensus Conference Proceedings.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers a high burden of uremic symptoms that may be underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. Unpleasant symptoms, such as CKD-associated pruritus and emotional/psychological distress, often occur within symptom clusters, and treating 1 symptom may potentially alleviate other symptoms in that cluster. The Living Well with Kidney Disease and Effective Symptom Management Consensus Conference convened health experts and leaders of kidney advocacy groups and kidney networks worldwide to discuss the effects of unpleasant symptoms related to CKD on the health and well-being of those affected, and to consider strategies for optimal symptom management. Optimizing symptom management is a cornerstone of conservative and preservative management which aim to prevent or delay dialysis initiation. In persons with kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis (KDRD), incremental transition to dialysis and home dialysis modalities offer personalized approaches. KDRD is proposed as the preferred term given the negative connotations of ""failure"" as a kidney descriptor, and the success stories in CKD journeys. Engaging persons with CKD to identify and prioritize their personal values and individual needs must be central to ensure their active participation in CKD management, including KDRD. Person-centered communication and care are required to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion; education/awareness that considers the health literacy of persons with CKD; and shared decision-making among the person with CKD, care partners, and providers. By putting the needs of people with CKD, including effective symptom management, at the center of their treatment, CKD can be optimally treated in a way that aligns with their goals.",Rhee CM

Kidney international reports,2022,6,Improving Cancer Care for Patients With CKD: The Need for Changes in Clinical Trials.,"Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer generally have narrow therapeutic indices along with potentially serious adverse toxicities. Many cancer drugs are at least partially excreted through the kidney and, thus, the availability of accurate data on safe and effective dosing of these drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential to guide treatment decisions. Typically, during drug development, initial clinical studies only include patients with normal or only mildly impaired kidney function. In subsequent preregistration studies, a limited number of patients with more severe kidney dysfunction are included. Data obtained from patients with either severe kidney dysfunction (here defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 ml/min or stage 4G CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring kidney replacement treatment are particularly limited before drug registration and only a minority of new drug applications to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include data from this population. Unfortunately, limited data and/or other safety concerns may result in a manufacturer statement that the drug is contraindicated in patients with advanced kidney disease, which hinders access to potentially beneficial drugs for these patients. This systemic exclusion of patients with CKD from cancer drug trials remains an unsolved problem, which prevents provision of optimal clinical care for these patients, raises questions of inclusion, diversity, and equity. In addition, with the aging of the population, there are increasing numbers of patients with CKD and cancer who face these issues. In this review, we evaluate the scientific basis to exclude patients with CKD from cancer trials and propose a comprehensive strategy to address this problem.",Sprangers B

Cancer discovery,2022,6,"Enhancing the Trajectories of Cancer Health Disparities Research: Improving Clinical Applications of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.","In order to accurately detect and prevent racial disparities, self-reported race (SRR) and ethnicity remain valuable tools; however, inaccurate capture of patient identity and broad aggregation of minoritized race groups present challenges for data interpretation. Also, although SRR is a proxy for shared social/cultural experience, it is not an accurate representation of shared endogenous factors. Biological investigations into cancer disparities, particularly those involving genetic features, should be framed in the context of genetic background or ancestry, as these are heritable aspects of population health. In reality, both genetics and environment work in concert to influence cancer risk and clinical outcomes. The best opportunity to define actionable means for reducing health disparities is in rigorous and comprehensive generation of rich data sets that characterize environmental, biological, and genetic components of disparate disease burden. To translate this pivotal disparities research into clinical tools and improved policies, we describe a diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) framework, which will increase participation from diverse backgrounds, reexamine previous research with a rigorous evaluation of appropriate SRR groupings, and engage community leaders to ensure that future research addresses the needs of communities at increased risk.

Evaluation and program planning,2022,6,A culturally responsive evaluation framework and its application in environmental education.,"Despite the many challenges inherent in conducting high-quality evaluations in the field of environmental education (EE), there is a growing recognition of the importance of evaluation, not only to gauge program success, but also to use evaluation results to improve programming, support organizational learning, and ensure programs are meeting the needs of diverse audiences. The challenges to conducting high-quality evaluations are exacerbated by historical issues of inequity and systemic racism that are pervasive in the United States and globally. We reviewed the literature on culturally responsive approaches to evaluation to propose a culturally responsive evaluation framework and consider its application in EE. This framework helps EE organizations and evaluators consider how issues of race, power, privilege, and inequity influence the evaluation process and the validity of evaluation findings. Implementing this framework may be resource-intensive, but it has the potential to improve evaluation processes and produce actionable results to further address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of EE. We call for organizations that support EE efforts to recognize the importance of this approach, and provide adequate resources to encourage its implementation.",Anderson KC

Journal of the National Medical Association,2022,6,The removal of race from kidney function estimation: Key points for primary providers.,"Recent recognitions of longstanding societal effects of structural and overt acts of racism have led to calls for the elimination of race, a social construct, from medical algorithms. This accelerated a growing concern with the use of race in kidney function estimating equations. A task force sponsored by the two leading nephrology societies in the United States has reassessed the inclusion of race in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation and recently put forth recommendations. New race-free equations have been developed and guides for widespread implementation have been provided. We herein review the journey of kidney function estimating equations, race in GFR estimating equations, new race-free equations and the path forward in caring for chronic kidney disease. We urge upon all primary care providers to employ concerted focus on early detection and identification of kidney dysfunction as well as risk factors including social determinants of health to prevent progression.",Aklilu A
Journal of Great Lakes research,2022,6,"Early career researchers benefit from inclusive, diverse and international collaborations: Changing how academic institutions utilize the seminar series.","Efforts to make research environments more inclusive and diverse are beneficial for the next generation of Great Lakes researchers. The global COVID-19 pandemic introduced circumstances that forced graduate programs and academic institutions to re-evaluate and promptly pivot research traditions, such as weekly seminar series, which are critical training grounds and networking opportunities for early career researchers (ECRs). While several studies have established that academics with funded grants and robust networks were better able to weather the abrupt changes in research and closures of institutions, ECRs did not. In response, both existing and novel partnerships provided a resilient network to support ECRs at an essential stage of their career development. Considering these challenges, we sought to re-frame the seminar series as a virtual collaboration for ECRs. Two interdisciplinary graduate programs, located in different countries (Windsor, Canada, and Detroit, USA) invested in a year-long partnership to deliver a virtual-only seminar series that intentionally promoted: the co-creation of protocols and co-led roles, the amplification of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion throughout all aspects of organization and representation, engagement and amplification through social media, the integration of social, scientific and cultural research disciplines, all of which collectively showcased the capacity of our ECRs to lead, organize and communicate. This approach has great potential for application across different communities to learn through collaboration and sharing, and to empower the next generation to find new ways of working together.",Febria CM
American journal of pharmaceutical education,2022,6,Engaging in Authentic Allyship as Part of Our Professional Development.,"Educational institutions increasingly recognize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to combat and dismantle structures that sustain inequities. However, successful DEI work hinges on individuals being authentic allies and incorporating allyship into their professional development. Allyship involves members of dominant groups recognizing their privilege and engaging in actions to create inclusivity and equitable spaces for all. Individuals from dominant groups with desires to actively support others from marginalized groups are often unsure how to fight oppression and prejudice. Our goal as faculty with diverse perspectives and heterogeneous intersectional identities is to provide readers with the tools to develop as an authentic ally through educating themselves about the identities and experiences of others, challenging their own discomfort and prejudices, dedicating the time and patience to learning how to be an ally, and taking action to promote change toward personal, institutional, and societal justice and equality. Ultimately, each person must advocate for change because we all hold the responsibility. When everyone is an authentic ally, we all thrive and rise together.",Arif S

Our values set the course for goals and subsequent actions for the year. In our 3 days away from the office to focus on the journal, we have the quiet space to set intentions. Then, we set timelines, we send emails, we put things in motion. We came to this year's retreat prepared to consider a critical topic: equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). That Families, Systems, & Health (FSH) recruit, welcome, review, and publish science that is representative of the widest range of experience and perspective is a core value for us as coeditors. We feel we have a moral and ethical obligation as leaders, scientists, and humans, to pursue social justice and equitable health outcomes for all. Such efforts are needed to help rectify the longstanding history of systemic racism and discrimination against minoritized communities that continues even today. In the context of recent events including protests against racial injustices as well as health disparities experienced by people of color during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the scientific community is realizing we can no longer remain bystanders. Our role as coeditors of a journal affords the opportunity to support equitable and inclusive practices representing a diverse array of individuals and communities throughout the peer review and publication process, which not only enhances equity but also improves science. In exploratory conversations with our leadership team (i.e., coeditors, associate editors, and department editors) and editorial board, we knew that all of us were of a mind in our values and aspirations to improve EDI in FSH. We write this editorial to transparently communicate in a way that provides context for recent and upcoming changes in journal processes designed to support EDI.

The journal of pain,2022,6,Confronting Racism in All Forms of Pain Research: Reframing Study Designs.,"This second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research across the translational spectrum focuses on study design factors. Although objectivity is a cornerstone value of science, subjectivity is embedded in every step of the research process as investigators make choices about who they collaborate with, which research questions they ask, how they recruit participants, which research tools they use, and how they analyze and interpret data. We present theory and evidence from disciplines such as sociology, medical anthropology, statistics, and public health to discuss 4 common study design factors, including 1) the dominant biomedical narrative of pain that restricts funding and exploration of social indicators of pain, 2) low diversity and inclusion in pain research enrollment that restricts generalizability to racialized groups, 3) the use of ""race"" or ""ethnicity"" as a statistical variable and proxy for lived experiences (eg, racism, resilience), and 4) limited modeling in preclinical research for the impact of social factors on pain physiology. The information presented in this article is intended to start conversations across stakeholders in the pain field to explore how we can come together to adopt antiracism practices in our work at large to achieve equity for racialized groups. PERSPECTIVE: This is the second paper in a 3-part series on antiracism in pain research. This part identifies common study design factors that risk hindering progress toward pain care equity. We suggest reframes using an antiracism framework for these factors to encourage all pain investigators to collectively make strides toward equity.",Letzen JE

These requests are not in lieu of current workload and seldom count toward scholarship; the service may go unrecognized, unrewarded, and uncompensated. URiM faculty (underrepresented in medicine) providing such service thus pay a minority tax when precious time is syphoned away from career-advancing activities and personal growth. The resulting strain on available resources has social, psychological, and monetary ramifications that can undermine the long-term objectives of DEI initiatives. We examine the facets of the minority tax, consider the current state of diversity, and present a roadmap to redistribute, reform, and reduce URiM taxation through shared engagement in DEI initiatives. Key interventions include ascribing value to DEI efforts, implementing evidence-based policies to reduce bias, and promoting mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship.",Faucett EA

As a profession, we, along with our colleagues and students, have recognized the need to improve and incorporate diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) within our daily ways of practice to help create access to genomic technologies. In order to create systemic change and focus on unity, open communication, and transparency, we introduce a suggested framework called ERA (Education, Recruitment, Retainment, Research, and Active Outreach). This framework would benefit a genetic counselor throughout various stages of their career, from student to practicing genetic counselor, and can be broadly applied to all specialties of genomic medicine. Different iterations of DEIJ efforts have arisen in the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), from the D&I (Diversity and Inclusion) Task Force to the J.E.D.I (justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion) committee. The lack of recorded history of these previous efforts and the lack of communication between current DEIJ organizations is one of the many reasons the ERA framework demands unity and transparency to achieve sustainable positive change. Genetic counselors must unite and work collaboratively to conduct and promote DEIJ efforts, so the benefits of genomic medicine can be realized by all.",Mercado J

Journal of medical Internet research,2021,2,"Culturally Competent Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation Information Practices and Electronic Health Records: Rapid Review.","Background: Outdated gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) information practices in health care contribute to health inequities for sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. Objective: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. Results: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. Conclusions: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency. Modern GSSO information practices depend on and reinforce SGM competency in health care. JMIR Med Inform 2021;9(2):e25467 doi:10.2196/25467","Davison, Kelly"

Specifically, we explored the joint effects of biological sex and gender diversity in self-identity on the role demands-work and family conflict relationships. To advance the inclusion of scientific knowledge, the present study was conducted in the cultural context of a Chinese society. We surveyed a sample of 317 Taiwanese employees. We used structured questionnaires to collect data on biological sex, gender identity (self-endorsement on masculinity and femininity traits), work and family demands, work-to-family conflict (WFC), and family-to-work conflict (FWC). We found two sets of significant three-way interactions (sex × femininity × role demands) in predicting work and family conflict. First, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the positive relationship between work demands and FWC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Second, for men, identifying with high femininity traits strengthened the relationship between family demands and WFC; for women, identifying with low femininity traits strengthened the same relationship. Our findings highlight the importance of jointly examining the biological, psychological, and social aspects of gender on the work and family interface.

The curriculum includes monthly didactic sessions and two half- day skill-building sessions on EDI fundamentals and responding to microaggressions. Objective: To describe how curriculum implementation changed residents self-perceived knowledge, attitudes and behaviors when delivering patient care to diverse patient populations. Two focus groups (n=13) were conducted by trained facilitators with senior pediatric residents using a structured question guide. Written notes and audio transcripts were recorded. Four project members coded the notes and transcripts using a codebook. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The full project team reviewed and discussed common themes. Of the 13 residents, 61% (8/13) were R2s. 31% (4/13) were residents of color and 77% (10/13) were female. Four major themes were identified (Table 1. First, residents described a sense of importance and empowerment to engage in EDI issues after the curriculum. Second, residents reported gaining specific skills to recognize and address microaggressions. Third, residents described attitude and behavior shifts from increased awareness of biases in patient care. The fourth theme was a limitation in providing equitable care due to availability and appropriate use of interpreters. Pediatric residents reported increased awareness and improved skills when providing care to diverse populations after implementation of an EDI curriculum. Residents described how this curriculum provided language to properly recognize and address witnessed inequities. Next steps in curricular efforts include a follow-up quantitative survey of all residents, focus groups with interns and direct observation of resident behaviors to assess impact.","Gilliam, Courtney A."

Teaching and learning in medicine,2022,5,A Novel Narrative Medicine Approach to DEI Training for Medical School Faculty.,"Problem          :Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) trainings for medical school faculty often lack self-reflective and pedagogically focused components that may promote incorporation of anti-racism and social justice into medical school curricula.             Intervention          : A four-session Narrative Medicine (NM) anti-racism program was designed for medical school faculty using critical race theory, phenomenology, and NM methods. Each workshop consisted of a lecture on key NM concepts and a small-group breakout session incorporating group discussion, close reading, and reflective writing.             Context          : This NM anti-racism program was developed and implemented in April 2021 by two medical students for faculty at an institution in the southeastern U.S. The program was supported by the Office of Inclusive Excellence at the institution and held in collaboration with the institution's medical education teaching academy. Program evaluation consisted of pre- and post-program surveys, which queried participants' previous experiences with DEI and medical humanities programs, perceptions of self-identity and privilege, and confidence in teaching concepts of anti-racism. Of the total program participants (n = 32), 19 completed both surveys (54.3%). Survey data were analyzed using bivariate testing methods and qualitative thematic analysis.             Impact          : Post-program surveys showed 13 (68.4%) participants felt ""somewhat more"" or ""more"" comfortable engaging in concepts of race, and 12 (63.2%) participants felt ""somewhat more"" or ""more"" comfortable including topics of race into their teaching compared to before the program. Five themes were generated following qualitative analysis: (1) the value of longitudinal narrative reflection in a small-group setting for DEI work; (2) desire to commit more time to DEI, anti-racist, and social justice work while balancing busy teaching and clinical schedules; (3) the value of storytelling in DEI and anti-racism programming; (4) an understanding of deconstructive and reconstructive work of anti-racism in medicine; and (5) an increased ability to educate and enact change through teaching, activism, and institutional cultural and policy changes.             Lessons Learned          : This novel NM DEI training for medical school faculty was successful in increasing comfort discussing and teaching concepts of race in the medical school classroom, while providing a uniquely reflective space for personal growth. Participation in this longitudinal reflective experience was limited by physician schedules, therefore efforts to make time to participate in similar longitudinal interventions must be undertaken.",Holdren S
,2022,5,Improving Representation in Clinical Trials and Research: Building Research Equity for Women and Underrepresented Groups,"The United States has long made substantial investments in clinical research with the goal of improving the health and well-being of our nation. There is no doubt that these investments have contributed significantly to treating and preventing disease and extending human life. Nevertheless, clinical research faces a critical shortcoming. Currently, large swaths of the U.S. population, and those that often face the greatest health challenges, are less able to benefit from these discoveries because they are not adequately represented in clinical research studies. While progress has been made with representation of white women in clinical trials and clinical research, there has been little progress in the last three decades to increase participation of racial and ethnic minority population groups. This underrepresentation is compounding health disparities, with serious consequences for underrepresented groups and for the nation.

Ecology letters,2022,5,"An intersectionality lens is needed to establish a global view of equity, diversity and inclusion.","Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) have become essential considerations in different academic fields in recent years, attracting an increasing number of voices and perspectives from different groups. There is a need for an intersectionality framework that is inclusive of both the local and global diversity of researchers. Here, we present an intersectionality framework called KLOB which structures barriers to academic success into four components: knowledge exchange (K), language (L), obligations (O), and biases (B), and thus helps to think about the cumulative effect of multiple barriers that individuals from different backgrounds encounter to succeed in academic activities such as scientific publishing, which is the primary currency of academic success in our current system. This framework highlights both local and global disparities in socioeconomic, linguistic, and discriminatory factors that determine the opportunity of individual researchers to succeed in academia. We emphasise that individual researchers have no control over most barriers they face because of where and how they were born. Implementing solutions to address barriers associated with KLOB requires a multiscale vision and initiatives that tackle local and global inequities.",Khelifa R

These recommendations pertain to away rotations, virtual interviews, Electronic Residency Application Service opening for programs and the overall residency timeline, and general communications and attempt to provide clarity and level the playing field during the 2020-2021 residency application cycle. The WG's aims include promoting professional accountability by improving the quality, efficiency, and continuity of the education, training, and assessment of physicians. The authors argue the first 3 WG recommendations may disproportionately impact candidates from historically excluded and underrepresented groups in medicine (HEURGMs) and may affect an institution's ability to ensure equity in the selection of residency applicants and, thus, warrant further consideration. The authors examine these recommendations from a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) perspective. For each of the first 3 WG recommendations, the authors highlight new opportunities created by the recommendations and detail challenges that programs must carefully navigate to ensure equity for all candidates. The authors also recommend solutions to guide programs as they address these challenges, meet new common program requirements, and attempt to promote equity for HEURGMs. Finally, the authors recommend that after the 2020-2021 recruitment cycle, the medical education community evaluate DEI-related outcomes of both the WG's and the authors' recommendations and incorporate the findings into future application cycles.",Wilson LT

An open-ended survey was electronically administered to members of our institutional GME DEIJ committee. Responses were analyzed using a rapid qualitative analytical approach. Eighteen members (58%) responded. Of these, (67%) were women and five (28%) were Black. Six domains emerged: ""motivation,"" ""challenges,"" ""emotional response,"" ""highs,"" ""facilitators,"" and ""advice."" Black respondents more often cited the need to increase diversity as a motivator to join this work. Women and Black respondents more often identified time constraints as a challenge to participation.

The health inequities laid bare by the COVID-19 syndemic (a concept that describes the clustering of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease by political, social, and economic factors) compels health professions educators to learn how to best engage in, sustain, and deepen conversations on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within our learning environments. Health professions curricula should address such concerns through explicit faculty training programs in dialogue models of communication. In this commentary, I propose that medical improv can help refocus health professions training to the humanistic values of empathy for others and respect for multiple viewpoints. Medical improv refers to teaching methods that adapt improvisation principles and exercises to enhance professional competencies in the health professions, such as communication. I describe a training series implemented at one institution to prepare faculty facilitators to engage in conversations about DEI in a discussion-based core course on the social determinants of health for first year medical students called ""Humanity in Medicine."" Key elements of dialogue training, including examinations of identity and positionality, caretaking and team-making, and conversations with a skeptic, are viewed through the lens of improv exercises as a pedagogy in communication.

This commentary is the first public report from the Task Force. We focus on African Americans with some comments on Jews and women, noting that all marginalized groups deserve study. Through much of its 130 year history, some members were an essential part of perpetuating racist ideas, the Association largely ignored racism and had some practices that prevented participation. The Task Force concluded that individual and structural racism within the AAA, combined with the broader social context in which the Association developed, contributed to the current underrepresentation of African Americans who constitute 4.1% of the membership even though 13.4% of the U.S. population is Black. Intentional efforts within the AAA to reckon with racism and other forms of bias have only begun in the last 10-20 years. These actions have led to more diverse leadership within the Association, and it is hoped that these changes will positively affect the recruitment and retention of marginalized people to science in general and anatomy in particular.

Frontiers in sports and active living,2022,3,Listening to Athletes' Voices: National Team Athletes' Perspectives on Advancing Safe Sport in Canada.,"With increased media scrutiny, public awareness, and research on the prevalence of maltreatment experiences in sport, sport organizations have faced increased pressures to combat unsafe practices in sport. A consequence has been the emergence of the Safe Sport movement whereby organizations including the International Olympic Committee, Safe Sport International, US Center for SafeSport, Sport Canada, and others, have developed policies, initiatives, and education intended to create safer sport environments for all participants. Most of these policies have been implemented using a top-down approach, driven by government officials and sport leaders. However, if safe sport initiatives are to benefit athletes, consideration and incorporation of athletes' perspectives in the development and implementation of initiatives are imperative. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine athletes' perspectives on the challenges and recommendations to advancing safe sport. As part of a large-scale survey of current and retired Canadian National Team Athletes' experiences of maltreatment, open-ended questions were asked about athletes' recommendations and considerations for safe sport. Responses to these questions ( n = 386) were analyzed using thematic analysis. According to the participants, barriers and challenges to safe sport included emphasizing performance excellence at-all-costs, normalization and complicity of harm, lack of attention to equity, diversity and inclusion, a culture of fear and silence, and a lack of trust in organizations to handle cases of harm. In an effort to advance safe sport, participants recommended prioritizing holistic athlete development, improving and strengthening accountability measures, implementing an independent 3rd party for disclosure, reporting and support, increased attention to equity, diversity and inclusion, stakeholder education, prohibition of sexual relations between athletes and those in positions of power and authority, and adoption of a broader perspective of harms and perpetrators.

The goal of the pre-conference workshop was to help develop a shared understanding of the importance of several tobacco-related priority groups in tobacco use disorder (TUD) treatment research and to highlight challenges in measurement related to these groups. The workshop focused on persons with minoritized sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation identities; persons with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds; persons with lower socioeconomic status (SES); and persons with mental health concerns. In addition to experiencing commercial tobacco-related health disparities, these groups are also underrepresented in tobacco research, including TUD treatment studies. Importantly, there is wide variation in how and whether researchers are identifying variation within these priority groups. Best practices for measuring and reporting sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, SES, and mental health concerns in TUD treatment research are needed. This paper provides information about measurement challenges when including these groups in TUD treatment research and specific recommendations about how to measure these groups and assess potential disparities in outcomes. The goal of this paper is to encourage TUD treatment researchers to use measurement best practices in these priority groups in an effort to conduct meaningful and equity-promoting research. Increasing the inclusion and visibility of these groups in TUD treatment research will help to move the field forward in decreasing tobacco-related health disparities. Implications: Tobacco-related disparities exist for a number of priority groups including, among others, women, individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities, individuals with minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds, individuals with lower SES, and individuals with mental health concerns. Research on TUD treatments for many of these subgroups is lacking.

The present authors call ourselves the ICBOs and Allies Workgroup (ICBOs stands for independent community-based organizations), and we represent communities historically excluded from the sciences. Together with institutional allies and advisors, we began our research because we wanted our voices to be heard, and we hoped to bring a different perspective to doing science with and not on communities. We created a community framework to guide our research and we led all aspects of our work, from creating research protocols to analyzing and interpreting the data to disseminating the results. We share our research framework, methods, and results so that science institutions can better understand how to intentionally create more equitable research partnerships with our communities.",
AAS open research,2022,3,Competency-based Training Needs Assessment for Research Managers and Administrators in Africa and the United Kingdom to Strengthen Equitable Partnerships.,"Background: The need for competent research managers and administrators (RMAs) has increased due to the complexity in managing research projects between disparate and international partners. To facilitate the creation of robust training and professional development programmes it is essential to first understand the status quo. A collaborative project, Sustainable Management and Administration for Research: Training across the project Lifecycle (SMARTLife), made up of RMAs from South Africa, Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom (UK) developed a set of competencies to conduct an RMA competency-based training needs assessment scoping tool. Method: Nine areas were identified: Equitable partnership; Finance Management; Project Management; Monitoring and Evaluation; Reporting and Communications; Equity, Diversity & Inclusion; Training and Capacity Development; Impact a& Sustainability; and Ethical, Social, Legal a& Social Implications.  Tasks for each competency area were identified to develop an scoping tool that had 168 data collection points. The tool was advertised through press releases, mailing lists and social media. Results:  108 responses were obtained:  with 49% from 15 Africa countries/the remainder from the UK. The UK (71%) had more permanent RMA staff members compared to Africa (39%). There were more respondents in Africa with the title of Research Manager/Coordinator(p=0.0132) compared to the UK where most of the RMAs were employed as Finance/Contract officers. 60% of respondents from the UK had more than three years experience while only 35% from Africa had experience. While most RMAs had formal higher education qualifications, their training was not in research management and administration, which requires a diverse range of skills. Confidence in specific tasks varied between the UK and Africa whereas collaborative partnerships challenges and enablers were similar. Conclusion This work highlights differences in RMA training and experience RMA  between Africa and UK, this work could inform much needed competency-based training for RMAs and partnership strategies that aid mutual-learning.",Nembaware V

Frontiers in psychology,2022,3,"'Safe Sport Is Not for Everyone': Equity-Deserving Athletes' Perspectives of, Experiences and Recommendations for Safe Sport.","There is a growing concern that the voices of athletes, and in particular, athletes from equity-deserving groups, are unaccounted for in the development and advancement of Safe Sport initiatives. The lack of consideration of the needs and experiences of diverse groups is concerning, given the existing literature outside the context of sport indicating that equity-deserving individuals experience more violence. As such, the following study sought to understand how equity-deserving athletes interpret and experience Safe Sport. Grounded within an interpretive phenomenological analysis, semi-structured interviews were used to understand how athletes with marginalised identities conceptualise and experience Safe Sport. Seven participants, including two Black male athletes, two White, gay male athletes, one Middle Eastern female athlete, one White, female athlete with a physical disability and one White, non-binary, queer, athlete with a physical disability, were asked to conceptualise and describe their experiences of Safe Sport. The findings revealed these athletes perceived Safe Sport as an unrealistic and unattainable ideal that cannot fully be experienced by those from equity-deserving groups. This interpretation was reinforced by reported experiences of discriminatory comments, discriminatory behaviours and systemic barriers, perpetrated by coaches, teammates, and resulting from structural aspects of sport. The findings draw on the human rights literature to suggest integrating principles of equity, diversity and inclusion are fundamental to safeguarding equity-deserving athletes.",Gurgis JJ

A Descriptive Study of Remote Undergraduate Research Programs during COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic shut down undergraduate research programs across the United States. A group of 23 colleges, universities, and research institutes hosted remote undergraduate research programs in the life sciences during Summer 2020. Given the unprecedented offering of remote programs, we carried out a study to describe and evaluate them. Using structured templates, we documented how programs were designed and implemented, including who participated. Through focus groups and surveys, we identified programmatic strengths and shortcomings as well as recommendations for improvements from students' perspectives. Strengths included the quality of mentorship, opportunities for learning and professional development, and a feeling of connection with a larger community. Weaknesses included limited cohort building, challenges with insufficient structure, and issues with technology. Although all programs had one or more activities related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, these topics were largely absent from student reports even though programs coincided with a peak in national consciousness about racial inequities and structural racism. Our results provide evidence for designing remote Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) that are experienced favorably by students. Our results also indicate that remote REUs are sufficiently positive to further investigate their affordances and constraints, including the potential to scale up offerings, with minimal concern about disenfranchising students.",Erickson OA

In June 2020, the AUGS President, Dr Shawn Menefee, and Board of Directors called for a Presidential Task Force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to study the current state of our society and make recommendations for future directions. The charge was intentionally broad. In review of the literature, there was little to inform the best means to proceed aside from administering climate surveys to gauge the current culture of inclusion and bias. The task force believed that the challenge was not only to describe the problem but also to articulate solutions. We ultimately moved to rewrite the Diversity and Inclusion and Code of Conduct Statements and develop an Action Plan that would accelerate the efforts of AUGS to foster inclusion and improve equity through the existing governance structure.

BMJ open respiratory research,2022,3,Implementation of prognostic machine learning algorithms in paediatric chronic respiratory conditions: a scoping review.,"Machine learning (ML) holds great potential for predicting clinical outcomes in heterogeneous chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) affecting children, where timely individualised treatments offer opportunities for health optimisation. This paper identifies rate-limiting steps in ML prediction model development that impair clinical translation and discusses regulatory, clinical and ethical considerations for ML implementation. A scoping review of ML prediction models in paediatric CRDs was undertaken using the PRISMA extension scoping review guidelines. From 1209 results, 25 articles published between 2013 and 2021 were evaluated for features of a good clinical prediction model using the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines.Most of the studies were in asthma (80%), with few in cystic fibrosis (12%), bronchiolitis (4%) and childhood wheeze (4%). There were inconsistencies in model reporting and studies were limited by a lack of validation, and absence of equations or code for replication. Clinician involvement during ML model development is essential and diversity, equity and inclusion should be assessed at each step of the ML pipeline to ensure algorithms do not promote or amplify health disparities among marginalised groups. As ML prediction studies become more frequent, it is important that models are rigorously developed using published guidelines and take account of regulatory frameworks which depend on model complexity, patient safety, accountability and liability.",Filipow N

As researchers focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, we contend that STEM education must, as a discipline, grapple with how analytic approaches may not fully support equity efforts. We discuss how researchers and educational practitioners should more critically approach STEM equity analyses and why modifying our approaches matters for STEM equity goals. Engaging with equity as a process rather than a static goal, we provide a primer of reflective questions to assist researchers with framing, analysis, and interpretation of student-level data frequently used to identify disparities and assess course-level and programmatic interventions. This guidance can inform analyses conducted by campus units such as departments and programs, but also across universities and the scientific community to enhance how we understand and address systemic inequity in STEM fields.",Pearson MI

At the same time, there is a clear need to enhance didactic curricular content and clinical training experiences that explicitly address the full scope of medical needs that individuals with disabilities have. These gaps represent missed opportunities to advance the health of an important, underserved, and growing population. Based on the authors' experience, the inclusion of people with physical or sensory disabilities in medical education greatly enhances the education of all learners and the professional development of faculty and staff, providing invaluable perspectives on the significant abilities of individuals with diverse physical or sensory disabilities. There are additional efforts and costs associated with the education of a medical student who is blind, is deaf, uses a wheelchair, or has another disability. But based on the authors' experience, it is clear that the societal return on investment is enormous, and the costs associated with a failure to embrace full inclusivity are much greater.

We evaluated the trends and gender differences in the guideline writing groups of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines from 2006 to 2020. Methods and Results We extracted all guidelines authors from 2006 to 2020, assessed their gender from publicly available profiles, and compared differences based on subspecialties and specific societies. Stratified and trend analyses were performed using χ 2 and average annual percentage change/average 5 year percentage change. A total of 80 ACC/AHA (1288 authors [28% women]), 64 CCS (988 authors [26% women]), and 59 ESC (1157 authors [16% women]) guidelines were analyzed. A significant increase in inclusion of women was seen in ACC/AHA (12.6% [2006] to 42.6% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [2.3% to 11.1%]; P =0.005) and ESC (7.1% [2006] to 25.8% [2020]; average annual percentage change, 6.6% [0.2% to 13.5%]; P =0.04), but the trend remained similar in CCS (20.6% [2006] to 36.3% [2020]; average annual percentage change, -0.1% (-3.7% to 3.5%); P =0.94), guideline authors. More women were coauthors in the ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines when women were chairs of guidelines. There was a persistent disparity of women among guideline authors for general cardiology and all subspecialties, except for pediatric cardiology and heart failure guidelines. The appointment of women authors as a chair was significantly low in all societies (22.4% [ACC/AHA], 16.9% [CCS], and 7.2% [ESC]; P =0.008). Conclusions There is a significant disparity in the inclusion of women on all national guideline committees, in addition to serving as a chair of cardiology guidelines.

Methods: A survey was created with the input of both task force members as well as MLA professional staff. It was administered via SurveyMonkey and distributed through email over the course of two weeks in October 2019. Results: The demographics portion of the survey--beyond asking the usual questions about race or ethnicity (72% white), age (65% between 30 and 59), and so on--also asked questions that were more specific to diversity including, but not limited to, gender representation (79% female), sexuality (67% heterosexual), military service (97% have never served), ability (26% have anxiety sometimes or in certain situations), and college financial aid (49% used federal student loans). Diversity-specific questions asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the association: 59% strongly agreed or agreed that MLA has a strong commitment to DEI; 54% felt that the amount of time that association was spending on DEI issues was just about right; and 56% were very satisfied or satisfied with the DEI environment at MLA. Members also reported feeling like they belonged in MLA (59%), they were treated with respect (77%), and they were valued by MLA (59%) Conclusion: The survey paints a picture of the membership that is much deeper than any previously conducted membership survey. It shows the diversity of membership, especially in terms of ability and religion. Generally, the membership feels that MLA is right on target with the level of focus that MLA is giving issues of diversity. This survey reinforces the diversity work that has been done and supports diversity work in MLA in the future.","Pionke, J. J."

We describe this process, focusing on factors of diversity, equity, and inclusion including enabling student participation in remote research activities. We collected data about students' learning experiences since the program's inception; therefore, we could evaluate the impact of remote vs. in-person formats. We examined data from five cohorts: three in-person (2017-2019; n = 57) and two remote (2020-2021; n = 45). While there was some concern about the value of participating in a remote format, overall students in both formats viewed the program favorably, with students in the remote cohorts rating some aspects of the program significantly more favorably. In addition, more students who identified as Black or African American participated in the remote format than in the in-person format. We describe lessons learned from this unprecedented challenge and future program directions.",Eakin BL

Methodology The pediatric faculty self-reported data by the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed. The races were classified as White (non-Hispanic), Asian, Hispanic, Black (non-Hispanic), Multiple races (including both non-Hispanic and Hispanic), Others, and Unknown. Gender was categorized as male and female. Results The results showed that Asian, Black (non-Hispanic), and Hispanic academic pediatricians increased in full professor, associate professor, and assistant professor positions and decreased in instructor positions from 2007 to 2020. Black (non-Hispanic) academic pediatricians relatively decreased 5.5% in chairperson positions. Women increased in full professor, associate professor, instructor, and chairperson positions; however, relatively decreased 1.8% in assistant professor positions. Men and White (non-Hispanic) academic pediatricians relatively decreased 10.5% and 16%, respectively, in all academic ranks. Women, Asian, Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, and Other races were underrepresented in tenured, on-track (tenure-eligible), and not-on-track (tenure-eligible) positions.

Journal of community health,2022,2,The Most Important Skills Required by Local Public Health Departments for Responding to Community Needs and Improving Health Outcomes.,"In 2017, Public Health 3.0 was introduced, providing recommendations that expand traditional public department functions and programs. Operationalizing the framework requires that local health departments invest in the requisite professional skills to respond to their community's needs. The purpose of this paper is to determine the professional skills that are most important for local health departments to respond to large public health issues and challenges that are having a major impact on their communities. The study used a cross-sectional assessment of the education and training needs of local public health departments in Nebraska following the principles of practice-based systems research. The assessment was designed to assess the training and education needs of local health department staff members. The questions measured the perceived importance of and respondent's capacity across 57 core competencies for public health professionals modified from the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice. A total of 104 staff members from seven local health departments were requested to complete the assessment and 100% of the individuals responded to and completed the assessment. Twenty-eight skills were identified as the most important skills needed for local health departments. The skills were themed and categorized into four domains. (1) Data, Evaluation, and Quality Improvement, (2) Community Engagement and Facilitation, (3) Systems Thinking and Leadership, and (4) Policy and Advocacy. The results from this analysis provide direction to strengthen and transform the public health system into one that is connected, responsive, and nimble. Additionally, it also highlighted a glaring omission that Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion should be included as the fifth domain.",Grimm B
Studies in history and philosophy of science,2022,2,Still no pill for men? Double standards & demarcating values in biomedical research.,"Double standards are widespread throughout biomedicine, especially in research on reproductive health. One of the clearest cases of double standards involves the feminine gendering of reproductive responsibility for contraception and the continued lack of highly effective, reversible methods for cisgender men. While the biomedical establishment accepts diversity and inclusion as important social values for clinical trials, their continued use of inequitable standards undermines their ability to challenge unfair social hierarchies by developing male contraception. Thus, the gender/sex bias present in contraceptive research raises the ""New Demarcation Problem"": If we accept that values can and will play important roles in science, how can we nevertheless distinguish positive influences of values from more corrosive bias? I argue that biomedical researchers ought to aim their clinical trials at equity and utilize methodologies that actually achieve that aim. More specifically, I contend that we can avoid the problem of double standards by gender/sex in contraceptive research by utilizing more equitable standards. My demarcation strategy captures dynamic interplay between values and their effects, with direct policy implications for institutions conducting, funding, and evaluating clinical trials. For male contraceptive trials, this involves shifting risk assessment from an individual model to a shared model for sexual partners.",ChoGlueck C

Translational oncology,2022,2,NCI's publication affiliation conundrum: Reframing innovation to incentivize an equitable path for advocate representation.,"Advocacy engagement has been at the forefront of National Cancer Institute (NCI) efforts to advance scientific discoveries and transform medical interventions. Nonetheless, the journey for advocates has been uneven. Case in Point: NCI publication affiliation rules of engagement pose unique equity challenges while raising questions about structural representation in biomedical research. Abiding by the core rationale that publication affiliation should be tailored to employment status, the NCI has systematically denied research advocate volunteers the opportunity to specifically list NCI as an institutional affiliation on academic publications. Unpacking advocate NCI publication affiliation restrictions and its links with advocacy heritage preservation and convergent science goals poses unique diversity, equity, and inclusion challenges and opportunities. Improving the quality of structural representation in biomedical research requires new theories of action and flexible planning to advance, promote and build capacity for strategic advocacy inclusion and equity within publication affiliation initiatives. Here we highlight several opportunities for how leadership might formulate a radically different vision for NCI's approach. This perspective interrogates the best way forward for ensuring that biomedical employee and volunteer advocate workforce publication affiliation intersections are characterized by increased creativity and representation parity. Imbuing the scientist and clinical researcher archetype with social dimensions, we join NCI critical thinkers in urging employees, funded academics, and volunteer citizen scientists to collectively assume the role as paladins of science and integrity who view the triumphs of making a difference in science alongside the social responsibility of promoting transdisciplinary professionalism and the democratization of science.",Samson S

A Qualitative Study of Black Women Academic Nurse Leaders in the United States.,"Severe under-representation of Black women academic nurse leaders persists in United States higher education, and a major research gap still exists regarding experiences of these leaders, and facilitators of and barriers to their success. Our objective was to examine how race and gender influence how Black women academic nurse leaders' function in their leadership positions, how they are perceived by their peers, and how their perception of race, gender, class, and power influences diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in the workplace. Critical race theory was used as a guiding theory, and the study design involved narrative inquiry followed by thematic analysis. Four overarching themes with four sub-themes were revealed: (a) Paying a personal price for authenticity, (b) Being the only one is hard even when you are in charge, (c) The illusion of diversity and inclusion while trying to survive, and (d) Focusing on building and sustaining diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,2022,1,Women in radiation (WiR)-a perspective for the strengthening of radiation protection.,"Gender balance refers to the equitable treatment and access to opportunities for all genders. In order to achieve true gender balance, a variety of proactive approaches developed collaboratively, with insight from multiple perspectives, need to be implemented. With that purpose, the participation of women in professions related to radiation and radiation protection was prioritised and given high visibility by allocating a 'Women in Radiation' (WiR) Special Session at the 15th International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA), hosted by South Korea on 20 January 2021. In this session, various issues related to gender balance and equity/equality were highlighted by the panellists, and further elaborated in a subsequent discussion with attendees. The main goal of the WiR Special Session was to convene women from different organisations, career and age stages, disciplines and countries, in particular to consider the Asian-Oceanic vision and status of gender equality, along with other topics to support a 'Call for Action', with concrete recommendations subsequently provided to IRPA. The discussion stressed the main needs and challenges faced by women working in various radiation fields, along with raising awareness of possible professional and employment opportunities. This paper identifies some steps necessary to encourage, enhance and support the inclusion of more diversity in nuclear professions with specific emphasis on women. In conclusion, gender balance and equality must be at the heart of any strategic plan for the future of the radiological protection profession; international cooperation between relevant bodies is essential for success and could serve as a catalyst for specific policy statements aimed at achieving a balanced representation of women in radiological protection.",Voigt G
Biology open,2022,1,The matrix in focus: new directions in extracellular matrix research from the 2021 ASMB hybrid meeting.,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of macromolecules that provides both architectural support and molecular signals to cells and modulate their behaviors. Originally considered a passive mechanical structure, decades of research have since demonstrated how the ECM dynamically regulates a diverse set of cellular processes in development, homeostasis, and disease progression. In September 2021, the American Society for Matrix Biology (ASMB) organized a hybrid scientific meeting, integrating in-person and virtual formats, to discuss the latest developments in ECM research. Here, we highlight exciting scientific advances that emerged from the meeting including (1) the use of model systems for fundamental and translation ECM research, (2) ECM-targeting approaches as therapeutic modalities, (3) cell-ECM interactions, and (4) the ECM as a critical component of tissue engineering strategies. In addition, we discuss how the ASMB incorporated mentoring, career development, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in both virtual and in-person events. Finally, we reflect on the hybrid scientific conference format and how it will help the ASMB accomplish its mission moving forward.",Nerger BA

Socio-ecological practice research,2022,1,Advancing the scholarship and practice of stakeholder engagement in working landscapes: a co-produced research agenda.,"Participatory approaches to science and decision making, including stakeholder engagement, are increasingly common for managing complex socio-ecological challenges in working landscapes. However, critical questions about stakeholder engagement in this space remain. These include normative, political, and ethical questions concerning who participates, who benefits and loses, what good can be accomplished, and for what, whom, and by who. First, opportunities for addressing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion interests through engagement, while implied in key conceptual frameworks, remain underexplored in scholarly work and collaborative practice alike. A second line of inquiry relates to research-practice gaps. While both the practice of doing engagement work and scholarly research on the efficacy of engagement is on the rise, there is little concerted interplay among 'on-the-ground' practitioners and scholarly researchers. This means scientific research often misses or ignores insight grounded in practical and experiential knowledge, while practitioners are disconnected from potentially useful scientific research on stakeholder engagement. A third set of questions concerns gaps in empirical understanding of the efficacy of engagement processes and includes inquiry into how different engagement contexts and process features affect a range of behavioral, cognitive, and decision-making outcomes. Because of these gaps, a cohesive and actionable research agenda for stakeholder engagement research and practice in working landscapes remains elusive. In this review article, we present a co-produced research agenda for stakeholder engagement in working landscapes. The co-production process involved professionally facilitated and iterative dialogue among a diverse and international group of over 160 scholars and practitioners through a yearlong virtual workshop series. The resulting research agenda is organized under six cross-cutting themes: (1) Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion; (2) Ethics; (3) Research and Practice; (4) Context; (5) Process; and (6) Outcomes and Measurement. This research agenda identifies critical research needs and opportunities relevant for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. We argue that addressing these research opportunities is necessary to advance knowledge and practice of stakeholder engagement and to support more just and effective engagement processes in working landscapes.",Eaton WM

Humanities & social sciences communications,2022,1,"Race- and gender-based under-representation of creative contributors: art, fashion, film, and music.","Motivated by the well-established benefits to society of artistic creation and of demographic diversity, we investigate the gender and racial/ethnic composition of influential contributors to four creative domains. Women make up 51% of the U.S. population but are underrepresented at influential levels of contemporary art (28%), high fashion (45%), box office film (27%), and popular music (17%). Marginalized racial/ethnic groups make up 39% of the U.S. population yet comprise approximately half that figure in contemporary art (22%), high fashion (22%), and box office film (19%). Black musical artists have higher representation (48%), though higher representation does not equate with equity and inclusion. As for intersecting identities, white men are overrepresented in all four domains by factors ranging from 1.4 to 2 as compared to the U.S. population, and most other gender-racial/ethnic groups are further minoritized. Our study is the first comprehensive, comparative, empirical look at intersecting identities across creative fields. The exclusion of marginalized individuals, including those who are women, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Latinx, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, is severe. The lack of self-expressed demographic data is a challenge, as is the erasure of certain identity groups from the American Community Survey, including agender, gender noncomforming, nonbinary, and transgender individuals. These are challenges that, if addressed, would enhance our collective understanding of diversity in creative fields.",Topaz CM
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2022,1,"Using Accreditation to Transform Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Efforts Into Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Systems.","The Liaison Committee on Medical Education accreditation process is an important component of professional regulation and is used by medical schools to strengthen their medical education programs. Accreditation-related consultations with schools often include a review of relevant documents, stakeholder interviews, and mock site visits. A review by the author of this commentary of these consultations at 17 schools showed variability in how information regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was incorporated and discussed in accreditation-related materials and interviews. At all schools, DEI information emerged in materials related to the accreditation standards that specifically inquire into DEI. However, at some schools, DEI emerged more broadly across a variety of standards. These differences suggest that considering the totality of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education standards and elements may be a useful tool for enabling schools to analyze and describe their DEI efforts, consider additional ways to engage in continuous quality improvement related to DEI, and achieve institutional DEI goals. In addition, a small number of the reviewed schools appeared to have had particular success in meeting institutional DEI goals. An appreciative inquiry-informed review suggested that these exemplar schools had both area-specific and cross-functional systems focused on achieving DEI goals. In addition, senior leadership demonstrated a commitment to DEI, DEI champions were empowered, and leaders displayed legislative-style and systems leadership skills. Schools that nurture these characteristics may be better positioned to advance DEI. Scholarly evaluation of these observations is necessary.",Nora LM

Further, he insists that oath recitation in medical schools is immoral. I respond to Veatch's criticisms and argue that, with alterations to their content and practice, oaths can have value for articulating moral commitments and building a sense of moral community within the profession. I break down Veatch's multitude of objections to oaths over his career, and I suggest how medical schools can avoid the pitfalls identified by Veatch. A promising and innovative path forward is to integrate a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion-though with an understanding that a few lines in an oath are far from sufficient for institutional culture, faculty accountability, or students' education.",Guidry-Grimes L

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2022,1,Understanding Ethical Challenges in Medical Education Research.,"Rapidly advancing biomedical and electronic technologies, ongoing health disparities, and new online educational modalities are all changing medicine and medical education. As medical training continues to evolve, research is increasingly critical to help improve it, but medical education research can pose unique ethical challenges. As research participants, medical trainees may face several risks and in many ways constitute a vulnerable group. In this commentary, the author examines several of the ethical challenges involved in medical education research, including confidentiality and the risk of stigma; the need for equity, diversity, and inclusion; genetic testing of students; clustered randomized trials of training programs; and questions about quality improvement activities. The author offers guidance for navigating these ethical challenges, including the importance of engaging with institutional review boards. Academic medical institutions should educate and work closely with faculty to ensure that all research adheres to appropriate ethical guidelines and regulations and should provide instruction about the ethics of medical education research to establish a strong foundation for the future of the field. Research on medical education will become increasingly important. Given the potential sensitivity of the data collected in such research, investigators must understand and address potential ethical challenges as carefully as possible.",Klitzman RL
International journal of anthropology and ethnology,2022,1,Beyond multiculturalism: revisioning a model of pandemic anti-racism education in post-Covid-19 Canada.,"Canada was the first country in the world to establish multiculturalism as its official policy for the governance of diversity. Canadian multiculturalism has gained much popularity in political and public discourses in the past 50 years, and it has also received no less criticism as to its effectiveness in addressing issues of racism. There have also been ambiguities over the meaning and intention of multiculturalism, leading to divergent understandings of multiculturalism as an ideal of inclusion and equity, on the one hand, and a mere political rhetoric, on the other. On the occasion of celebrating the 50 th anniversary of Canada's official multiculturalism policy, this article re-visits Canada's multiculturalism by reviewing its history and ethos and critically examining its actual effects as manifested during the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada. The rise of anti-Asian racism, anti-Black racism, and anti-Indigenous racism incidents in the pandemic reveals that multiculturalism has in effect, sustained a racist and unequal society of Canada with racism entrenched in its history and ingrained in every aspect of its social structure. Multiculturalism tolerates cultural difference but does not challenge an unjust society premised on white supremacy. The anti-racism movement mobilized by racialized communities in Canada indicates that multiculturalism has failed to respond to racialized communities' pressing demand for social change and action for social justice. The article concludes with a proposed alternative framework to multiculturalism, that is, pandemic anti-racism education model, to centre the issue of race and racism in an action-oriented, inclusive, and empowering approach toward a future of a just society.",Lei L
American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2022,1,More than grit: growing and sustaining physician-scientists in obstetrics and gynecology.,"Obstetricians know the statistics-1 out of every 10 babies is born premature; preeclampsia affects 1 in 25 pregnant people; the United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world. Yet, physicians and scientists still do not fully understand the biology of normal pregnancy, let alone what causes these complications. Obstetrics and gynecology-trained physician-scientists are uniquely positioned to fill critical knowledge gaps by addressing clinically-relevant problems through fundamental research and interpreting insights from basic and translational studies in the clinical context. Within our specialty, however, physician-scientists are relatively uncommon. Inadequate guidance, lack of support and community, and structural barriers deter fellows and early stage faculty from pursuing the physician-scientist track. One approach to help cultivate the next generation of physician-scientists in obstetrics and gynecology is to demystify the process and address the common barriers that contribute to the attrition of early stage investigators. Here, we review major challenges and propose potential pathways forward in the areas of mentorship, obtaining protected research time and resources, and ensuring diversity, equity, and inclusion, from our perspective as early stage investigators in maternal-fetal medicine. We discuss the roles of early stage investigators and leaders at the institutional and national level in the collective effort to retain and grow our physician-scientist workforce. We aim to provide a framework for early stage investigators initiating their research careers and a starting point for discussion with academic stakeholders. We cannot afford to lose the valuable contributions of talented individuals due to modifiable factors or forfeit our voices as advocates for the issues that impact pregnant populations.",Parchem JG

The primary goals of these efforts are to prevent or mitigate the onset of clinical psychosis, while also treating comorbid issues. It is important to consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in CHR-P work, especially as these programs continue to proliferate around the world. Further, there is a long history in psychiatry of misdiagnosing and mistreating psychosis in individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Although there have been significant developments in early intervention psychosis work, there is evidence that marginalized groups are underserved by current CHR-P screening and intervention efforts. These issues are compounded by the contexts of continued social marginalization and significant mental health disparities in general child/adolescent services. Within this narrative review and call to action, we use an intersectional and minority stress lens to review and discuss current issues related to equity in CHR-P services, offer evidence-based recommendations, and propose next steps. In particular, our intersectional and minority stress lenses incorporate perspectives for a range of marginalized and underserved identities related to race, ethnicity, and culture; faith; immigration status; geography/residence; gender identity; sexual orientation; socioeconomic status/class; and ability status.",DeLuca JS

In 2016, Black students earned 9% of science and 4% of engineering bachelor's degrees compared to a total of 56% of science and engineering bachelor's degrees earned by White students. Even with similar entering rates, Black students leave STEM majors at 1.4 times the rate of White students. These data reflect the manifestation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) barriers faced by Black students and scientists to successfully navigate higher education and pursue careers in STEM fields. There remains a critical need to develop better ways to recruit, retain, train, and graduate Black students in STEM, especially within predominantly White institutions. Biomechanics is a growing interdisciplinary and translational STEM field where DEI barriers persist. Thus, the Black Biomechanists Association (BBA) was founded in 2020 with intentions to reduce these barriers and give much needed support to Black students and biomechanists in STEM spaces. The organization's mission is to uplift and enrich Black biomechanists in their academic and professional careers. Our objectives to achieve this mission provide a supportive environment and resources to address the challenges, needs, and interests of Black biomechanists, as well as aid in the biomechanics community's efforts to achieve DEI. In two short years, BBA has developed a needs-based mentoring program, hosted professional development and culturally-competent mentoring workshops, and produced communications to educate the biomechanics community and broader audience on culturally-relevant topics that impact Black biomechanists.

On one hand, social forces have demonstrated how universities have been institutions for the production and reproduction of systemic inequality. On the other hand, universities maintain that they are well positioned, as part of their institutional renewal practices, to address contemporary calls for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Since universities are now eager to embrace EDI principles, it is appropriate to demonstrate their historical failures and provide some recommendations towards institutional renewal. Drawing on critical pedagogy, the paper examines selected academic contributions and knowledge claims that have reproduced systemic inequality, specifically on the discourse on human classification. The broader question is whether universities are simply going through the motions and hope EDI is a fad or are serious about institutional renewal and transformative changes.

In the following review, we objectively address the data available in terms of training slots for women in general and vascular surgery and within the vascular surgery workforce. Overall, women comprise 36% of active physicians in the 2019 Association of American Medical Colleges data. The number of women in surgical fields is lower representing 22% in general surgery, 9% in neurosurgery, 6% in orthopedic surgery, 17% in plastic surgery, 8% in thoracic surgery, and 15% in vascular surgery. Also notable is the lower academic ranks held by women in surgery. The proportion of women instructors in surgery in 2020 was 61%, assistant professors 30%, associate professors 23%, and full-time professors only 13.5%. There are multiple opportunities across the divisional/institutional/societal domains in which mentorship and sponsorship can promote gender equity and inclusion.

Biomedical engineering education,2022,1,Looking Back on Graduate BME Admissions Data: Lessons Learned and Implications for Holistic Review and Diversity.,"Graduate school applications in Biomedical Engineering (BME) are steadily rising, making competition stiffer, applications more complex, and reviews more resource intensive. Holistic reviews are being increasingly adopted to support increased diversity, equity, and inclusion in graduate student BME admissions, but which application metrics are the strongest predictors of admission and enrollment into BME programs remains unclear. In this perspectives article, we aim to shed light on some of the key predictors of student acceptance in graduate school. We share data from a three-year retrospective review of our own institution's graduate BME applications and admission rates and review the influence of grade point averages (GPA), standardized test scores (e.g., GRE), and prior research experience on graduate school admission rates. We also examine how the waiver of GRE requirements has changed the landscape of BME graduate applications in recent years. Finally, we discuss efforts taken by our institution and others to develop and implement holistic reviews of graduate applications that encourage students from underrepresented backgrounds to apply and successfully gain admission to graduate school. We share five key lessons we learned by performing the retrospective review and encourage other institutions to "" self-reflect "" and examine their historical graduate admissions data and past practices. Efforts aimed at engaging faculty to overcome their own implicit biases, engaging with underrepresented students in hands-on, research-intensive programs, and networking with diverse student populations have strong potential to enhance the diversity of BME graduate programs and our STEM workforce.",Rahbar E

Healthcare management forum,2022,1,Recalibrating healthcare to create a more equitable post-pandemic work environment.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for flexible arrangements, including asynchronous work and working from home. These arrangements may be necessary to comply with public health directives and are manageable when few other options exist. It can be difficult to lead in an environment when team members have divergent core working hours and are not available for collaboration. This can be compounded by the perception of inequitable treatment of employee needs or preferences by management, which can further strain team dynamics. As the pandemic eases, it may be difficult for all employees to revert to a fully on-site arrangement; some may be unable and others unwilling. Leaders will need to consider ethical issues in reaching organizational goals in this new reality. Equity, diversity, and inclusion principles will be critical when balancing the needs of the individual and the team. Supportive arrangements and a culture of inclusion will be key to retaining top talent.",Pyle WG

Forward-thinking healthcare organizations can best position themselves to optimally care for an increasingly diverse patient population and mentor trainees by championing increased diversity in senior faculty ranks, leadership, and governance roles. This article explores several potential solutions to addressing inequities that hinder the advancement of women and URiM faculty. It is intended to complement the recently approved American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) policy statement aimed at overcoming barriers to promotion of women and URiM faculty in academic emergency medicine.

Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,2021,12,Cultivating diversity in the advanced practice registered nurse workforce: An exemplar from an advanced practice registered nurse fellowship program.,"Diversity in the nursing workforce is an important driver of patient satisfaction, adherence to care, and quality outcomes. Systemic barriers exist that prevent individuals from underrepresented minority groups entering and advancing in the nursing workforce. To advance the health of the community we serve and with grant support from the Health Resources and Services Administration, we developed a postgraduate advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) fellowship in community health. This program is a partnership between a federally qualified health center and a college of nursing. We developed a deliberate plan to recruit and admit diverse applicants who would continue to practice in our community at the conclusion of their fellowship year. Using targeted recruitment outreach, we identified new-graduate APRNs who were representative of the community we serve. Using holistic review methodology, we interviewed applicants with explicit efforts to mitigate the effects of bias towards race, ethnicity, gender, and academic affiliation. We embraced a quality-improvement ethos that enabled evolution and growth with each iteration of the program. Understanding that intention does not translate to outcomes, we undertook ongoing critique of our methods and engaged diverse resources to improve our processes. Over two admission cycles, our fellowship in community health for new graduate APRNs has demonstrated improvements in strategies to diversify the community health workforce. We will describe our process of nonjudgmental self-critique and a quality-improvement framework that can serve as a strategy to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the community health workforce.",Raghu N

We also need more diverse graduates to move into education and leadership roles across the country. This article examines the origins and development of doctoral education for nurses in Canada and the continuing dire shortfall of doctorally prepared nurses to meet the expanding needs of the profession. In the context of this desperate shortage, this article then moves to examine the critical issues of equity, diversity and inclusion and the failure of the nursing academy and the profession to address these long-standing matters. These two issues - the shortfall of doctoral graduates and the lack of diversity in education and leadership in nursing - need to be addressed through a combined and focused strategy if we are to ensure the future sustainability of the profession. Given the decade-long lead time required to effect significant changes in doctoral graduations, the article concludes with a call for a national strategy engaging multiple stakeholders to increase awareness of the issues and their implications for the sustainability of the profession. It concludes that only through the united efforts of the profession will Canadian nursing be able to ensure that nursing education will produce a sufficient number of graduates for the needs of education, practice and policy across the country and that these graduates will better reflect the diversity of the nursing profession and the Canadian population, overall.",Nelson S

Preventive medicine reports,2021,12,Framework for advancing equity in academic medicine and science: Perspectives from early career female faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Early-career female faculty, both physician scientists and basic researchers, have disproportionately experienced negative professional, financial, and personal consequences associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This career phase represents a critical time for establishing a network of mentors and collaborators, demonstrating professional independence, and balancing new teaching, research, and service duties while simultaneously navigating personal and familial responsibilities. Persistent gender inequality perpetuated by adherence to traditional gender roles place early-career women faculty at a further disadvantage. Women in academic medicine and research do not attain promotion, leadership positions, and other established markers of success at the same rate as their male counterparts. This disparity was the impetus for the creation of a Recruitment and Retention action group within the Center for Women in Medicine and Science (CWIMS) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (UMN). This perspective piece is written from the viewpoint of a group of female-identifying early-career faculty participating in a career development program for early-stage and newly appointed faculty at UMN, sponsored by the Recruitment and Retention CWIMS action group and our Office of Faculty Affairs. We describe areas of stress exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: work, financial, and work-life well-being, and propose an adapted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) model to guide the response to future challenges within a faculty competency framework. We offer recommendations based on the DEI-competency framework, including opportunities for lasting positive change that can emerge from this challenging moment of our collective history.",Spencer S
Molecular biology of the cell,2021,12,50 Years of Women in Cell Biology: Where have we been? Where are we going?,"It's been 50 years since Women in Cell Biology (WICB) was founded by junior women cell biologists who found themselves neither represented at the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) presentations nor receiving the information, mentoring, and sponsorship they needed to advance their careers. Since then, gender parity at ASCB has made significant strides: WICB has become a standing ASCB committee, women are regularly elected president of the ASCB, and half the symposia speakers are women. Many of WICB's pioneering initiatives for professional development, including career panels, workshops, awards for accomplishments in science and mentoring, and career mentoring roundtables, have been incorporated and adapted into broader ""professional development"" that benefits all members of ASCB. The time has passed when we can assume that all women benefit equally from progress. By strategically, thoughtfully, and honestly recognizing the challenges to women of the past and today, we may anticipate those new challenges that will arise in the next 50 years. WICB, in collaboration with the ASCB, can lead in data collection and access and can promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,12,"Medical Ethics, Moral Courage, and the Embrace of Fallibility.","Experts have an obligation to make difficult decisions rather than offloading these decisions onto others who may be less well equipped to make them. This commentary considers this obligation through the lens of drafting critical care rationing protocols to address COVID-19-induced scarcity. The author recalls her own experience as a member of multiple groups charged with the generation of protocols for how hospitals and states should ration critical care resources like ventilators and intensive care unit beds, in the event that there would not be enough to go around as the COVID-19 pandemic intensified. She identifies several obvious lessons learned through this process, including the need to combat the pervasive effects of racism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination; to enhance the diversity, equity, and inclusion built into the process of drafting rationing protocols; and to embrace transparency, including acknowledging failings and fallibility. She also comes to a more complicated conclusion: Individuals in a position of authority, such as medical ethicists, have a moral obligation to embrace assertion, even when such assertions may well turn out to be wrong. She notes that when the decision-making process is grounded in legitimacy, medical ethics must have the moral courage to embrace fallibility.",Kreitmair KV
Journal of school psychology,2021,12,Single-case design standards: An update and proposed upgrades.,"In this paper, we provide a critique focused on the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Standards for Single-Case Research Design (Standards 4.1). Specifically, we (a) recommend the use of visual-analysis to verify a single-case intervention study's design standards and to examine the study's operational issues, (b) identify limitations of the design-comparable effect-size measure and discuss related statistical matters, (c) review the applicability and practicality of Standards 4.1 to single-case designs (SCDs), and (d) recommend inclusion of content pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion in future standards. Within the historical context of the WWC Pilot Standards for Single-Case Design (1.0), we suggest that Standards 4.1 may best serve as standards for meta-analyses of SCDs but will need to make clear distinctions among the various types of SCD studies that are included in any research synthesis. In this regard, we argue for transparency in SCD studies that meet design standards and those that do not meet design standards in any meta-analysis emanating from the WWC. The intent of these recommendations is to advance the science of SCD research both in research synthesis and in promoting evidence-based practices.",Kratochwill TR

Behaviour research and therapy,2021,12,"Considerations of diversity, equity, and inclusion in mental health apps: A scoping review of evaluation frameworks.","Mental health applications or apps are a promising approach to reduce the pervasive unmet mental health need observed among marginalized groups. However, these groups face unique challenges to engage in and benefit from these interventions, and apps that consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) may be better positioned to reach them. App evaluation frameworks emerge as crucial tools for researchers, clinicians, and users to select evidence-based apps. Nevertheless, it is unclear the extent to which existing assessment tools capture DEI factors. The present scoping review identified 68 studies that employed one or more assessment tools to evaluate a mental health app, leading to 44 unique app evaluation frameworks. Results showed that most frameworks were developed after 2015, and only 58% of them considered at least one DEI criterion. Frameworks that performed exceptionally well were those that combined multiple standardized and validated measures. This lack of consideration for DEI variables may limit the ability of app-based interventions to serve marginalized communities, or even worse, create new disparities. Therefore, we provide recommendations to improve current app evaluation frameworks' cultural robustness and clinical utility, maximizing their effectiveness when working with individuals from marginalized communities.",Ramos G

This personal view intends to highlight the importance of language in an office of diversity and how it can potentially exacerbate the disparities it aims to alleviate. While a diversity office promotes the importance of individual differences, in definition , an office of ""Diversity and Inclusion"" focuses on creating a culture of respect, value, and belonging for all.

Frontiers in psychology,2021,11,"Building a Networked Improvement Community: Lessons in Organizing to Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.","In 2016, 10 universities launched a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) aimed at increasing the number of scholars from Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) populations entering science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty careers. NICs bring together stakeholders focused on a common goal to accelerate innovation through structured, ongoing intervention development, implementation, and refinement. We theorized a NIC organizational structure would aid understandings of a complex problem in different contexts and accelerate opportunities to develop and improve interventions to address the problem. A distinctive feature of this NIC is its diverse institutional composition of public and private, predominantly white institutions, a historically Black university, a Hispanic-serving institution, and land grant institutions located across eight states and Washington, DC, United States. NIC members hold different positions within their institutions and have access to varied levers of change. Among the many lessons learned through this community case study, analyzing and addressing failed strategies is as equally important to a healthy NIC as is sharing learning from successful interventions. We initially relied on pre-existing relationships and assumptions about how we would work together, rather than making explicit how the NIC would develop, establish norms, understand common processes, and manage changing relationships. We had varied understandings of the depth of campus differences, sometimes resulting in frustrations about the disparate progress on goals. NIC structures require significant engagement with the group, often more intensive than traditional multi-institution organizational structures. They require time to develop and ongoing maintenance in order to advance the work. We continue to reevaluate our model for leadership, climate, diversity, conflict resolution, engagement, decision-making, roles, and data, leading to increased investment in the success of all NIC institutions. Our NIC has evolved from the traditional NIC model to become the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) AGEP NIC model with five key characteristics: (1) A well-specified aim, (2) An understanding of systems, including a variety of contexts and different organizations, (3) A culture and practice of shared leadership and inclusivity, (4) The use of data reflecting different institutional contexts, and (5) The ability to accelerate infrastructure and interventions.

A complex interaction across socioecological domains of individual, interpersonal, community/organization, and societal/policy factors influence disparities in tobacco use, treatment, and related health outcomes. NCI's Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) provides an ideal platform to examine and intervene on multilevel influences across the cancer control continuum to reduce any disproportionate tobacco-related burden and eliminate tobacco-related disparities.

This paper highlights how 3 C3I sites intervene to address socioecological influences on tobacco use among racially, ethnically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient subgroups. It then outlines ways in which DEI considerations could be integrated into research with patients with cancer who use tobacco and practices related to standards of cancer care. Incorporating DEI considerations in the pursuit of optimal tobacco treatment could facilitate elimination of inequities in population-level cancer outcomes, spanning the full continuum of cancer care from prevention to survivorship.",

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,11,Towards Antiracism: Using Critical Race Theory as a Tool to Disrupt the Status Quo in Health Professions Education.,"The use of words such as race, racism, antiracism, and antiracist has increased in health professions education (HPE). While the words are used more frequently, additional work is needed to demonstrate a commitment to enhance equity, diversity, and inclusion in HPE. It is important that we contextualize these words, understand the connections between them, and use this information to implement sustainable actions to disrupt the status quo in HPE. Critical race theory is a tool to consider for this journey. In this commentary, the author provides an overview of key concepts ranging from race to critical race theory as a primer to the Research in Medical Education plenary.",Bush AA

With the exception of two years during World War II and one year during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Association has met annually to promote research and education in the biological sciences by providing a student-friendly networking environment. In recent years, the Association has placed an increased focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion among elected and appointed leaders, among participants in the annual meeting, and in the development of funding and other opportunities for students. This work prompted us to review the history of our Association, including periods of racial segregation and inequity, and focus on our current efforts to promote access and inclusion by students and scientists from myriad underrepresented groups. In so doing, the past provides us with the opportunity to cast a vision for the future of the Association. In this paper, we seek to share the journey of the Association of Southeastern Biologists in this regard so that we may be transparent, exposing the missteps and amplifying the successes of our organization.

Frontiers in psychology,2021,10,Instructional Set Moderates the Effect of GRE on Faculty Appraisals of Applicant Competence: A Vignette Study With Implications for Holistic Review.,"While there is movement to create more equitable and holistic admission review processes, faculty continue to place strong emphasis on a single piece of information when making admissions decisions: standardized test scores. This study used an experimental design to test whether instructions provided to faculty prior to assessing doctoral applicants could support holistic review by reducing the weight of the general record examination (GRE) in faculty appraisals of competence and merit for graduate study. Tenured and/or tenure-track faculty ( N =271) were randomly assigned to one of three instructional conditions: Control (no instruction), ""Diamond in the Rough,"" and ""Weed Out."" In addition, faculty participants were randomly assigned to read one of two vignettes of a prospective first-generation student who either received high or average GRE scores. Faculty then rated the applicant's competence using a three-item survey. As expected, faculty who read the vignette describing the candidate with the high GRE rated him as more competent than faculty who read the average GRE vignette. In addition, being instructed to seek out diamonds in the rough buffered the effect of the GRE score on competence. Faculty were also asked to indicate whether they would need additional information to make an admissions decision. They were more likely to ask about grades and research skills than about psychosocial factors that might contextualize the candidate's performance and perceived competence. The results of this study have implications for creating more equitable doctoral admissions processes that center equity, diversity, and inclusion in decision making.",Hernández-Colón IR

Hospital practice (1995),2021,10,We are part of the problem: the role of children's hospitals in addressing health inequity.,"Racism is an ongoing public health crisis that undermines health equity for all children in hospitals across our nation. The presence and impact of institutionalized racism contributes to health inequity and is under described in the medical literature. In this review, we focus on key interdependent areas to foster inclusion, diversity, and equity in Children's Hospitals, including 1) promotion of workforce diversity 2) provision of anti-racist, equitable hospital patient care, and 3) prioritization of academic scholarship focused on health equity research, quality improvement, medical education, and advocacy. We discuss the implications for clinical and academic practice. Plain Language Summary : Racism in Children's Hospitals harms children. We as health-care providers and hospital systems are part of the problem. We reviewed the literature for the best ways to foster inclusion, diversity, and equity in hospitals.

Frontiers in education,2021,10,Supporting Equity and Inclusion of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Individuals in Professional Organizations.,"Disability is an important and often overlooked component of diversity. Individuals with disabilities bring a rare perspective to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) because of their unique experiences approaching complex issues related to health and disability, navigating the healthcare system, creatively solving problems unfamiliar to many individuals without disabilities, managing time and resources that are limited by physical or mental constraints, and advocating for themselves and others in the disabled community. Yet, individuals with disabilities are underrepresented in STEMM. Professional organizations can address this underrepresentation by recruiting individuals with disabilities for leadership opportunities, easing financial burdens, providing equal access, fostering peer-mentor groups, and establishing a culture of equity and inclusion spanning all facets of diversity. We are a group of deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) engineers, scientists, and clinicians, most of whom are active in clinical practice and/or auditory research. We have worked within our professional societies to improve access and inclusion for D/HH individuals and others with disabilities. We describe how different models of disability inform our understanding of disability as a form of diversity. We address heterogeneity within disabled communities, including intersectionality between disability and other forms of diversity. We highlight how the Association for Research in Otolaryngology has supported our efforts to reduce ableism and promote access and inclusion for D/HH individuals. We also discuss future directions and challenges.

Journal of the National Medical Association,2021,10,Academic redlining in medicine.,"Despite concerted efforts over the past decade to increase diversity in U.S. medical schools, persistent applicant and enrollment gaps remain for students from underrepresented racial and economic backgrounds. To understand these gaps, we propose a new theory of 'academic redlining' as a widespread practice in medical schools that systematically excludes students from underrepresented backgrounds from entry into medicine through the nearly universal use of Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) cutoff scores. In this paper, we provide evidence that academic redlining via the MCAT disenfranchises students from underrepresented backgrounds prior to and during the admissions process due to structural racism, and describe the three core mechanisms that cause medical schools to engage in academic redlining: (1) the pursuit of institutional prestige, (2) market competition and pressure, and (3) market bands. Given the persistent lack of diversity in medicine-which contributes to devastating health care disparities-as medical schools redouble their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion, structural alternatives within medical schools' admissions and education practices are offered to curtail the practice of academic redlining in medical school admissions and medicine.",Nakae S
Annals of surgical oncology,2021,10,Persistent Disparities in Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction and Strategies for Mitigation.,"For many women, breast reconstruction is an essential component of the breast cancer care continuum after mastectomy. Despite postmastectomy breast reconstruction now being a standard of care, numerous studies over the past decade have documented persistent racial disparities in breast reconstruction rates, physician referral patterns, and patient knowledge of their reconstructive options. These disparities have disproportionately impacted women of color-most specifically, African American women. Recent data have revealed racial differences in patient comorbidities, informed decision-making satisfaction, and clinical outcomes after breast reconstruction. Explicitly, African American women have significantly more risk factors for complications and less baseline knowledge regarding reconstructive options than white women. With a recent heightened attention focused on social determinants of health, studies designed to improve these racial differences have demonstrated promising results through educational outreach to underserved communities, implementation of tailored legislation promoting inclusion, diversity, and equity, and encouragement of additional recruitment of ethnically underrepresented-in-medicine surgeons. This study uses a targeted review of the literature to provide a summary of racial disparities in breast reconstruction for African American women, with our perspective on opportunities for improvement.",Butler PD

Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care,2021,10,Inclusion and equity: Experiences of underrepresented in medicine physicians throughout the medical education continuum.,"The mission of pediatric medical education is to train the workforce who will provide and innovate child healthcare, including addressing healthcare inequities for children and adolescents of color. A diverse physician workforce is associated with more equitable outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative that our workforce continue to reflect the ever-growing diverse nature of our society. While diversity has been at the forefront of conversations for increasing the number of underrepresented communities in medicine, inclusion and equity are oftentimes overlooked. It is crucial to recognize that while diversity is an important aspect to the UIM experience, the overall impact of diversity is diluted when it is not paired with inclusion and equity. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the experiences that shape inclusion and equity for UIM physicians along the training continuum and how negative factors may impact the wellness and career longevity of UIM physicians. Our study explored the experiences of UIM physicians throughout their medical education through the lens of inclusion and equity by exploring three common factors: social support, racism and discrimination, and well-being and burnout. There may be a perception that stressors, including racial discrimination, diminish with progression through one's educational career; however, this review suggests that these stressors manifest differently relative to the trials inherent to each career stage. By exploring the interplay between these factors and the UIM experience as a continuum, we are better able to discuss effective solutions to diversity, equity and inclusion for UIM physicians.",Brown Z

Journal of microbiology & biology education,2021,9,"Toward ""Inclusifying"" the Underrepresented Minority in STEM Education Research.","Research in undergraduate STEM education often requires the collection of student demographic data to assess outcomes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Unfortunately, this collection of demographic data continues to be constrained by socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity, leading to problematic panethnic groupings such as ""Asian"" and ""Latinx."" Furthermore, these all-encompassing categories of race and ethnicity exasperate the problematic ""underrepresented minority"" (URM) label when only specific races and ethnicities are categorized as URMs. We have long seen calls for improved outcomes related to URMs in undergraduate STEM education, but seldom have we seen our own understanding of what it means to be a URM go beyond socially constructed categories of race and ethnicity. If we aim to not only improve diversity outcomes but also make undergraduate STEM education more equitable and inclusive, we must reevaluate our use of the term ""URM"" and its implications for demographic data collection. The classifications of ""underrepresented"" and ""minority"" are more nuanced than simple racial categories. Though there has been development of alternative terms to URM, each with their own affordances, the main goal of this article is not to advocate for one term over another but rather to spark a much-needed dialogue on how we can ""inclusify"" our collection of racial and ethnic demographic data, particularly through data disaggregation and expanding our definition of what it means to be both ""underrepresented"" and a ""minority"" within STEM.",Bhatti HA

An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.",Coates WC

These conditions allow innovation to thrive and optimize member performance. Unfortunately, despite its evidence-based nature, the field of medicine continues to struggle with providing safe environments for its members. Several cultural barriers to psychological safety permit endemic harassment. These include having large power gradients, a weak ethical climate, and a number of enabling structural factors that maintain a toxic culture. Moving toward psychological safety will be challenging work, as it requires a difficult and complex analysis of the shared value system that enables the status quo. Programs and policies that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion are an important start, but they are likely insufficient on their own to achieve psychological safety. Leadership that models difficult reflection and supports inclusive transformation is the key to a safe culture shift.",Siad FM

Cancer cell,2021,9,TRIM8 modulates the EWS/FLI oncoprotein to promote survival in Ewing sarcoma.,"Fusion-transcription factors (fusion-TFs) represent a class of driver oncoproteins that are difficult to therapeutically target. Recently, protein degradation has emerged as a strategy to target these challenging oncoproteins. The mechanisms that regulate fusion-TF stability, however, are generally unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discovered tripartite motif-containing 8 (TRIM8) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades EWS/FLI, a driver fusion-TF in Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, we identified TRIM8 as a selective dependency in Ewing sarcoma compared with >700 other cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, TRIM8 knockout led to an increase in EWS/FLI protein levels that was not tolerated. EWS/FLI acts as a neomorphic substrate for TRIM8, defining the selective nature of the dependency. Our results demonstrate that fusion-TF protein stability is tightly regulated and highlight fusion oncoprotein-specific regulators as selective therapeutic targets. This study provides a tractable strategy to therapeutically exploit oncogene overdose in Ewing sarcoma and potentially other fusion-TF-driven cancers.",Seong BKA

Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2021,9,Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance: Building Trust to Protect Nursing Home Staff and Residents.,"Vaccines are critical to protect both nursing home residents and staff from COVID-19, but some staff have expressed reservations about being vaccinated. In this brief report, we describe interventions that Genesis HealthCare-one of the largest US long-term care providers-implemented after recognizing midway through vaccinations that racial and ethnic disparities existed in vaccine uptake among employees, with black and Hispanic employees having significantly lower rates of vaccination than their peers. Specifically, Genesis engaged its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to identify ways to augment its already comprehensive vaccine education campaign in order to build confidence among employees from minority communities. Interventions implemented beginning in late January 2021 included adding DEI representatives to information sessions to facilitate culturally sensitive discussions; holding information sessions at all times of day and night, and inviting employees' family members to join; increasing availability of multilingual educational materials; and featuring DEI representatives in social media campaigns. Between the end of January and beginning of March 2021, we observed statistically significant improvements in the likelihood of black and Hispanic employees being vaccinated relative to white employees, calculated as the relative risk of vaccination, suggesting a reduction in vaccination disparity. Whether these trends are directly related to the organization's efforts, or rather reflect individuals needing longer to become comfortable with the vaccines, is difficult to discern in the absence of a formal pragmatic trial. Still, these findings support the continuation of targeted educational and engagement efforts to improve vaccine uptake among staff, and the critical need to ensure that nursing homes have ongoing access to vaccine supply to continue their vaccination programs.",Feifer RA
Pediatrics,2021,9,Innovative Wellness Models to Support Advancement and Retention Among Women Physicians.,"Despite improvements in representation of women in academic medicine, the rate of promotion and career advancement remains unequal. Compared with their male colleagues, women report lower rates of personal-organizational value alignment and higher rates of burnout. Particular challenges further exist for Black women, Indigenous women, women of color, and third gender or gender nonbinary faculty. Promoting the well-being of women physicians requires innovative approaches beyond the traditional scope of physician well-being efforts and careful attention to the unique barriers women face. Three wellness-oriented models are presented to promote the professional fulfillment and well-being of women physicians: (1) redefine productivity and create innovative work models, (2) promote equity through workplace redesign and burnout reduction, and (3) promote, measure, and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. By engaging in innovative models for equitable advancement and retention, it is anticipated that diverse groups of women faculty will be better represented at higher levels of leadership and thus contribute to the creation of more equitable work climates, fostering well-being for women physicians.",Ramas ME

Frontiers in sports and active living,2021,8,Virtual Physical Education During COVID-19: Exploring Future Directions for Equitable Online Learning Tools.,"Introduction: School closures prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced opportunities for US youth to be physically active and disproportionately impacted health disparities in this population. Physical education provides the largest intervention to support the physical activity of school-aged youth, but teachers' opinions about how to maintain quality programming during virtual learning periods remain unexplored. Applying a diversity, equity and inclusion framework, this study explored physical education teachers' perceived significance of different design features for an online teaching tool to promote physical activity equity during school closures. Methods: Previous literature and focus groups informed the development of a survey administered in summer/fall 2020. Survey participants ( n = 60) were physical education teachers from 400 randomly selected US preschool-12th grade schools drawing from a national database. Participants rated the significance of four design features in relation to five key attributes of an online supplement to in-person physical education programs. One-way ANOVAs were used to assess differences in teachers' ratings by demographic characteristics. Results: Between-group differences were found in teacher ratings of design features related to the usability, accessibility, equitability, and formal assessment capabilities of an online physical education tool. Differences were based on teacher gender, school level, and geographic location. Conclusions: Future research to promote physical activity equity among preschool-12th grade youth should examine tailored virtual physical education learning tools that address what teachers perceive to be the most significant design features to support equitable physical education among diverse student groups.",D'Agostino EM
Postgraduate medical journal,2021,8,Grit: what is it and why does it matter in medicine?,"Grit refers to the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals. Grit has emerged as a recent topic of interest within the medical community. With ever-increasing rates of burnout and psychological distress, increasing attention has been directed towards modulatory or protective factors for these deleterious outcomes. Grit has been studied in regard to a variety of outcomes and variables in medicine. This article reviews the current literature on grit in medicine and summarises the current research on grit and performance metrics, personality characteristics, longitudinal progression, psychological well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, burnout and residency attrition. While there is inconclusive evidence on the influence of grit on performance metrics in medicine, research consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between grit and psychological well-being and a negative correlation between grit and burnout. After discussing some of the inherent limitations of this type of research, this article suggests some possible implications and future areas for research and their potential role in cultivating psychologically healthy physicians and promoting successful careers in medicine.",Lee DH
Neurology,2021,8,"Development of an Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Anti-racism Pledge as the Foundation for Action in an Academic Department of Neurology.","Racial inequities as illustrated by the health disparities in COVID19 infections and deaths, the recent killings of Black men and women by law enforcement, and the widening socioeconomic inequality and have brought systemic racism into a national conversation. These unprecedented times may have deleterious consequences, increasing stress, and trauma for many members of the neurology workforce. The Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Anti-Racism Committee within our Department of Neurology provides infrastructure and guidance to foster a culture of belonging and addresses the well-being of faculty, staff, and trainees. Here, we present the creation and implementation of our Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Anti-Racism (EDIA) Pledge which was central to our committee's response to these unprecedented times. We outline the process of developing this unique EDIA Pledge and provide a roadmap for approaching these important topics through a CME Neurology Grand Rounds aimed at fostering a diverse, inclusive, equitable and antiracist work environment. Through the lived experiences of 4 faculty members, we identify the impact of bias and microaggressions, and encourage allyship and personal development for cultural intelligence. We hope these efforts will inspire Neurology departments and other academic institutions across the globe to make a similar pledge.",Gordon Perue GL
Behavior analysis in practice,2021,8,A Look in the Mirror: How the Field of Behavior Analysis Can become Anti-Racist.,"Sparked by recent events, discussions of systemic racism and racial inequalities have been pushed to the foreground of our global society, leading to what is being called the largest modern-day civil rights movement (Buchanan et al., 2020). In the past, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) activists and scholars, among others, have evaluated and critiqued systems and organizations within our society. Nonetheless, it was not until recently that this movement was truly noticed by a greater number of people, some of whom are now further assessing how BIPOC are viewed and treated within their organization and by society as a whole (Worland, 2020). This is not only due to the increase in video evidence (e.g., released body cam footage, social media postings), but also the previous administration's rhetoric and political agenda (Hubler & Bosman, 2021). Police departments, educational institutions, and large companies have, for decades, been under scrutiny for their systems and practices that promote racism, inequality, and inequity. The field of behavior analysis, with its Eurocentric roots and observed lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion, is not exempt from such evaluations. It is time that we take a look in the mirror and evaluate our own professional, research, educational, and clinical practices, and work towards creating a new, more inclusive, field of behavior analysis that promotes anti-racism and cultural humility.",Levy S
Journal of clinical and translational science,2021,8,"Educating for diversity, equity, and inclusion: A review of commonly used educational approaches.","Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are fundamentally important concepts for advancing clinical and translational science (CTS) education.

Over the past 3 decades, they have grown from small groups to large sections within volunteer science organizations. In addition to providing a sense of community and promulgating the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, the WIC sections have contributed to improving workplace culture and dynamics by generating evidence-based and actionable data, fostering leadership by and scientific enrichment of women, developing task forces and health policy documents targeted toward reduction of burnout and bias in medicine, and providing a platform to voice the unique challenges and opportunities of female cardiologists. The future holds great promise, as the WIC sections continue to play a pivotal role by being intentional, transparent, iterative, and sustainable, and working with important stakeholders, including men, to share data, best practices, and strategies to create and maintain a culture of equity and achieve its core principles.",Sharma G
Journal of women's health (2002),2021,8,Representation of Women on Journal Editorial Boards Affiliated with the Association of American Medical College's Council of Faculty and Academic Societies.,"Background:          The Council of Faculty and Academic Societies (CFAS) comprises representatives from medical schools and professional societies who guide the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Given the AAMC's stated mission to improve diversity and inclusion, we used gender-related representation on journal editorial boards as a proxy for evaluating CFAS member societies' commitments to equity.             Methods:          From screenshots of journal mastheads ( n  = 44) collected June 3-6, 2019, individuals were categorized by editorial position. Outcome measures included numbers of men and women among faculty, deans, department chairs, physicians, and nonphysicians on editorial boards. Outcomes were compared with 2018 AAMC and US Bureau of Labor Statistics workforce data.             Results:          Overall, the proportion of women among journal editors was 29.0% (364 of 1,255), range 0%-53.3%. This proportion was significantly less than the proportion of women among US medical school faculty and medical scientists. The lowest percentages of women were found among journals' section or topic editors (19.2%) and editors-in-chief (20.4%). Men were significantly more likely to be a professor or department chair and women were significantly more likely to be an associate professor or assistant professor, suggesting a bidirectional process between rank and editorial position that may inhibit the advancement of academic women, particularly women physicians.             Conclusions:          This study revealed disparities in the equitable representation of women among CFAS member-affiliated journal editors. Because CFAS member societies participate in a mutually beneficial relationship with the AAMC, they should strive to attain the equity goals set forth by the AAMC.",Ellinas EH

Journal of vascular surgery,2021,8,Moral determinants of health: An overview of disparities in healthcare.,"Healthcare disparities are a serious problem that shorten the lives of many Americans, even after accounting for social, cultural, and economic factors and correcting for confounders such as the lack of medical insurance and access to healthcare, black Americans and other minority groups receive worse medical care and experience worse outcomes as a result. Healthcare does not occur in a vacuum; surgeons cannot serve our patients' needs isolated in a bubble and cocooned from larger societal concerns. Although disparities rooted in race likely have the greatest negative effects on our patients' health, plenty of groups exist that have not historically received equal opportunities and acceptance within the surgical world. Despite now accounting for more than one half of all medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions, and the gender pay gap has remained significant in all branches of medicine. It will require active, multifaceted, and sustained effort to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in academic surgery. We have described the steps that can be taken within surgical departments and in national surgical societies to recruit, retain, and foster a diverse surgical workforce and to develop a more inclusive culture within surgery and surgical training.",Dissanaike S
Fertility and sterility,2021,8,The pipeline problem: barriers to access of Black patients and providers in reproductive medicine.,"The demographics of the United States are rapidly changing, and our health care workforce is not keeping pace with the population trends. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (formerly The American Fertility Society) recognizes the need to increase diversity and is committed to promoting diversity across our membership and leadership as well as promoting equitable quality reproductive care to all patients. In the fall of 2020, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine convened a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force to evaluate and make recommendations on the basis of findings to increase diversity to achieve equity and inclusion of reproductive and infertility services for all women. This article focuses on specific barriers that Black or African American patients face in accessing quality care and that provider's face in training and inclusion in reproductive medicine. Multiple publications have confirmed an improvement in health outcome when there is congruence between the patient and the provider. There is a stark contrast between the racial and ethnic diversity of our providers and other support personnel compared with that of our patients. Despite our best intent to minimize the effects of implicit and explicit bias, mistrust and misunderstandings when there is discordance between patients and providers negatively impacts care. To increase provider diversity, it is crucial that we prioritize pipeline programs that recruit and support underrepresented minority in medicine physicians. Specific recommendations are made to increase diversity in the pipeline to improve patient access to culturally competent quality reproductive medicine care with optimal outcomes.",Richard-Davis G

Journal of vascular surgery,2021,8,"Sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression: From current state to solutions for the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning patients and colleagues.","Many of the systemic practices in medicine that have alienated lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals persist today, undermining the optimal care for these patients and isolating LGBTQ medical providers from their colleagues. The 2020 Task Force on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report recently published by the Society for Vascular Surgery marked the first publication advocating for the inclusion of sexual orientation and sexual identity in the development of initiatives promoting and protecting diversity across vascular surgery. Vascular providers should be aware that it is crucial to cultivate an environment that is inclusive for LGBTQ patients because a large proportion of these patients have reported not self-disclosing their status to medical providers, either out of concern over potential personal repercussions or failing to recognize the potential relevance of LGBTQ status to their medical care. Safe Zone training has provided a standard resource for providers and staff that can be integrated into onboarding and routine training. Clarifying the current terminology for sexual orientation and identity will ensure that vascular providers will recognize patients who could benefit from screening for additional vascular risk factors relevant to this population related to sexual health, social behavior, physical health, and medical therapies. The adoption of gender neutral language on intake forms and general correspondence with colleagues is key to reducing the unintended exclusion of those with LGBTQ identities in both inpatient and outpatient environments. In many locales across the United States, the professional and personal repercussions for openly reporting LGBTQ status persist, complicating efforts toward quantifying, recognizing, and supporting these patients, practitioners, and trainees. Contributing to an inclusive environment for patients and peers and acting as a professional ally are congruent with the ethos in vascular surgery to treat all patients and colleagues with respect and optimize the healthcare of every vascular patient.",West-Livingston LN

Journal of vascular surgery,2021,8,"Publication bias is the consequence of a lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion.","Publication bias has been shown to exist in research across medical and surgical specialties. Bias can occur at any stage of the publication process and can be related to race, ethnicity, age, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. Although some improvements have been made toward addressing this issue, bias still spans the publication process from authors and peer reviewers, to editorial board members and editors, with poor inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities throughout. The result of bias remaining unchecked is the publication of research that leaves out certain groups, is not applicable to all people, and can result in harm to some populations. We have highlighted the current landscape of publication bias and strived to demonstrate the importance of addressing it. We have also provided solutions for reducing bias at multiple stages throughout the publication process. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all aspects of the publication process, requiring diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in reports, and providing specific education and guidelines will ensure the identification and eradication of publication bias. By following these measures, we hope that publication bias will be eliminated, which will reduce further harm to certain populations and promote better, more effective research pertinent to all people.",Rouan J
Medical teacher,2019,4,Inclusion in the clinical learning environment: Building the conditions for diverse human flourishing.,"Aim: While diversity, equity, and inclusion are much proclaimed aspirational goals in education programs, the clinical learning environment (CLE) frequently falls short of meaningful incorporation of these concepts in processes, policies, and local culture. In this paper, we explore how inclusion, diversity, and equity can and should be defined and operationalized within medical education. Methods: Three cases, organized around Hafferty's curricular framework (formal, informal, and hidden), we illustrate lapses and potential best practices in inclusion in the CLE. Results: The essential ""best-practice"" of programs inclusive of diverse individuals is the design of policies, processes, and behavioral norms co-creatively with all community members. Potential pitfalls to greater inclusion include nostalgic reference to ""the past"", a neutrality that is operationalized without the rudder of explicit values and not recognizing that ethical obligations between teachers, learners, and programs are at the heart of the discussion of how inclusive learning and work environments are built. Conclusion: Inclusive CLE's provide space for co-creation, understand the need to ensure the voices of the vulnerable (i.e. learners) are heard and valued and through this promote the flourishing of diverse human capital, in keeping with a model that views diversity as a key attribute or organizational excellence.",Razack S
Journal of microbiology & biology education,2021,7,"Antiracist Opportunities in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education : Considerations for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.","Authors in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education (JMBE) have demonstrated a clear commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) through commentaries, instructional approaches, and research. However, analysis of JMBE literature using Kendi's antiracist framework ( How To Be an Antiracist , 2019) offers additional opportunities for growth. These opportunities are discussed and framed under five emergent conceptual categories (ECCs). First, capitalistic goals (e.g., productivity) are often drivers for DEI initiatives but disproportionately benefit those with power. Humanity-centered reasons, like honoring community values, are also important motivations. Second, faculty are often targeted as primary agents of change for DEI, but more powerful stakeholders such as department and institutional leadership can also implement equitable policies and practices to widen the impact of DEI initiatives. Third, study scopes are sometimes focused on the outcomes of inequity (e.g., lower retention rates for students of color) rather than the systemic causes (e.g., exclusivity of science). While outcomes are important to research, studies should create clear connections and distinctions between the systems and symptoms of inequity. Fourth, active learning and authentic research experiences are not automatically inclusive and do not necessarily validate students' identities. Such approaches may be more impactful when tailored for context and student background. Finally, language and communication can have broad impacts on DEI efforts. As a community, we may need to be more critical of our shared language and communication. This review discusses the five ECCs in depth and offers next steps for supporting DEI across the biology and microbiology education community.",Nardi CL

Virtual conferences are sustainable and inclusive regardless of participant mobility (financial means, caring commitments, disability), but lack face-to-face contact. Hybrid conferences (physical meetings with additional virtual presentations) tend to discriminate against non-fliers and encourage unsustainable flying. Multi-hub conferences mix real and virtual interactions during talks and social breaks and are distributed across nominally equal hubs. We propose a global multi-hub solution in which all hubs interact daily in real time with all other hubs in parallel sessions by internet videoconferencing. Conference sessions are confined to three equally-spaced 4-h UTC timeslots. Local programs comprise morning and afternoon/evening sessions (recordings from night sessions can be watched later). Three reference hubs are located exactly 8 h apart; additional hubs are within 2 h and their programs are aligned with the closest reference hub. The conference experience at each hub depends on the number of local participants and the time difference to the nearest reference. Participants are motivated to travel to the nearest hub. Mobility-based discrimination is minimized. Lower costs facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Environmental health insights,2021,7,Leadership for SDG 6.2: Is Diversity Missing?,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the global sanitation sector have not been the subject of extensive investigation or scrutiny. However, without diverse leadership, the sector will continue to experience failure, inefficient use of dwindling resources, and overall low sanitation coverage rates, with 2 billion people lacking sanitation access. This research presents the first quantitative study of sanitation leadership demographics. The results revealed that older, white males from High-Income Countries comprised over a third of all leadership positions. This research found that two-thirds of all sanitation leaders were white, with white leaders 8.7 times more likely to hold multiple positions across different organizations than Black, Indigenous, or other People of Color. Eighty-eight out of one hundred organizations were headquartered in a High-Income Country, and western institutions dominated education data. Black, Indigenous, and other Women of Color were the least represented group, highlighting the importance of an intersectional perspective when discussing gender and racial equality. These issues must be urgently addressed if the Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 targets are to be met effectively. Institutional reform, inclusive hiring policies, and transforming individual attitudes are starting points for change. More organizational data should be made available, and further research needs to be conducted on these topics if a change is to be seen in time for 2030.",Worsham K
Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2021,7,COVID-19 and the Digitalisation of Cardiovascular Training and Education-A Review of Guiding Themes for Equitable and Effective Post-graduate Telelearning.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact leading to novel adaptations in post-graduate medical education for cardiovascular and general internal medicine. Whilst the results of initial community COVID-19 vaccination are awaited, continuation of multimodality teaching and training that incorporates telelearning will have enduring benefit to post-graduate education and will place educational establishments in good stead to nimbly respond in future pandemic-related public health emergencies. With the rise in innovative virtual learning solutions, medical educators will have to leverage technology to develop electronic educational materials and virtual courses that facilitate adult learning. Technology-enabled virtual learning is thus a timely progression of hybrid classroom initiatives that are already adopted to varying degrees, with a need for faculty to serve as subject matter experts, to host and moderate online discussions, and to provide feedback and overall mentorship. As an extension from existing efforts, simulation-based teaching (SBT) and learning and the use of mixed reality technology should also form a greater core in the cardiovascular medicine curriculum. We highlight five foundational themes for building a successful e-learning model in cardiovascular and general post-graduate medical training: (1) digital solutions and associated infrastructure; (2) equity in access; (3) participant engagement; (4) diversity and inclusion; and (5) patient confidentiality and governance framework. With digitalisation impacting our everyday lives and now how we teach and train in medicine, these five guiding principles provide a cognitive scaffold for careful consideration of the required ecosystem in which cardiovascular and general post-graduate medical education can effectively operate. With due consideration of various e-learning options and associated infrastructure needs; and adoption of strategies for participant engagement under sound and just governance, virtual training in medicine can be effective, inclusive and equitable through the COVID-19 era and beyond.",Chong JH
The American naturalist,2021,7,"Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior: A Call for Diversity in Our Model Systems and Discipline.","AbstractEcologists and evolutionary biologists are fascinated by life's variation but also seek to understand phenomena and mechanisms that apply broadly across taxa. Model systems can help us extract generalities from amid all the wondrous diversity, but only if we choose and develop them carefully, use them wisely, and have a range of model systems from which to choose. In this introduction to the Special Feature on Model Systems in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB), we begin by grappling with the question, What is a model system? We then explore where our model systems come from, in terms of the skills and other attributes required to develop them and the historical biases that influence traditional model systems in EEB. We emphasize the importance of communities of scientists in the success of model systems-narrow scientific communities can restrict the model organisms themselves. We also consider how our discipline was built around one type of ""model scientist""-a history still reflected in the field. This lack of diversity in EEB is unjust and also narrows the field's perspective, including by restricting the questions asked and talents used to answer them. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion will require acting at many levels, including structural changes. Diversity in EEB, in both model systems and the scientists who use them, strengthens our discipline.",Duffy MA

Current policies neglect to explicitly address inclusion of the growing population of students with disabilities who rely on service dogs, specifically in accessing teaching and research laboratories. With the increase in students registering for post-secondary disability services, the science community has outgrown general policies that primarily outline steps for exclusion of student service dog handlers. Here we discuss barriers and areas in need of improvement and then outline explicit guidelines for inclusion that are currently absent from existing policies. Particular concerns arise in teaching and research laboratories where live animals are present, and we recommend further research is needed to make informed decisions. In order to realize our vision of a diverse STEM workforce, academic institutions and professionals need to recognize barriers to inclusion and consider their role in making science accessible.",Ramp J

Frontiers in public health,2021,6,"Declaring Racism a Public Health Crisis in the United States: Cure, Poison, or Both?","Declaring racism a public health crisis has the potential to shepherd meaningful anti-racism policy forward and bridge long standing divisions between policy-makers, community organizers, healers, and public health practitioners. At their best, the declarations are a first step to address long standing inaction in the face of need. At their worst, the declarations poison or sedate grassroots momentum toward anti-racism structural change by delivering politicians unearned publicity and slowing progress on health equity. Declaring racism as a public health crisis is a tool that must be used with clarity and caution in order to maximize impact. Key to holding public institutions accountable for creating declarations is the direct involvement of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) led groups and organizers. Sharing power, centering their voices and working in tandem, these collaborations ensure that declarations push for change from the lens of those most impacted and authentically engage with the demands of communities and their legacies. Superficial diversity and inclusion efforts that bring BIPOC people and organizers into the conversation and then fail to implement their ideas repeat historical patterns of harm, stall momentum for structural change at best, and poison the strategy at worst. In this paper we will examine three declarations in the United States and analyze them utilizing evaluative criteria aligned with health equity and anti-racism practices. Finally, we offer recommendations to inform anti-racist public health work for meaningful systematic change toward decentralization and empowerment of communities in their health futures.",Paine L

A broad view of inclusivity is based on an intersectional approach that considers race, geographical location, caring responsibilities, disability, neurodiversity, religion, and LGBTQIA+ identities. We describe the establishment of a diverse stakeholder group to develop practical grass-roots recommendations through which improvements can be advanced. We have developed a manifesto for change, comprising six domains through which academic institutions can drive progress through setting short, medium, and long-term priorities. Interventions will yield rewards in recruitment and retention of a diverse talent pool, leading to enhanced impact and output.",Wedekind L
Journal of interpersonal violence,2021,6,"First, Do No Harm: From Diversity and Inclusion to Equity and Anti-racism in Interpersonal Violence Research and Scholarship.","This article aims to support interpersonal violence (IPV) researchers in promoting diversity and inclusion in their research and scholarship and urges the IPV field to advance a racial equity, anti-oppressive, and justice-driven research agenda. The article discusses a range of factors to consider at each stage of the research process as researchers seek to be inclusive, responsive to diversity concerns, and seek equity. The researcher's perspective and positionality are discussed and the importance of critical self-examination of one's position in relation to the research is emphasized. Participatory and collaborative research processes are recommended, to engage with community partners, strengthen the validity of the findings, and help ensure that the research benefits the participants. Examples illustrate ways researchers might support diversity and inclusion with respect to sampling and measurement, cultural validity, and the conceptualization and operationalization of race. Recommendations are offered to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion when analyzing data, interpreting results, and writing up the study. The importance of a strengths-based approach and structural level analysis is emphasized. This article goes beyond discussion of the minimum, ""do no harm"" standard that researchers should meet in attending to diversity and inclusion in research and urges the pursuit of equity, anti-racism, and justice toward dismantling those structures that perpetuate violence in its many forms. Researchers are encouraged to ask themselves: Where would I situate my research? Is it racist, not racist, or anti-racist? Not all IPV research has the goal of dismantling inequities, but we should aspire that it do so.",Tajima EA
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,6,Gender Bias: Another Rising Curve to Flatten?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the upheaval it is causing may be leading to novel manifestations of the well-established mechanisms by which women have been marginalized in professional roles, robbing the field of the increased collective intelligence that exists when diverse perspectives are embraced. Unconscious bias, gendered expectations, and overt hostility minimize the contributions of women in academic medicine to the detriment of all. The current environment of heightened stress and new socially distant forms of communication may be exacerbating these well-recognized obstacles to women contributing to the field. Of note, none of these actions requires ill intent; all they require is the activation of unconscious biases and almost instinctive preferences and behaviors that favor the comfortable and familiar leadership of men in a time of extreme stress. The authors argue that it is time to investigate the frequency of behaviors that limit both the recognition and the very exercise of women's leadership during this pandemic, which is unprecedented but nevertheless may recur in the future. Leaders in health care must pay attention to equity, diversity, and inclusion given increases in undermining and harassing behaviors toward women during this crisis. The longer-term consequences of marginalizing women may hamper efforts to combat the next pandemic, so the time to flatten the rising gender bias curve in academic medicine is now.",Lewiss RE
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,6,Hispanic Identity and Its Inclusion in the Race Discrimination Discourse in the United States.,"As protests against racism occur all over the United States and medical institutions face calls to incorporate antiracism and health equity curricula into professional training and patient care, the antiracism discourse has largely occurred through a Black/African American and White lens. Hispanics, an umbrella category created by the U.S. government to include all people of Spanish-speaking descent, are the largest minority group in the country. Hispanics are considered an ethnic rather than a racial group, although some Hispanics self-identify their race in terms of their ethnicity and/or country of origin while other Hispanics self-identify with any of the 5 racial categories used by the U.S. government (White, Black/African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). Expanding the antiracism discourse in medicine to include Hispanic perspectives and the diversity of histories and health outcomes among Hispanic groups is crucial to addressing inequities and disparities in health and medical training. A lack of inclusion of Hispanics has contributed to a growing shortage of Hispanic physicians and medical school faculty in the United States as well as discrimination against Hispanic physicians, trainees, and patients. To reverse this negative trend and advance a health care equity and antiracist agenda, the authors offer steps that medical schools, academic medical centers, and medical accreditation and licensing bodies must take to increase the representation of Hispanics and foster their engagement in this evolving antiracism discourse.",Fernández CR
Seminars in perinatology,2021,6,Quality improvement approaches to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in the neonatal intensive care unit.,"Inequities in neonatal care quality and outcomes persist. Current models of neonatal quality improvement (QI) typically involve implementation of standardized approaches to clinical care that seek to provide consistent care to all infants and their families, which may neglect to account for the unique needs of diverse patient populations. Current approaches often fail to track outcome and process measures by important social disparity metrics, such as race/ethnicity and primary language. Despite these shortcomings, use of a QI structure has tremendous potential to address disparities in neonatal care. Crucial components of a QI approach to achieve health equity include: (1) Identifying equity goals from the inception of a project; (2) Inclusion of diverse family members on multidisciplinary teams; (3) Tracking outcome and process measures according to disparity metrics; and (4) Conducting interventions that preferentially address barriers of high-risk social groups. Hospital-system commitment to diversity and inclusion in the healthcare work force, recognition of the impact of unconscious provider bias and advocacy in the greater public health setting are needed to address underlying social inequities that impact neonatal care quality.",Parker MG
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,6,From Diversity and Inclusion to Antiracism in Medical Training Institutions.,"The glaring racial inequities in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating loss of Black lives at the hands of police and racist vigilantes have catalyzed a global reckoning about deeply rooted systemic racism in society. Many medical training institutions in the United States have participated in this discourse by denouncing racism, expressing solidarity with people of color, and reexamining their diversity and inclusion efforts. Yet, the stagnant progress in recruiting, retaining, and supporting racial/ethnic minority trainees and faculty at medical training institutions is well documented and reflects unaddressed systemic racism along the academic pipeline. In this article, the authors draw upon their experiences as early-career physicians of color who have led and supported antiracism efforts within their institutions to highlight key barriers to achieving meaningful progress. They describe common pitfalls of diversity and inclusion initiatives and call for an antiracist approach to systems change. The authors then offer 9 recommendations that medical training institutions can implement to critically examine and address racist structures within their organizations to actualize racial equity and justice.",Argueza BR
American journal of health promotion : AJHP,2021,6,Crossing the Empathy Chasm: Unpacking a Knapsack Full of Unearned Advantage.,"As demand for diversity, equity and inclusion workshops has risen sharply this past year, I'm not the first to observe that the burden for finding solutions, ironically, gets inordinately placed at the feet of people of color. Ironic, of course, because changing the hearts and minds of Whites is a challenge that needs to be met by Whites. McIntosh's White privilege scale has inspired a growing number of other scales that help us examine our unconscious bias, privilege and advantages from our lived experiences. Deepening empathy for people of color is a prerequisite to being of any use whatsoever in a profession committed to health equity. An obvious way to cross the empathy chasm is to be sure those who are accountable for finding solutions have a deep affinity with those who are most directly affected by the problems. In my continued work to cross the empathy chasm, the space I take needs to be as someone intent on listening to, learning from and supporting those with empathy to spare.",Terry PE
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,6,COVID-19 Threatens Progress Toward Gender Equity Within Academic Medicine.,"Women remain underrepresented within academic medicine despite past and present efforts to promote gender equity. The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.",Woitowich NC

An initial published report focused on a retrospective analysis of data in categories such as leadership, conference presentations, and recognition awards. The findings, which highlighted areas in which the Association of Academic Physiatrists had been successful in supporting gender equity as well as areas in which female physiatrists were underrepresented, provided a base from which to strategically focus on closing gaps in representation. The task force developed an action plan that was approved by the Board of Trustees and included strategies aimed at closing gaps and collecting data to determine corresponding effectiveness. Because most of the categories fell under the supervision of various Association of Academic Physiatrists committees, an appointee from each committee (""diversity steward"") liaised with the Women's Task Force.

This time, perhaps, sustained change is within reach. As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity. The provided recommendations can support employer goals of achieving greater equity and value in workforce health, measurably contributing to business success.",Sherman BW
Molecular imaging and biology,2021,6,Visions by Women in Molecular Imaging Network: Antiracism and Allyship in Action.,"Recent events in America in 2020 have stimulated a worldwide movement to dismantle anti-Black racism in all facets of our lives. Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a ""term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically."" In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined ""Visions"" (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals. We would like to specifically acknowledge the Black women who took the time to be interviewed, write perspectives, and share their lived experiences in hopes that it will inspire genuine and lasting change.",Akam E

Between March-May 2019, 17 focus group discussions were conducted-stratified by role and self-identified race/ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation-among 28 faculty/staff and 36 students. Topics included: assessing the current climate, recounting experiences related to roles and identities, and recommending improvements. Transcripts were coded using deductive and inductive approaches. Race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation appeared to affect perceptions of the climate, with nearly all respondents from underrepresented or minoritized groups recounting negative experiences related to their identity. Persons of color, women, and other respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) frequently perceived the climate as ""uncomfortable."" Most felt that UWSPH operates within a structural hierarchy that perpetuates white, male, and/or class privilege and ""protects those in power"" while leaving underrepresented or minoritized groups feeling like ""the way to move up… is to conform"" in order to not be seen as ""someone pushing against the system.""

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,4,Accessible and Adaptable Faculty Development to Support Curriculum Reform in Medical Education.,"Contemporary curricular reform in medical education focuses on areas that current physician-educators were likely not exposed to during medical school, such as interprofessional teamwork; informatics; health care systems improvement; and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, faculty may not be ready to support the planned curricular reform without adequate faculty development to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. In an era with increasing demands on faculty, new approaches that are flexible and adaptable are needed. The University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine implemented a new curriculum in 2016, which constituted a major curricular overhaul necessitating extensive faculty development. Based on this experience, the author proposes 8 guiding principles for faculty development around curricular reform: (1) create a blueprint to inform design and implementation of faculty development activities; (2) build on existing resources, networks, and communities; (3) target different needs and competency levels for different groups of faculty; (4) encourage cocreation in the workplace; (5) promote collaboration between content experts and faculty developers; (6) tap into faculty's intrinsic motivation for professional development; (7) develop curriculum leaders and faculty developers; and (8) evaluate for continuous improvement. Each of these principles is illustrated with examples, and when available, supported by references to relevant literature. Considering the current wave of curricular reform, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, these principles can be useful for other institutions.",van Schaik SM

JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,2021,4,"New Age Mentoring and Disruptive Innovation-Navigating the Uncharted With Vision, Purpose, and Equity.","For individuals aspiring to a career in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, mentorship can shape destiny. Mentorship helps assure safe passage into the specialty, and it influences the arc of professional development across the career continuum. Even before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, technology and social networking were transforming mentorship in otolaryngology. Now, in an increasingly virtual world, where in-person interactions are the exception, mentorship plays an even more pivotal role. Mentors serve as trusted guides, helping learners navigate accelerating trends toward early specialization, competency-based assessments, and key milestones. However, several structural barriers render the playing field unlevel. For medical students, cancellation of visiting clerkships, in-person rotations, and other face-to-face interactions may limit access to mentors. The pandemic and virtual landscape particularly threaten the already-leaky pipeline for underrepresented medical students. These challenges may persist into residency and later career stages, where structural inequities continue to subtly influence opportunities and pairings of mentors and mentees. Hence, overreliance on serendipitous encounters can exacerbate disparities, even amid societal mandates for equity. The decision to take deliberate steps toward mentoring outreach and engagement has profound implications for what otolaryngology will look like in years to come. This article introduces the concept of new age mentoring, shining a light on how to modernize practices. The key shifts are from passive to active engagement; from amorphous to structured relationships; and from hierarchical dynamics to bidirectional mentoring.

"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021,2,What components are important for effective healthcare alliance governance? Findings from a modified Delphi study in New Zealand.,"Alliance governance is a form of governance developed in industry settings and more recently applied to healthcare. The core idea behind alliance governance is to involve the many stakeholders in the system to collaboratively develop a joint programme that promotes an integrated and whole of systems approach to care. Little is known about the model in healthcare, nor what those involved in an alliance should be focused upon. Using a modified Delphi method, this research presents a set of components that research participants agreed should underpin development of an effective alliance governance arrangement. These characteristics include a systems perspective-a truly shared governance protocol based on a shared vision and a common purpose; performance measurement-collecting and using real-time data that depicts the realities of an end-to-end system to establish better and more achievable goals based on alliance performance; a relational perspective to promote trust, respect and collaboration amongst alliance members, who historically have been competing for contracts and resources; structural changes that enable and promote a shared governance system; and, finally, equity and inclusion to ensure a diverse alliance which promotes diversity of ideas, and involvement of all stakeholders in the decision making process. This research is relevant to policymakers seeking to develop effective alliance-type arrangements as well as to those involved in the practice of alliance governance.",Akmal A

Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,2021,2,Who are we now? A demographic assessment of three evolution societies.,"Scientific societies have the potential to catalyze support for communities that have been historically excluded from science. Many of these societies have formed committees to propose and administer initiatives to promote the career and well-being of their members, with a special emphasis on racial and ethnic minorities. Yet, these societies are rarely armed with data to inform their proposals. Three of the evolution societies (American Society of Naturalists, ""ASN""; Society of Systematic Biologists, ""SSB""; Society for the Study of Evolution, ""SSE"") have also formed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committees in the last few years. As a first step in determining the needs of the societies, these committees collected data on the demographic characteristics of the societies' constituents by surveying the attendants of the Evolution 2019 meeting. Here, we report the proportions for different demographic groups in attendance at the meeting and compare these proportions to the demographics of recipients of Ph.D. degrees either in evolutionary biology or in the broader life sciences, as well as population demographics of the USA. Our results indicate that historically excluded groups are still underrepresented across US-based evolutionary biology professional societies. We explore whether demographic composition differs at different professional stages and find that representation for women and LGBTQ+ members decreases as the career stage progresses. We also find some evidence for heterogeneity across societies in terms of racial composition. Finally, we discuss the caveats and limitations of our procedures. Our results will serve to inform future efforts to collect demographic data at the society levels, which should in turn be used to design and implement evidence-based initiatives for inclusion and equity. This report should be a starting point for systematic efforts to characterize the ever-changing representation in evolutionary biology and to work toward the inclusion of all groups.",Rushworth CA

It is now time to stop, listen, and be intentional in efforts to create sustainable policies and programs that shape the ability to deliver culturally competent care to diverse patients, families, professionals, and communities. Our recommendations for how faculty and academia can decolonize nursing education are delineated in this article. All nursing schools and departments should form a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committee, if they have not already done so. DEI committees can help thread Social Determinants of Health throughout the curriculum, highlight and address microaggressions, and develop formal and informal mentorship programs. As nurses, we must continue the discussion of race with humility but without denial and defensiveness. Subtle racist biases may be unintentionally internalized, and it is our moral and ethical responsibility to recognize these and fight them so that they do not result in prejudicial policy, practice, research, and education.

Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,2021,1,"Polypharmacy is a risk factor for mortality, severe chronic kidney disease, and liver disease among privately insured adults with cerebral palsy.","BACKGROUND: Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) have an increased risk for polypharmacy, premature mortality, and early development of several morbidities, including conditions associated with excess medication exposure, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and liver disease. To date, very little is known about the consequence of polypharmacy for adults with CP. OBJECTIVE: To determine if polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk for mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease among adults with CP, before and after adjusting for comorbid neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) and multimorbidity. METHODS: This is an exploratory treatment effectiveness study. Data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart were used for this retrospective cohort study. Adults aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of CP and without severe CKD (stages IV+) and liver disease were identified from the calendar year 2013 and were subsequently followed from January 1, 2014, to death, severe CKD, liver disease, loss to follow-up, or end of study period (December 31, 2017). Diagnosis codes were used to identify NDDs (intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, spina bifida) and 24 relevant morbidities at baseline (i.e., calendar year 2013). Polypharmacy was defined as ≥ 5 medications and hyperpolypharmacy was defined as ≥ 10 medications at baseline. Cox regression models were developed to examine the association (as HR and 95% CI) between polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy with mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease separately, before and after adjusting for covariates (demographics, NDDs, multimorbidity). Exploratory analyses examined the mediating effect of incident severe CKD or liver disease on the association between the exposure (polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy) on outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 9,238 adults with CP, 58.5% had polypharmacy and 29.5% had hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for mortality was 2.14 (95% CI = 1.59-2.89) for polypharmacy and 1.65 (95% CI = 1.31-2.09) for hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for severe CKD was 1.66 (95% CI = 1.17-2.36) for polypharmacy and 1.67 (95% CI = 1.27-2.19) for hyperpolypharmacy. The fully adjusted HR for liver disease was 1.57 (95% CI = 1.27-1.94) for polypharmacy and 1.72 (95% CI = 1.42-2.08) for hyperpolypharmacy. Incident liver disease mediated 5.37% (polypharmacy) and 7.54% (hyperpolypharmacy) of the association between the exposure with incident severe CKD for nonelderly (aged < 65 years), while incident severe CKD mediated 7.05% (polypharmacy) and 6.64% (hyperpolypharmacy) of the association between the exposure with incident liver disease for elderly (aged ≥ 65 years). CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy are robust risk factors for risk of mortality, severe CKD, and liver disease among privately insured adults with CP. While incidence of severe CKD and liver disease had negligible effects on the association between polypharmacy with mortality, there is evidence that they mediate a considerable portion of one another and require further examination.

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021,1,Using Rapid Design Thinking to Overcome COVID-19 Challenges in Medical Education.,"The rapid rise of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the implementation of public health measures on an unprecedented scale. These measures have significantly affected the training environment and the mental health of health care providers and learners. Design thinking offers creative and innovative solutions to emergent complex problems, including those related to training and patient care that have arisen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design thinking can accelerate the development and implementation of solution prototypes through a process of inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Digital technology can be leveraged as part of this process to provide care and education in new or enhanced ways. Online knowledge hubs, videoconference-based interactive sessions, virtual simulations, and technology-enhanced coaching for health care providers are potential solutions to address identified issues. Limitations of this model include inherent bias toward utilitarian instead of egalitarian principles and the subsequent threat to diversity, equity, and inclusion in solutions. Although medical educators have embraced digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to ensure that these changes are sustained.",Thakur A

The theme of this year's summit was 'Strengthening Our Commitment to Racial and Social Justice to Improve Public Health.' Given the ongoing pandemic, the summit was conducted virtually through digital platforms. This program was intended for both BCM and external audiences interested in advancing health equity, diversity and inclusion in healthcare among healthcare providers and trainees, biomedical scientists, social workers, nurses, individuals involved in talent acquisition and development such as hiring managers (HR professionals), supervisors, college and hospital affiliate leadership and administrators, as well as diversity and inclusion excellence practitioners. We had attendees from all regions of the United States, India, Pakistan and the Demographic Republic of the Congo. The content in this Book of Abstracts encapsulates a summary of the research efforts by the BCM COE scholars (which includes post-baccalaureate students, medical students, clinical fellows and junior faculty from BCM) as well as the external summit participants. The range of topics in this year's summit was quite diverse encompassing disparities in relation to maternal and child health (MCH), immigrant heath, cancers, vaccination uptakes and COVID-19 infections. Various solutions were ardently presented to address these disparities including community engagement and partnerships, improvement in health literacy and development of novel technologies and therapeutics. With this summit, BCM continues to build on its long history of educational outreach initiatives to promote diversity in medicine by focusing on programs aimed at increasing the number of diverse and highly qualified medical professionals ready to introduce effective and innovative approaches to reduce or eliminate health disparities. These programs will improve information resources, clinical education, curricula, research and cultural competence as they relate to minority health issues and social determinants of health. The summit received very positive response in terms of zealous participation and outstanding evaluations; and overall, it was a great success. Copyright © 2021 Dongarwar et al.

International review of education. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Erziehungswissenschaft. Revue internationale de pedagogie,2021,1,Fostering diversity work as a process of lifelong learning: A partnership case study with an immigrant services organisation.,"Diversity work is an area of growing interest for organisations in both the private and public sectors. In a nutshell, the term refers to the work conducted within an organisation that promotes inclusive and equitable engagement with people and communities across social differences such as gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and religion. Related research has generated relatively more knowledge about the challenges and problems of diversity initiatives than about effective practices that genuinely foster social equity and inclusion. This article contributes to the latter with a partnership case study involving the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.), a large non-profit immigrant services organisation headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Specifically, the study presented here focuses on the organisational practices that are constitutive of frontline workers' engagement with diversity work and learning. It shows that (1) building a diverse and inclusive organisation, (2) supporting continuous learning opportunities at work, and (3) providing diversity training, both directive and generative, form the organisation's diversity ""curriculum"". This study also demonstrates that the strength of this workplace curriculum is that it has the potential to challenge the boundary between instrumentalism (harnessing diversity work to business success) and equity activism (prioritising diversity work in its own right), and that it creates space for collective reflection in the presence of others. Conceptually drawing on the practice turn in social sciences, particularly Steven Billet and Jennifer Newton's learning practice , and what David Boud terms "" the reflective turn"", this article positions diversity work as a reflective and iterative process of lifelong learning for both organisations and individual workers.",Shan H

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2020,12,Beyond Technical Standards: A Competency-Based Framework for Access and Inclusion in Medical Education.,"Efforts to include people with disability as students and practitioners in the health professions have gained momentum in recent years. However, prevailing technical standards at U.S. medical schools have biases that can prevent or impede their admission, promotion, and graduation. These standards derive from an approach first promulgated in 1979 and have since remained largely unaltered. Current technical standards at most medical schools are now at odds with changes occurring since the 1990 enactment of broad civil rights protections for people with disability and current aspirations for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the medical profession. It is time to replace the technical standards construct with an approach more consistent with current medical practices, and with societal imperatives of equity and social justice. Such an approach should assess candidates' demonstrable skills and merits, rather than relying on a preconceived construct identifying the presence or absence of defined levels of ability. The maturation of competency-based approaches to curricular design and assessment provides an opportunity to reconceptualize the abilities required to practice medicine, foster the appropriate inclusion of physicians with disability, and better align medical education and training with broader societal needs and goals.",Curry RH

Implicit Association Tests (IATs) offer a validated means of evaluating unconscious associations and preferences. This study examines the perceived role of implicit bias in faculty development in academic emergency medicine (EM). Methods EM faculty at a large urban academic medical center were invited to independently participate in a self-reflection assessment in preparation for a faculty retreat session discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants completed two IATs designed to examine gender associations (gender IAT) and race preferences (race IAT) followed by a short anonymous survey where IAT scores were recorded. The survey also captured demographic information and perceptions about the impact of gender and racial biases in faculty development. Results Forty faculty members (66%) completed the survey; 70% were male and 80% white. The majority (59%) reported gender IAT results indicating automatic male-sciences and female-liberal arts associations. Nearly half (45%) reported race IAT results indicating an automatic preference for white people. More than 70% of males reported that faculty recruitment, development, and promotion decisions were 'never' or 'seldom' affected by gender bias, while more than 80% reported racial bias 'never' or 'seldom' affects these decisions. Female faculty more frequently perceived adverse effects of unconscious gender and race biases. Conclusion Our group of academic physicians reported IAT results showing different levels of implicit bias compared to the general population. Female faculty may be both more aware of and more susceptible to the adverse effects of unconscious biases. Further study is needed to determine both the extent to which unconscious biases affect the academic workplace, as well as ways in which such unintentional forms of discrimination can be eliminated. Unconscious biases are not unique to EM. Intentional efforts to increase self-awareness of these 'blind spots' may help mitigate their impact and foster a more diverse and inclusive healthcare environment.",Cleveland Manchanda EC

The National Science Foundation has funded the creation of the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success (ACCESS), a meta-organization bringing together representatives from several such STEM society committees to serve as a hub for a growing community of practice. Our goal is to coordinate efforts to advance inclusive practices by sharing experiences and making synergistic discoveries about what works.

American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2020,11,Has a critical mass of women resulted in gender equity in gynecologic surgery?,"Gender equity in medicine and surgery has recently received widespread attention. Unlike surgical specialties that remain predominantly male, the majority of obstetrician-gynecologists have been women for nearly a decade, and women have composed the majority of trainees since the 1990s. Despite a critical mass of women, biases related to gender persist in the field. Professional and behavioral expectations of men and women gynecologists remain different for patients and workplace colleagues. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are still experienced at high rates by both trainees and obstetrician-gynecologists in practice. In addition, in other surgical fields, women gynecologic surgeons face a gender wage gap that is unexplained by differences in experience, hours worked, or subspecialty training. Academic advancement and the attainment of leadership positions remain a challenge for many women. Policies related to pregnancy and parenting may disproportionately affect the careers of women gynecologists. This article presents peer-reviewed evidence relevant to gender equity in the workplace and suggests proactive interventions to ensure diversity and inclusion for gynecologic surgeons.",Heisler CA

Headache,2020,11,Equity of African American Men in Headache in the United States: A Perspective From African American Headache Medicine Specialists (Part 1).,"Migraine and severe headache affect approximately 1 in 6 U.S. adults and migraine is one of the most disabling disorders worldwide. Approximately 903,000 to 1.5 million African American (AA) men are affected by migraine in the United States. Racial disparities in headache medicine exist. In addition, there are limited headache studies that attest to the inclusion of or have robust data on AA men in headache medicine in the United States. Racial concordance between provider and patient may ameliorate some aspects of care disparities. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that diversity and inclusion particularly in leadership of organizations has consistently produced positive change, increased innovation, and long-term success. Most national headache organizations strive to improve the care and lives of people living with headache disorders yet only ~0.5% of their physician members are AA men. Herein, we provide an observation of equity issues from the perspective of AA men in the headache medicine subspecialty. Part 1 of this manuscript explores inherent and potential challenges of the equity of AA men in headache medicine including headache disparities, mistrust, understudied/lack of representation in research, cultural differences, implicit/explicit bias, and the diversity tax.

Translational behavioral medicine,2020,10,Lessons learned from the initial 4 years of the SBM Mid-Career Leadership Institute.,"In 2015, the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) created the Mid-Career Leadership Institute. The initial model that motivated the creation of the institute came from my participation in the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program, specifically designed to enhance the leadership skills of senior female faculty in the health sciences. My participation in ELAM was transformative. It led me to run for president of SBM in 2014, to consider how behavioral scientists could similarly benefit from mid-career leadership training, and ultimately to work with the SBM Executive Director, the SBM Leadership Institute Steering Committee, and leadership training professionals to launch the Leadership Institute in 2016. The overarching goal of the SBM Leadership Institute is to train mid-career behavioral scientists engaged in academic and health care settings to develop essential skills needed to navigate the unique challenges of mid-career. Central to this goal is a focus on integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into their emerging leadership roles through participation in training exercises, lectures, and dynamic group discussions. To optimize the Leadership Institute experience, opportunities were developed, including mentoring from SBM seasoned members, peer mentoring through the creation of ""learning communities,"" career coaching, and additional networking opportunities. The purpose of this brief commentary is to summarize lessons learned by highlighting program evaluation, describing key changes over the initial 4 years, and sharing future plans for leadership training.",Fitzgibbon ML

American journal of epidemiology,2020,10,Diversity and Political Leaning: Considerations for Epidemiology.,"The positive effects of increased diversity and inclusion in scientific research and practice are well documented. In this issue, DeVilbiss et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;189(10):998-1010) present findings from a survey used to collect information to characterize diversity among epidemiologists and perceptions of inclusion in the epidemiologic profession. They capture identity across a range of personal characteristics, including race, gender, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, religion, and political leaning. In this commentary, we assert that the inclusion of political leaning as an axis of identity alongside the others undermines the larger project of promoting diversity and inclusion in the profession and is symptomatic of the movement for ""ideological diversity"" in higher education. We identify why political leaning is not an appropriate metric of diversity and detail why prioritizing ideological diversity counterintuitively can work against equity building initiatives. As an alternative to ideological diversity, we propose that epidemiologists take up an existing framework for research and practice that centers the voices and perspectives of historically marginalized populations in epidemiologic work.",Allen B

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2020,10,Achieving Gender Equity Is Our Responsibility: Leadership Matters.,"Across academic medicine, and particularly among faculty and medical school leadership, the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to gender diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Association of American Medical Colleges has launched a bold gender equity initiative, endorsed by its Board of Directors, to implore academic medical institutions to take meaningful and effective actions.Defining what progress should look like to guide these actions is worth deeper exploration. It is not enough to measure the representation of different genders at various levels of leadership within our institutions. Research and experience we share suggests more must be done, especially for women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. What is needed is a fundamental conversation about privilege, intersectionality across different backgrounds, and progress.Institutional leaders have a choice to make. Will we make gender equity a top priority system-wide because we recognize that doing so leads to organizational excellence? Do we understand that establishing a robust, comprehensive definition of gender equity and how it is practiced will result in better outcomes for all? And are we ready and able to prioritize and be accountable for efforts that are measurable, with clear definitions of progress; driven and reinforced by leadership directives; inclusive of all, including men as well as women of diverse backgrounds and orientations; and systemic rather than ad-hoc? Implementing such actions requires initiating difficult conversations, making conscious choices, and modeling best practices from leaders who have successfully made gender equity a priority.",Acosta DA
PLoS computational biology,2020,10,Ten simple rules for building an antiracist lab.,"Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.",Chaudhary VB
Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2020,10,Where Are We in Bridging the Gender Leadership Gap in Academic Medicine?,"In nearly all walks of life, leadership sets the tone for what gets done, who does it, and how it is achieved. In 2020, the top ranks of academic medicine have not yet attained gender parity-an aspirational goal set 7 years ago in this journal as ""50:50 by 2020,"" and a vital aim for the United States' productivity and innovation as a leader in biomedical research. Parity in academic leadership for women and other groups underrepresented in science and medicine will seed the culture change necessary for inclusive excellence: environments in which individuals from all backgrounds thrive in their pursuit of new knowledge to benefit human health.In this Invited Commentary, the author describes the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) current system-wide framework and tools for creating cultures of inclusive excellence through a set of guiding principles and integrated strategies. Successful efforts will recognize that individually focused solutions are necessary but not sufficient for institutional culture change. In keeping with a systems approach are implementing accountability and transparency; establishing clear metrics of inclusion, diversity, and equity; tracking and evaluating such metrics; as well as tying these metrics to institutional reward systems. These essential steps to institutional culture transformation require strong partnerships between NIH and the academic community.

Nature ecology & evolution,2020,10,Improving sex and gender identity equity and inclusion at conservation and ecology conferences.,"Conferences are important for professional learning and for building academics' reputations and networks. All members of the scientific community should feel supported and free to contribute their best at such events. I evaluated the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation since 2009, to assess whether conferences support participation across sexual orientations and gender identities. Although half of the 30 conferences had codes of conduct promoting equity, diversity and inclusion, the quantity and quality of initiatives to support such principles varied between societies and years. Conferences with codes were significantly more likely to implement structural initiatives to minimize discrimination or harassment, such as procedures for reporting misconduct and submission guidelines to promote speaker diversity, as well as initiatives to support parents. Initiatives minimizing barriers to attendance were rare; 47% of conferences were held in locations that discriminate against certain identities and <10% promoted event safety and accessibility to potential attendees. Piecemeal actions and inadequate conference evaluation have resulted in no significant growth in gender equity or diversity initiatives. I propose a six-step timeline that improves conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.",Tulloch AIT

American journal of epidemiology,2020,10,Epidemiologists Count: The Role of Diversity and Inclusion in the Field of Epidemiology.,"We present interpretations of the idea that ""epidemiologists count"" in response to the current status of membership and diversity and inclusion efforts within the Society for Epidemiological Research (SER). We review whom epidemiologists count to describe the (mis)representation of SER membership and how categorizations of people reflect social constructions of identity and biases that exist in broader society. We argue that what epidemiologists count-how diversity and inclusion are operationalized-has real-world implications on institutional norms and how inclusive/non-inclusive environments are. Finally, we examine which epidemiologists count within the field and argue that inclusion can only be achieved when we address how resources and opportunities are distributed among epidemiologists. To improve diversity and inclusion within SER and beyond, we recommend that SER strengthen its commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity by: 1) integrating this priority on all agendas; 2) enhancing efforts to improve self-awareness among members and accountability within the organization; 3) supporting the growth of a diversifying workforce in epidemiology; and 4) increasing the visibility of health disparities research and researchers in epidemiology.",Ðoàn LN
American journal of epidemiology,2020,10,Recommendations to the Society for Epidemiologic Research for Further Promoting Diversity and Inclusion at the Annual Meeting and Beyond.,"Increasing diverse engagement in the Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER) will positively impact the field of epidemiology. As the largest and longest-running epidemiologic society in North America, SER has long been a pioneer in promoting diversity and inclusion. A recent survey of SER members, however, showed there is still room for improving diversity, inclusion, representation, and participation in the Society. In this commentary, as members of both the SER and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Epidemiology's Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Anti-Racism, and Science (Epi IDEAS) Working Group, we recommend 4 goals for the SER Annual Meeting and beyond: 1) convene epidemiologic researchers with diverse backgrounds and ideas; 2) promote an inclusive environment at the SER Annual Meeting; 3) develop, compile, and disseminate best practices to honor diversity in epidemiologic research; and 4) increase prioritization of health disparities research and methods. We also suggest strategies for achieving these goals so that SER can better include, support, and elevate members from historically disadvantaged groups. While our recommendations are tailored specifically to SER, the greater epidemiologic and academic communities could benefit from adopting these goals and strategies within their professional societies and conferences.",Zhang M

As underrepresented minority scientists in the early and late stages of our scientific training, we frame the trainee experience to provide insight from unique perspectives. This essay also provides actionable items that the cell biology community can implement to promote inclusivity. We anticipate that initiating an open dialogue focused on diversity and inclusion will promote growth in the field of cell biology and enable scientists to assess and assume their role in creating welcoming environments. We believe that scientists at all stages in their careers can make meaningful and habitual contributions to supporting inclusivity in cell biology, thereby creating a future where diversity, equity, and inclusion are expected, not requested.",Termini CM

Plant direct,2020,9,Plant science decadal vision 2020-2030: Reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future.,"Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and ""green infrastructure."" Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a ""parts store"" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.",Henkhaus N

Frontiers in sociology,2020,8,A Call for Culturally Responsive Transformational Leadership in College Sport: An Anti-ism Approach for Achieving Equity and Inclusion.,"A longstanding fact in college sports in the United States (U.S.) is the reality that inequities, inequalities, and discrimination have been major issues preventing institutions from fostering harmonious diversity and inclusion. Several reasons for these persistent outcomes include the prevalence of implicit bias, homologous reproduction, hegemonic, and toxic masculinity/patriarchy, colorblind racism, and abstract liberalism to name a few. In addition, multi-level factors (macro-, meso-, and micro-) also influence the existence and salience of negative organizational cultures and climates particularly for groups that are underrepresented and marginalized in society. Despite the fact several leadership styles have been enacted and numerous policy reforms have been adopted over the years, inequities in representation, occupational mobility, position retention, and quality of experiences persist along racial and gender lines. As a result, the purpose of this manuscript is to offer innovative transformational leadership approaches that incorporate anti-racism, anti-sexism, and culturally responsive stances toward achieving true equity and inclusiveness in sport. Using interdisciplinary theories such as the anti-racism framework and culturally responsive leadership, this manuscript presents a paradigm shift for college sport leadership with the intent of cultivating paramount experiences for people across diverse backgrounds.",Cooper JN

Cureus,2020,6,Gender Disparity in Academic Rank and Productivity Among Public Health Physician Faculty in North America.,"Background The issue of gender disparity is particularly important in the domain of public health where the tone of its leadership is pivotal in bringing about impactful change to research, policies, and the wellbeing of our various populations. Our aim is to explore the gender disparity of author metrics and academic rankings of public health physician faculty through a cross-sectional study. Methods Data collection for this retrospective cross-sectional study took place during June and July of 2017. Public health and preventive medicine residency training programs in the United States and Canada were to compiled and all faculty members that met the inclusion criteria were recorded (n = 973). Variables of interest include gender, h-index, years of active research, and academic appointments. SCOPUS database (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was used to generate author metrics, and all statistical tests were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Overall, 31.14% (n = 303) of faculty members we studied were from Canada, and 68.86% (n = 670) were from the United States. In both countries, males made up the majority of all faculty members. Female faculty comprised most of the early career positions, and their proportions tapered off with higher academic rank, whereas male faculty trended in the opposite direction. Males generally were higher in all academic measures across all appointments.  Conclusions  Gender disparity exists within the North American public health and preventive medicine discipline. There are underlying factors preventing women from moving beyond early career positions or engaging in academic research.",Lee D
CBE life sciences education,2020,6,Scientific Societies Fostering Inclusive Scientific Environments through Travel Awards: Current Practices and Recommendations.,"Diversity-focused committees continue to play essential roles in the efforts of professional scientific societies to foster inclusion and facilitate the professional development of underrepresented minority (URM) young scientists in their respective scientific disciplines. Until recently, the efforts of these committees have remained independent and disconnected from one another. Funding from the National Science Foundation has allowed several of these committees to come together and form the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success, herein referred to as ACCESS. The overall goal of this meta-organization is to create a community in which diversity-focused committees can interact, synergize, share their collective experiences, and have a unified voice on behalf of URM trainees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. In this Essay , we compare and contrast the broad approaches that scientific societies in ACCESS use to implement and assess their travel award programs for URM trainees. We also report a set of recommendations, including both short- and long-term outcomes assessment in populations of interest and specialized programmatic activities coupled to travel award programs.",Segarra VA
Journal of behavioral medicine,2017,2,The ConNECT Framework: a model for advancing behavioral medicine science and practice to foster health equity.,"Health disparities persist despite ongoing efforts. Given the United States' rapidly changing demography and socio-cultural diversity, a paradigm shift in behavioral medicine is needed to advance research and interventions focused on health equity. This paper introduces the ConNECT Framework as a model to link the sciences of behavioral medicine and health equity with the goal of achieving equitable health and outcomes in the twenty-first century. We first evaluate the state of health equity efforts in behavioral medicine science and identify key opportunities to advance the field. We then discuss and present actionable recommendations related to ConNECT's five broad and synergistic principles: (1) Integrating Context; (2) Fostering a Norm of Inclusion; (3) Ensuring Equitable Diffusion of Innovations; (4) Harnessing Communication Technology; and (5) Prioritizing Specialized Training. The framework holds significant promise for furthering health equity and ushering in a new and refreshing era of behavioral medicine science and practice.",Alcaraz KI

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2020,5,Toward Creating Equity in Awards Received During Medical School: Strategic Changes at One Institution.,"Membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AΩA) is a widely recognized achievement valued by residency selection committees and employers. Yet research has shown selection favors students from racial/ethnic groups not underrepresented in medicine (not-UIM). The authors describe efforts to create equity in AΩA selection at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, through implementation of a holistic selection process, starting with the class of 2017, and present outcomes.Informed by the definition of holistic review, medical school leaders applied strategic changes grounded in evidence on inclusion, mitigating bias, and increasing opportunity throughout the AΩA selection process. These addressed increasing selection committee diversity, revising selection criteria and training committee members to review applications using a new instrument, broadening student eligibility and inviting applications, reviewing blinded applications, and making final selection decisions based on review and discussion of a rank-ordered list of students that equally weighted academic achievement and professional contributions.The authors compared AΩA eligibility and selection outcomes for 3 classes (2014-2016) during clerkship metric-driven selection, which prioritized academic achievement, and 3 classes (2017-2019) during holistic selection. During clerkship metric-driven selection, not-UIM students were 4 times more likely than UIM students to be eligible for AΩA (P = .001) and 3 times more likely to be selected (P = .001). During holistic selection, not-UIM students were 2 times more likely than UIM students to be eligible for AΩA (P = .001); not-UIM and UIM students were similarly likely to be selected (odds ratio = .7, P = .12)This new holistic selection process created equity in representation of UIM students among students selected for AΩA. Centered on equity pedagogy, which advocates dismantling structures that create inequity, this holistic selection process has implications for creating equity in awards selection during medical education.",Teherani A

JMIR mental health,2020,4,Advancing E-Mental Health in Canada: Report From a Multistakeholder Meeting.,"The need for e-mental health (electronic mental health) services in Canada is significant. The current mental health care delivery models primarily require people to access services in person with a health professional. Given the large number of people requiring mental health care in Canada, this model of care delivery is not sufficient in its current form. E-mental health technologies may offer an important solution to the problem. This topic was discussed in greater depth at the 9th Annual Canadian E-Mental Health Conference held in Toronto, Canada. Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include (1) the importance of trust, transparency, human centeredness, and compassion in the development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; (2) an emphasis on equity, diversity, inclusion, and access when implementing e-mental health services; (3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to engage in a digital way of working; and (4) co-production of e-mental health services among a diverse stakeholder group becoming the standard way of working.",Strudwick G
PloS one,2020,4,Comparing demographics of signatories to public letters on diversity in the mathematical sciences.,"In its December 2019 edition, the Notices of the American Mathematical Society published an essay critical of the use of diversity statements in academic hiring. The publication of this essay prompted many responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather, asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically against diversity statements, calling them ""a mistake,"" and claiming that their usage during early stages of faculty hiring ""diminishes mathematical achievement."" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities. Our empirical results are consistent with theories of power drawn from the social sciences.",Topaz CM
Journal of the American Heart Association,2020,4,"Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity: Evolution of Race and Ethnicity Considerations for the Cardiology Workforce in the United States of America From 1969 to 2019.","Since 1969, racial and ethnic preferences have existed throughout the American medical academy. The primary purpose has been to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics within the physician workforce as they were deemed to be ""underrepresented in medicine."" To this day, the goal continues to be population parity or proportional representation. These affirmative action programs were traditionally voluntary, created and implemented at the state or institutional level, limited to the premedical and medical school stages, and intended to be temporary. Despite these efforts, numerical targets for underrepresented minorities set by the Association of American Medical Colleges have consistently fallen short. Failures have largely been attributable to the limited qualified applicant pool and legal challenges to the use of race and ethnicity in admissions to institutions of higher education. In response, programs under the appellation of diversity, inclusion, and equity have recently been created to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics as medical school students, internal medicine trainees, cardiovascular disease trainees, and cardiovascular disease faculty. These new diversity programs are mandatory, created and implemented at the national level, imposed throughout all stages of academic medicine and cardiology, and intended to be permanent. The purpose of this white paper is to provide an overview of policies that have been created to impact the racial and ethnic composition of the cardiology workforce, to consider the evolution of racial and ethnic preferences in legal and medical spheres, to critically assess current paradigms, and to consider potential solutions to anticipated challenges.",Wang NC
Journal of genetic counseling,2020,4,Summary report of the 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Task Force of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.,"The size and reach of the genetic counseling profession have expanded on a global scale since the 1970s. Despite this growth, the profession of genetic counseling has remained demographically homogenous. Promoting a culture of inclusivity that supports visible and invisible diversity and leveraging that culture not only expands perspectives represented in the field, but also helps foster equity in genetic services. This report summarizes the formation, implementation, and outcomes of the 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Task Force (TF) of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), including the group's responses to their allotted charges from the NSGC Board of Directors. The recommendations generated by the TF aim to aid in the (1) establishment of infrastructure for ongoing diversity, inclusion, and equity (DEI) work by collaborating with a DEI organizational expert and forming a DEI advisory group within the NSGC, (2) development of specific short-term DEI initiatives, and (3) identification of seven areas of focus areas that must be addressed in order to create meaningful and measurable DEI improvements.

However, despite decades of diversity initiatives, minimal gains in the percentage of genetic counselors with minority identities have been realized. In order to gather information about DICE efforts, two surveys were created and distributed to genetic service providers, trainees, and genetic counseling program faculty yielding a total of 76 responses. Additionally, a literature scan was performed to gain an understanding of past and ongoing DICE efforts in the career. Three emerging domains resulted from quantitative and qualitative analysis of the submitted data: (1) Categories of DICE Projects, (2) Parties Carrying Out DICE Projects, and (3) What is Missing? Overall, inclusion efforts are notably underrepresented among DICE projects. Also, DICE efforts are generally under-supported, unfunded, and under-recognized as work-related responsibilities. To enhance DICE within the genetic counseling profession, we recommend developing additional research and projects focused on career inclusion and equity, implementing policies requiring DICE training for leaders within the field, encouraging project evaluation and outcomes dissemination, and creating a well-maintained web-based centralized repository for DICE resources.",Channaoui N

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2020,2,"The Not Underrepresented Minorities: Asian Americans, Diversity, and Admissions.","Several lawsuits have recently been filed against U.S. universities; the plaintiffs contend that considerations of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions discriminate against Asian Americans. In prior cases brought by non-Latino whites, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these considerations, arguing that they are crucial to a compelling interest to increase diversity. The dissenting opinion, however, concerns the possibility that such policies disadvantage Asian Americans, who are considered overrepresented in higher education. Here, the authors explain how a decision favoring the plaintiffs would affect U.S. medical schools. First, eliminating race and ethnicity in holistic review would undermine efforts to diversify the physician workforce. Second, the restrictions on considering race/ethnicity in admissions decisions would not remedy potential discrimination against Asian Americans that arise from implicit biases. Third, such restrictions would exacerbate the difficulty of addressing the diversity of experiences within Asian American subgroups, including recognizing those who are underrepresented in medicine. The authors propose that medical schools engage Asian Americans in diversity and inclusion efforts and recommend the following strategies: incorporate health equity into the institutional mission and admissions policies, disaggregate data to identify underrepresented Asian subgroups, include Asian Americans in diversity committees and support faculty who make diversity work part of their academic portfolio, and enhance the Asian American faculty pipeline through support and mentorship of students. Asian Americans will soon comprise one-fifth of the U.S. physician workforce and should be welcomed as part of the solution to advancing diversity and inclusion in medicine, not cast as the problem.",Ko M

AEM education and training,2019,12,Advancing Diversity and Inclusion: An Organized Approach Through a Medical Specialty Academy.,"The benefits of a diverse workforce in medicine have been previously described. While the population of the United States has become increasingly diverse, this has not occurred in the physician workforce. In academic medicine, underrepresented in medicine (URiM) faculty are less likely to be promoted or retained in academic institutions. Studies suggest that mentorship and engagement increase the likelihood of development, retention, and promotion. However, it is not clear what form of mentorship creates these changes. The Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine (ADIEM), an academy within the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, is a group focused on advancing diversity and inclusion as well as promoting the development of its URiM students, residents, and faculty. The Academy serves many of the functions of a mentoring program.

The increasing participation and leadership of women in dental and craniofacial research and within the IADR were viewed from the perspective of a changing culture of science. The steps that have been taken by the IADR to develop greater inclusiveness are acknowledged, and some of the challenges that remain are discussed in terms of obstacles that are most often social or cultural in origin. Comparisons are made across countries, and the social determinants that lead to differences in women's participation are described. Recommendations are made for developing strategies to change elements of our institutional cultures that have provided advantages to some groups of researchers more than to others.

Advances in dental research,2019,12,Gender Inequalities in the Dental Workforce: Global Perspectives.,"The aim of this review is to investigate the growth of diversity and inclusion in global academic dental research with a focus on gender equality. A diverse range of research methodologies were used to conduct this review, including an extensive review of the literature, engagement of key informants in dental academic leadership positions around the world, and review of current data from a variety of national and international organizations. Results provide evidence of gender inequalities that currently persist in dental academics and research. Although the gender gap among graduating dental students in North America and the two most populous countries in Europe (the United Kingdom and France) has been narrowed, women make up 30% to 40% of registered dentists in countries throughout Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. In academic dentistry around the globe, greater gender inequality was found to correlate with higher ranking academic and leadership positions in the United States, United Kingdom, several countries in European Union, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. Further disparities are noted in the dental research sector, where women make up 33% of dental researchers in the European Union, 35% in North America, 55% in Brazil, and 25% in Japan. Family and societal pressures, limited access to research funding, and lack of mentoring and leadership training opportunities are reported as also contributing to gender inequalities. To continue advancing gender equality in dental academia and research, efforts should be geared toward the collection and public dissemination of data on gender-specific distributions. Such evidence-driven information will guide the selection of future strategies and best practices for promoting gender equity in the dental workforce, which provides a major pipeline of researchers and scholars for the dental profession.",Tiwari T
Creative nursing,2019,11,Diverse Representation in Nursing Leadership: Developing a Shared Position Statement on Allyship.,"Diversity initiatives are being implemented widely within academia and society more broadly; however, the School of Nursing (SoN) at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, is taking an innovative approach. Faculty members recognized the need to support students at the graduate and undergraduate levels from Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ2S (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Two-Spirit), and International communities in a student-led initiative with the mission to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity within the SoN. This coalition seeks to offer students who are often rendered invisible within the academy and society more broadly in relation to dominant cultures and normative expectations an opportunity to build relationships and expose shared histories of oppression in such a way that issues of social justice are uncovered. In response to nursing students and faculty who self-identify as members of dominant groups and who sought inclusion as allies, the leaders of the student community groups recognized a need to develop a position statement on allyship. The collaboration that transpired between the four groups of communities to develop the position statement led to the formation of the Student Equity Coalition.

In the quest for gender equity, medicine, with its abundance of highly educated and qualified women, should be leading the way. The sheer number of women who comprise the majority of pediatricians in the United States suggests this specialty has a unique opportunity to stand out as progressively equitable. Indeed, there has been much progress to celebrate for women in medicine and pediatrics. However, many challenges remain, and there are areas in which progress is too slow, stalled, or even regressing. The fair treatment of women pediatricians will require enhanced and simultaneous commitment from leaders in 4 key gatekeeper groups: academic medical centers, hospitals, health care organizations, and practices; medical societies; journals; and funding agencies. In this report, we describe the 6-step equity, diversity, and inclusion cycle, which provides a strategic methodology to (1) examine equity, diversity, and inclusion data; (2) share results with stakeholders; (3) investigate causality; (4) implement strategic interventions; (5) track outcomes and adjust strategies; and (6) disseminate results. Next steps include the enforcement of a climate of transparency and accountability, with leaders prioritizing and financially supporting workforce gender equity.

Comprehensive psychiatry,2019,10,Gender distribution in psychiatry journals' editorial boards worldwide.,"Gender disparity has been documented in advanced doctoral degrees, research, and academic positions, and therefore, it can logically be deduced that the gender disparity would be found in journals' editorial boards. In this study, we sought to determine the gender distribution in editorial boards of psychiatry journals worldwide. We also studied the academic achievements of editorial board members by comparing professional background, education level, and research productivity indices. We analyzed the gender of editorial members of 119 psychiatry journals from Clarivate Analytics' Journal Citation Reports. Our data included 8423 editorial board members from which we randomly selected 10% editorial board members to represent the full sample for further analyses. Overall, women represented 30.4% of editorial board and approximately 30% in each category: (1) Editor-in-chief/deputies, (2) Associate/section editors, (3) Editorial board*, and (4) Advisory board. The majority (65%) of men were M.D. psychiatrists, and women (58%) were Ph.D. psychologists. Women in editorial leadership positions (Category 1 & 2) were correlated with fewer women in editorial or advisory boards. Women had half the mean number of publications than men while serving journals with approximately the same mean impact factor. Our study results show that, besides gender disparity, gender bias does not exist in the psychiatry journal editorial boards. Given the implication of the editorial board position on science, academic advancement, and networking, this disparity remains detrimental to achieving equity, diversity, and inclusion in academic psychiatry.",Hafeez DM

To address this, faculty in the Johns Hopkins Department of Pathology established an outreach program and funded rotation for students underrepresented in medicine and from disadvantaged groups. The aims were to increase exposure to the field and improve diversity, inclusion, and equity in pathology. A 1-month rotation for students underrepresented in medicine was established in 2013. Rotation schedules tailored to each rotator's interests included resident conferences and individual faculty meetings. In 2016, a proactive outreach program was established. Faculty visited historically black medical schools and underrepresented in medicine student groups at other institutions, where they gave a ""Careers in Pathology"" presentation targeted to second- and third-year medical students. Faculty also attended underrepresented in medicine student conferences and participated in high school student programs to further expand the underrepresented in medicine pipeline into medicine and pathology. Since 2016, fourteen outreach presentations have been delivered. The number of rotators increased from 1 in 2013 to 18 in July 2019. Rotators self-identified as African, African American, Hispanic, and Native American. Most were second- to fourth-year medical students, and 1 was a pathology resident. Six rotators are currently pathology residents, and others are strongly considering applying to pathology. The outreach efforts account for the success of our rotation, which, in turn, has had a positive impact on interest in pathology.

Faculty and administrators' experiential experience in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plays a role in the success or failure of DEI training. DEI training at institutes of higher learning should include metrics that examine our bias for invisible and overt support for DEI. Methods: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholars (RWJFNFS) were surveyed by The Gauda Group at Grayling. Data were collected from a diverse group of scholars across the nation. An online survey followed by an in-depth phone interview was used to assess participants' roles as leaders in academic nursing, challenges faced by scholars in addressing DEI, and perceived values of undertaking DEI activities. Results: Major themes emerged from the findings. The themes included championing for DEI comes with a personal and professional risk. Greater success was noted when DEI was supported by leadership and included in institutional strategic planning. Conclusion: DEI is important and necessitates commitment from all levels of leadership, faculty, and strategic planning initiatives. DEI training fills an important role and subsidizes leadership effectiveness as it relates to DEI.",Johnson-Mallard V
Advances in physiology education,2019,6,Implementing inclusive practices in an active learning STEM classroom.,"What do you bring to a conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion? While acknowledging this conversation is important, many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty shy away from engaging these topics. STEM educators often hesitate to participate in these discussions due to their self-perceived lack of knowledge or training. However, as institutions welcome ever-diversifying student populations, STEM faculty must consider how their teaching and mentoring approaches affect their students. During the 2018 American Physiological Society (APS) Institute for Teaching and Learning, STEM faculty and administrators engaged in conversations to better understand how their own approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion affect the success of their students. During my plenary workshop, ""Inclusive Practices for Diverse Student Populations,"" participants investigated their own perspectives and practices. They also discussed approaches to implementing inclusive practices that complement active pedagogical best practices. In an attempt to replicate this workshop environment, I ask you to engage with an interactive set of exercises to investigate your own perspective on the topics of diversity, inclusion, and equity. After you consider your own approaches to these topics, I provide practical examples of inclusive practices that align or enhance active leaning pedagogy. By building confidence, providing support, and promoting various pathways to success, inclusive practices enhance student learning and decrease social disparities in STEM education, ultimately supporting STEM innovation.",Johnson KMS
CBE life sciences education,2019,6,Applying Graph Theory to Examine the Dynamics of Student Discussions in Small-Group Learning.,"Group work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses is an effective means of improving student outcomes, and many different factors can influence the dynamics of student discussions and, ultimately, the success of collaboration. The substance and dynamics of group discussions are commonly examined using qualitative methods such as discourse analysis. To complement existing work in the literature, we developed a quantitative methodology that uses graph theory to map the progression of talk-turns of discussions within a group. We observed groups of students working with peer facilitators to solve problems in biological sciences, with three iterations of data collection and two major refinements of graph theory calculations. Results include general behaviors based on the turns in which different individuals talk and graph theory parameters to quantify group characteristics. To demonstrate the potential utility of the methodology, we present case studies with distinct patterns: a centralized group in which the peer facilitator behaves like an authority figure, a decentralized group in which most students talk their fair share of turns, and a larger group with subgroups that have implications for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Together, these results demonstrate that our adaptation of graph theory is a viable quantitative methodology to examine group discussions.",Chai A

However, limited work has evaluated public health units, as employers, in ensuring equitable workplaces. Public health units must examine their policies for promoting equity, diversity, and inclusiveness. We suggest strategies that these organizations may adopt to establish a diverse workforce, including programs of responsibility, broader advertisement of employment opportunities, and standardized application processes. These practices are site dependent and are more effective when supported by senior management. By considering these strategies, institutions of public health can improve equity, diversity, and inclusion in their workplaces while addressing health equity in the communities they serve.",Shahi A

In recent years, the surgical training boards have gone to considerable effort to achieve greater transparency and fairness in their selection processes, and to identify those attributes that are believed to best predict future success as a surgeon. This is consistent with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Diversity and Inclusion Plan, which places emphasis on gender equity and has goals that include increasing the attractiveness of surgery as a vocation for women, removing impediments to them applying to the surgical training programmes and removing any biases that might disadvantage them during the selection process.",Beasley SW

Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2019,1,Promises and Pitfalls of Diversity Statements: Proceed With Caution.,"As part of their efforts to increase the diversity of their workforce and student body, medical schools, academic medical centers, and individual departments are increasingly crafting public statements about their value for and commitment to diversity. For these statements to effectively enhance diversity, however, care must be taken, as research shows that some diversity-related messages can backfire. To avoid the pitfalls and realize the promise of diversity statements, this article presents recommendations based on experimental studies that investigate the impact of diversity messages. These studies suggest that diversity statements be aspirational, emphasize autonomy, and express a value for difference. Aspirational statements avoid creating the impression that equity has been achieved, thus preventing the ""illusion of fairness"" and the ""paradox of meritocracy,"" wherein espousing egalitarian values and the existence of a meritocracy can increase biased outcomes and workplace disparities. Statements that emphasize autonomy avoid the backlash that can occur when organizational members feel coerced into adopting prodiversity actions. Statements that emphasize the value of human differences convey a multicultural message that has shown positive outcomes compared with ""colorblind"" statements that acknowledge our common humanity. Although there are no studies specific to academic medicine, current research on a variety of organizations, including some studies from the health care industry, suggests that relying on these recommendations to craft a diversity statement may help contribute to academic medical centers' larger efforts to promote diversity and inclusion and may help them avoid some deleterious effects.",Carnes M

"Lancet (London, England)",2018,4,Canada's global health role: supporting equity and global citizenship as a middle power.,"Canada's history of nation building, combined with its status as a so-called middle power in international affairs, has been translated into an approach to global health that is focused on equity and global citizenship. Canada has often aspired to be a socially progressive force abroad, using alliance building and collective action to exert influence beyond that expected from a country with moderate financial and military resources. Conversely, when Canada has primarily used economic self-interest to define its global role, the country's perceived leadership in global health has diminished. Current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values, driven by appreciation for diversity, equality, and Canada's responsibility to be a good global citizen. However, poor coordination of efforts, limited funding, and the unaddressed legacy of Canada's colonisation of Indigenous peoples weaken the potential for Canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity. Amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world, the Canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage. Such leadership will require the translation of aspirational messages about health equity and inclusion into concrete action at home and internationally.",Nixon SA

According to the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) at the NIH, diversity refers to the inclusion of the following traditionally underrepresented groups: African Americans/Blacks, Asians (>30 countries), American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Latino or Hispanic (20 countries). Gender, culture, and socioeconomic status are also important dimensions of diversity, which may define some underrepresented groups. The under-representation of specific groups in both the biomedical informatics workforce as well as in the patient-derived data that is being used for research purposes has contributed to an ongoing disparity; these groups have not experienced equity in contributing to or benefiting from advancements in informatics research. This workshop will highlight innovative efforts to increase the pool of minority informaticians and discuss examples of informatics research that addresses the health concerns that impact minority populations. This workshop topics will provide insight into overcoming pipeline issues in the development of minority informaticians while emphasizing the importance of minority participation in health related research.

Populations served by midwives value internationally educated midwives from their countries of origin. The International Midwifery Pre-Registration Program at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario, provides assessment, midwifery workplace orientation, and accelerated education for internationally educated midwives on behalf of the regulatory College of Midwives of Ontario. Between 2003 and 2015, midwives from 41 countries participated in the bridging program, and 214 (80%) successfully completed the program and qualified for licensure. Of these 214 graduates, 100% passed the Canadian Midwifery Registration Examination and 193 (90%) were employed full time as midwives within 4 months of graduation. The program curriculum enables the integration of these midwives into health care workplaces utilizing innovative approaches to assessment and competency enhancement. Critical to the bridging process are simulation-based practices to develop effective psychomotor learning, virtual and real primary care community placements, and coaching in empathetic, client-centered communication. Cultural sensitivity is embedded into the multiple assessment and learning modalities, and addresses relevant barriers faced by immigrant midwives in the workplace.

In Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is a 14-year difference in life expectancy between the predominantly African American population in north Tulsa and the predominantly Caucasian population in south Tulsa. The roots of Tulsa's health disparities can be linked, in part, to a long history of racial mistrust stemming from the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, arguably one of the worst race riots in U.S. history. In 2011, the author served as both a university campus president and chairman of the board of the Tulsa region's chamber of commerce. Through his work with the chamber, he discovered the business community's substantial resources and advocacy abilities. He also found that regional business leaders strongly supported health equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives, both as moral obligations and regional economic development imperatives. After sharing the lessons he learned from working closely with business leaders, the author encourages other academic health centers (AHCs) to reach out to their business communities, which are likely willing and able to help them undertake similar initiatives.
